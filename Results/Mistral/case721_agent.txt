APPNO: 63164/16Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No. Assistant, can you provide an argument for why this might not be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR?
Assistant:  One argument for why this might not be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR is that the applicants were aware of the rules governing reporting within Parliament, which were clearly stated and available on the Parliament website. Despite these warnings, the applicants continued to record in unauthorized areas, deliberately breaching the established rules. This behavior can be seen as a violation of the conditions set by the Parliament, which are necessary to maintain order and security within the premises. Therefore, the suspension of their accreditation could be justified as a proportionate measure to enforce these rules, rather than an unjustified restriction on their freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR. Similar cases, such as Case 483, where Hungarian Parliament members protested during a final vote on a controversial law, and Case 564, where opposition MPs created a disturbance during parliamentary proceedings, illustrate that disruptive behavior can lead to consequences that do not necessarily constitute a violation of Article 10.
Judge:  Assistant, can you provide a counter-argument to consider the other side of this case?
Assistant:  A counter-argument to consider the other side of this case is that the applicants, as journalists, have a crucial role in society to report on matters of public interest, including political issues. The suspension of their accreditation, even if it was for a short period, could be seen as a disproportionate restriction on their freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR. The applicants were exercising their journalistic duties by attempting to gather information and conduct interviews, which is a fundamental aspect of their profession. Similar cases, such as Case 317, where an association requested access to a complaint lodged with the Constitutional Court, and Case 550, where a Member of Parliament made an interpellation and expressed his views, highlight the importance of allowing journalists and public figures to express their views and gather information without undue interference. The suspension of the applicants' accreditation could be seen as a form of censorship, which is contrary to the principles of Article 10 of the ECHR. 
Judge:  Assistant, can you provide more information on the duration of the suspension and the impact it had on the applicants' ability to report on subsequent parliamentary sessions?
Assistant:  The duration of the suspension was from 26 April 2016 to 12 September 2016, a period of approximately four and a half months. During this time, the applicants were unable to access Parliament sessions, which significantly impacted their ability to report on parliamentary proceedings and gather information for their news outlets. This suspension likely hindered their journalistic duties and their freedom to report on matters of public interest, which is a key aspect of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Judge:  Thank you for the clarification. Assistant, can you provide any information on whether the applicants had any prior disciplinary actions or warnings before this incident?
Assistant:  The applicants had no prior disciplinary actions or warnings before this incident. This lack of prior disciplinary actions suggests that the suspension of their accreditation was a response to a single incident rather than a pattern of misconduct. This could be seen as a more severe restriction on their freedom of expression, as it was a first-time offense and the suspension was a significant penalty.
Judge:  Assistant, can you provide any information on whether the applicants had any alternative means to report on the parliamentary sessions during the suspension period?
Assistant:  The information on whether the applicants had alternative means to report on the parliamentary sessions during the suspension period is not available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they had other ways to gather information and report on the proceedings during that time.
Moderator:  The conversation is done. Is this a violation of article 10 based on the given case AND the interaction you just had? Answer yes or no.
Judge:  Yes.

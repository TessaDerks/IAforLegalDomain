APPNO: 61178/14Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No. Assistant, please provide an argument for why this might be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Assistant:  I am sorry, I am unable to provide an answer at this time. I will try again.
Judge:  Assistant, please provide a counter-argument for why this might not be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Assistant:  One counter-argument for why this might not be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR is that the restriction on ATV's freedom of expression was aimed at protecting public interest in credible information and balanced news coverage. Similar to case 417, where the applicants' freedom of expression was restricted to maintain public order and safety, the Hungarian authorities argued that the regulation was necessary to ensure the credibility and objectivity of news reporting. The Constitutional Court of Hungary emphasized that even widely used expressions by newsreaders could infringe on credibility and objectivity, and that newsreaders must indicate when their statements are opinions and not factual statements. This suggests that the restriction was not arbitrary but rather a measure to uphold the standards of journalism and protect the public from biased information.
Judge:  Thank you for the counter-argument. Now, please provide an argument for why this might be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Assistant:  One argument for why this might be a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR is that the restriction on ATV's freedom of expression could be seen as disproportionate and unnecessary. In similar cases, such as case 417, the applicants' freedom of expression was restricted to maintain public order and safety. However, in the ATV case, the restriction was based on a value judgment made by a newsreader, which could be considered a form of expression protected by Article 10. The Hungarian authorities' insistence on strict neutrality and objectivity in news reporting may have infringed on ATV's right to freedom of expression, as it did not allow for any form of subjective interpretation or opinion. This could be seen as a violation of Article 10, which protects not only factual information but also opinions and ideas.
Judge:  Thank you for the argument. To further clarify, what specific aspect of Article 10 do you believe was violated in this case?
Assistant:  The specific aspect of Article 10 that might have been violated in this case is the right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority. The restriction imposed on ATV's newsreader could be seen as an interference with the right to impart information and ideas, as it prevented the newsreader from expressing a value judgment, which is a form of opinion protected by Article 10. Additionally, the lack of clear criteria for what constitutes a biased value judgment and the potential for arbitrary application of the Media Act could raise concerns about the proportionality and necessity of the restriction, as required by Article 10(2) of the ECHR.
Judge:  Thank you for the clarification. To ensure a thorough understanding, could you provide a counter-argument to the point that the restriction might have violated the right to impart information and ideas?
Assistant:  A counter-argument to the point that the restriction might have violated the right to impart information and ideas is that the restriction was aimed at maintaining the credibility and objectivity of news reporting, which is a legitimate aim in a democratic society. Similar to cases 417, 467, 483, and 485, where the applicants' freedom of expression was restricted to maintain public order, safety, and the credibility of information, the Hungarian authorities argued that the regulation was necessary to ensure the credibility and objectivity of news reporting. The Constitutional Court of Hungary emphasized that even widely used expressions by newsreaders could infringe on credibility and objectivity, and that newsreaders must indicate when their statements are opinions and not factual statements. This suggests that the restriction was not arbitrary but rather a measure to uphold the standards of journalism and protect the public from biased information. Therefore, the restriction on ATV's freedom of expression could be seen as a justified interference with the right to impart information and ideas, as it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim.

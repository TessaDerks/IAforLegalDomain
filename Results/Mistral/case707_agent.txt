APPNO: 6512/13Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No. Assistant, can you provide an argument for why this case might be considered a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR?
Assistant:  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a specific argument at this time due to the lack of relevant similar cases. However, I can suggest that the applicant's right to freedom of expression, as protected by Article 10 of the ECHR, may have been violated if the fine and arrest were disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by the authorities. The applicant was exercising his right to freedom of expression by filming the demonstration, and the use of force and subsequent fine could be seen as an infringement of this right. The court's decision to replace the fine with a warning suggests that the initial penalty may have been disproportionate. Furthermore, the applicant's right to freedom of assembly, also protected by Article 11 of the ECHR, may have been violated if the authorities' actions were intended to prevent him from participating in the demonstration. However, this argument is not directly related to Article 10 and should be considered separately.
Judge:  Thank you for the input. Assistant, can you provide a counter-argument to consider the other side of the case?
Assistant:  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a specific counter-argument at this time due to the lack of relevant similar cases. However, it is important to consider that the authorities may have had legitimate reasons for their actions, such as maintaining public order and safety during the demonstration. The applicant's filming of the event could have been perceived as disruptive or potentially inciting further unrest, justifying the gendarmes' intervention. Additionally, the court's decision to replace the fine with a warning indicates that the authorities acknowledged the need for a proportionate response, which could suggest that the initial actions were not disproportionate. Furthermore, the applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection in court may have limited the court's ability to fully address his arguments regarding the unconstitutionality of the relevant law. This could imply that the applicant did not sufficiently challenge the legality of the authorities' actions, potentially weakening his case for a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Judge:  Thank you for the counter-argument. Assistant, can you provide a response to the counter-argument that the authorities may have had legitimate reasons for their actions, such as maintaining public order and safety during the demonstration?
Assistant:  While maintaining public order and safety is a legitimate aim, the authorities' actions must still be proportionate and necessary. The use of force and subsequent fine against the applicant, who was merely filming the demonstration, could be seen as disproportionate. The European Court of Human Rights has previously ruled that even in situations where public order is at stake, the authorities must ensure that any restrictions on freedom of expression are proportionate and necessary in a democratic society. The court's decision to replace the fine with a warning suggests that the initial penalty may have been disproportionate, indicating that the authorities' actions could have violated the applicant's right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR.
Judge:  Assistant, can you address the point that the applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection in court may have limited the court's ability to fully address his arguments?
Assistant:  The applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection in court does not necessarily negate the potential violation of Article 10 of the ECHR. The court's ability to examine the constitutionality of the law is separate from the substantive issue of whether the applicant's rights were violated. The focus should be on whether the authorities' actions were proportionate and necessary, regardless of the applicant's procedural steps in court. The European Court of Human Rights has emphasized that the protection of freedom of expression under Article 10 is fundamental and must be upheld even if procedural errors occur. Therefore, the applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection should not be a decisive factor in determining whether his rights were violated.
Judge:  Thank you for the clarification. Assistant, can you summarize the key points that support a potential violation of Article 10 of the ECHR in this case?
Assistant:  The key points that support a potential violation of Article 10 of the ECHR in this case are: The applicants argued that the measure taken by the domestic courts prevented them from accessing YouTube, which violated their right to freedom to receive and impart information and ideas as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. The applicants submitted that the blocking order was not prescribed by law and that the consequences of the blocking order were disproportionate to the aims pursued. The applicants argued that the proceedings leading to the blocking of YouTube could not be regarded as fair and impartial. The first applicant submitted that he was a lecturer in law and a legal practitioner in the field of freedom of expression who regularly used visual material uploaded on YouTube in his activities. The second and third applicants argued that YouTube was a unique platform on account of its characteristics, its accessibility, and its potential impact, and that there were no equivalents that could replace it. The Government contested the applicants' arguments and submitted that the applicants could not be said to have been directly affected by the facts allegedly constituting the interference. The Court found that the measure in question constituted 'interference by' the authorities in the exercise of the applicants' right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.

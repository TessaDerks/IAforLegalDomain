APPNO: 24227/09Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No.

Can you provide an argument for why the applicants' use of the honorific "sayın" in their letters could be seen as a legitimate restriction on the prison authorities' ability to maintain order and discipline in the prison?
Assistant:  The applicants' use of the honorific 'sayın' in their letters could be seen as a legitimate restriction on the prison authorities' ability to maintain order and discipline in the prison, as it may be perceived as an attempt to promote or glorify the banned organization, thereby undermining the authority of the prison administration.
Judge:  That's an interesting point. However, doesn't the use of the honorific "sayın" simply express esteem, which is a neutral term? How does that necessarily promote or glorify the organization?
Assistant:  The use of the honorific 'sayın' in the applicants' letters may be seen as a neutral expression of esteem, rather than an attempt to promote or glorify the banned organization. This could suggest that the restriction on their use of the honorific was not justified.
Judge:  That's a good point. But doesn't the fact that the applicants were convicted of membership in an illegal organization and were writing to the leader of that organization while in prison, suggest that their use of the honorific "sayın" was not entirely neutral? 

Can you provide a counter-argument to this point?
Assistant:  While the fact that the applicants were convicted of membership in an illegal organization and were writing to the leader of that organization while in prison may suggest that their use of the honorific 'sayın' was not entirely neutral, it is also possible that their intention was simply to express esteem and respect for the leader, rather than to promote or glorify the organization. This could be seen as a legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression, as protected by Article 10 of the ECHR.
Judge:  That's a good counter-argument. However, doesn't the fact that the applicants were punished for their use of the honorific "sayın" suggest that the prison authorities were not simply concerned with maintaining order and discipline, but were also trying to suppress the applicants' expression of esteem for the leader of the banned organization?

But doesn't the fact that the applicants were punished for violating penitentiary regulations, rather than for any specific content of their letters, suggest that the prison authorities were primarily concerned with maintaining order and discipline, rather than suppressing the applicants' expression of esteem?

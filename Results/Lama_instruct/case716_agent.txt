APPNO: 44229/11Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No.

Assistant, can you provide an argument for why this case might be a violation of article 10?
Assistant:  The seizure of the applicant's server and the subsequent interference with his anime website may be seen as a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR, as it restricts the applicant's right to freedom of expression and information. This is because the seizure of the server and the website's subsequent closure may be seen as an excessive restriction on the applicant's right to express himself and share information with others.
Judge:  That's a good point. However, I'm not convinced yet. Can you provide a counter-argument to this, considering that the applicant's website was hosting copyrighted material without permission?
Assistant:  While the applicant's website was hosting copyrighted material without permission, the seizure of the server and the subsequent interference with the website may still be seen as a disproportionate restriction on the applicant's right to freedom of expression and information. This is because the applicant had invested significant effort and resources into the website, which was visited by 500-600 users daily, and the seizure caused significant financial damage and loss of reputation. Furthermore, the applicant's website was not solely dedicated to copyright infringement, but also hosted personal correspondence of users and a software product he was developing.
Judge:  I see your point. However, I'm still not convinced that this is a clear-cut case of a violation of article 10. Can you provide an argument on why the seizure of the server was necessary to prevent copyright infringement, and whether the measures taken by the authorities were proportionate to the infringement committed?

Judge:  I'm not convinced by your previous argument. Can you provide a counter-argument to the applicant's claim that the seizure of the server was a disproportionate restriction on his right to freedom of expression and information? 

In particular, I'd like to know if the applicant's website was a significant contributor to copyright infringement, and whether the authorities had other means to address the infringement without seizing the entire server.

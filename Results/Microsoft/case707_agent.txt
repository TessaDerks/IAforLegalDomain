APPNO: 6512/13Moderator:  Is this a violation of article 10 only based on the case presented now? Answer yes or no. Then ask the assistant for an argument or counter argument to form a better opinion on this case
Judge:  No.

Judge: Could you provide an argument supporting the view that there was a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR in this case?

Assistant: An argument supporting a violation of Article 10 could be that the applicant was exercising his right to freedom of expression and information by filming the demonstration. The arrest and subsequent fine for disturbing the public peace could be seen as an interference with these rights, especially since the applicant argued he was not participating in the demonstration or chanting slogans. The imposition of a fine, even if later replaced by a warning, might be considered disproportionate and not necessary in a democratic society, thus violating Article 10.

Judge: What is a counter-argument against the view that there was a violation of Article 10?

Assistant: A counter-argument could be that the court found the applicant was fined not for expressing his views but for disturbing the public peace. The court's decision to replace the fine with a warning suggests that the authorities considered the interference minimal and proportionate. Additionally, the applicant did not raise an unconstitutionality objection, which limited the court's ability to examine the broader implications of the law under which he was fined.

Judge: Could the manner in which the applicant was treated by the gendarmes affect the assessment of whether there was a violation of Article 10?

Assistant: Yes, the manner in which the applicant was treated could affect the assessment. If the gendarmes' actions were deemed abusive or excessive, it might suggest that the interference with the applicant's rights was not justified or proportionate, potentially supporting a violation of Article 10. The applicant's claim of physical aggression and arrest without reason could indicate that the authorities did not act in accordance with the law, which is a requirement under Article 10(2) for any interference with the right to freedom of expression.

Judge: How significant is the applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection in this context?

Assistant: The applicant's failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection is significant because it limited the court's ability to assess whether the law under which he was fined was compatible with the ECHR. This procedural aspect could be seen as a missed opportunity to challenge the law's compatibility with Article 10, potentially affecting the overall assessment of whether there was a violation. However, the focus remains on whether the interference with the applicant's rights was justified and proportionate under Article 10(2).
Assistant:  In case 526, the Court found that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression was proportionate and necessary in a democratic society. The applicant was convicted and imprisoned for participating in a demonstration, but the Court determined that the interference was prescribed by law and pursued legitimate aims such as preventing disorder and crime, and protecting the rights and freedoms of others. Consequently, the Court found no violation of Article 11 of the Convention. This suggests that in situations where the interference with freedom of expression is justified by legitimate aims and is proportionate, it may not constitute a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR.
Judge:  The case you mentioned, 526, highlights the importance of assessing whether the interference with freedom of expression is both prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society. In the current case, the key issues are whether the applicant's actions were legitimately restricted and whether the response by authorities was proportionate.

### Considerations for the Current Case:

1. **Prescribed by Law**: The applicant was fined under a law that criminalizes disturbing the public peace. The law's application must be clear and accessible to individuals.

2. **Legitimate Aim**: The authorities claimed the fine was for disturbing the public peace, not for the content of the applicant's expression. The aim of maintaining public order can be a legitimate ground for interference.

3. **Necessity and Proportionality**: The applicant was filming a public demonstration, which is generally protected under freedom of expression. The physical aggression and arrest without clear justification could be seen as disproportionate, especially since the fine was later replaced by a warning.

4. **Impact on Expression**: The applicant argued he was not participating in the demonstration or chanting slogans, suggesting his filming was an exercise of his right to gather information.

### Conclusion:

While the court replaced the fine with a warning, indicating a minimal interference, the manner of the applicant's treatment by the gendarmes raises concerns about proportionality and necessity. If the interference was not justified or was excessive, it could constitute a violation of Article 10. The failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection limits the examination of the law's compatibility with the ECHR, but the focus remains on whether the interference was justified and proportionate.

In summary, the case presents arguments both for and against a violation of Article 10, with significant weight on the proportionality and necessity of the authorities' actions.
Assistant:  In assessing whether there was a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR in this case, several factors need to be considered. The applicant was filming a public demonstration, which is generally protected under the right to freedom of expression. The arrest and fine for disturbing the public peace could be seen as an interference with this right. However, the court found that the interference was not for the content of the expression but for maintaining public order, which can be a legitimate aim. The replacement of the fine with a warning suggests that the interference was minimal. Nonetheless, the manner of the applicant's treatment by the gendarmes, including physical aggression and arrest without clear justification, raises concerns about proportionality and necessity. If the interference was not justified or was excessive, it could constitute a violation of Article 10. The failure to raise an unconstitutionality objection limits the examination of the law's compatibility with the ECHR, but the focus remains on whether the interference was justified and proportionate. In summary, while there are arguments both for and against a violation, the key issue is whether the authorities' actions were proportionate and necessary in a democratic society.
Judge:  In conclusion, the determination of whether there was a violation of Article 10 of the ECHR hinges on the proportionality and necessity of the authorities' actions. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Proportionality and Necessity**: The applicant's filming of a public demonstration is a protected activity under Article 10. The authorities' response, including physical aggression and arrest without clear justification, may be seen as disproportionate, especially since the fine was later replaced by a warning. This suggests that the interference might not have been necessary in a democratic society.

2. **Legitimate Aim**: While maintaining public order is a legitimate aim, the manner in which the applicant was treated raises questions about whether the interference was justified. The court's decision to replace the fine with a warning indicates that the interference was minimal, but the initial actions of the gendarmes could still be problematic.

3. **Prescribed by Law**: The law under which the applicant was fined must be clear and accessible. The court's inability to examine the unconstitutionality of the law due to the applicant's failure to raise an objection limits the assessment of its compatibility with the ECHR.

4. **Impact on Expression**: The applicant's argument that he was not participating in the demonstration or chanting slogans supports the view that his filming was an exercise of his right to gather information, not an act of disturbing the peace.

Given these considerations, there are strong arguments that the interference with the applicant's rights was not justified or proportionate, potentially constituting a violation of Article 10. The manner of the applicant's treatment by the gendarmes is particularly concerning and could indicate a violation if deemed excessive or unjustified.

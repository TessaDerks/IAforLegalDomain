Mr Miguel Castells, a Spanish national, resides at San Sebastián (Guipúzcoa), where he is a lawyer. At the material time he was a senator elected on the list of Herri Batasuna, a political grouping supporting independence for the Basque Country.', 'A. The particular circumstances of the case', '1. The disputed article', '7. In the week of 4 to 11 June 1979, the weekly magazine ""Punto y Hora de Euskalherria"" published an article entitled Insultante Impunidad (Outrageous Impunity) and signed by the applicant. The article read as follows:', '""In a few days, at the San Fermín holiday, a year will have gone by since the murders of Germán Rodríguez atPamplona (Iruna) and of Joseba Barandiarán at San Sebastián (Donosti). The authorities have not identified the perpetrators of these crimes. They have not even acknowledged to which organisations they belong. Nor have they identified the persons who killed, between 12 and15 May 1977, Gregorio Marichalar Ayestarán, aged 63, and Rafael Gómez Jaúregui, aged 78, at Rentería, José Luis Canoat Irun and Manuel Fuentes Mesa at Ortuella; on 14 May,again in 1977, José Luis Aristizábal at San Sebastián, and,at around the same date, in the same town, IsidroSusperregui Aldekoa, over 70 years old; at the beginning ofJune, still in 1977, Javier Núñez Fernández at Bilbao;Francisco Aznar Clemente, Pedro María Martínez Ocio,Romualdo Barroso Chaparro, Juan José Castillo and Bienvenido Pereda Moral, on 3 March 1976 at Gasteiz, and,in the same year, on 7 March at Basauri, Vicente AntónFerrero, on 9 May at Montejurra, Aniano Jiménez and RicardoPellejero, in June Alberto Romero Soliño at Eibar, in September Jesús María Zabala at Fuenterrabía, in November Santiago Navas and José Javier Nuin at Santesteban and on10 July Normi Menchaka at Santurce; José Emilio Fernández Pérez, 16 years old, and Felipe Carro Flores, 15 years old, on 24 July and 25 July 1978, one at Apatomonasterio and the other at Sestao. I only mention the dead ones and the list is far from being exhaustive. These are only examples. Not one, I repeat, not one of the murders, of the interminable list of fascist murders carried out in the Basque Country (Euzkadi), has shown the slightest sign of being cleared up by the authorities. Will the individuals who assassinated Emilia Larrea, Roberto Aramburu, JosemariIturrioz, Agurtzane Arregui, Argala, José Ramon Ansa and Gladys del Estal, the most recent murders, be identified? And when I say most recent I should specify the date - 9 June 1979 - because tomorrow there will be others.', 'And there remain the hundreds of cases, for there are hundreds of them, in which people burst in, pistols at the ready, to the bars of the villages and the suburbs (Amorebieta, Durango, Eguía, Loyola, etc.) or simply run through the streets wounding and beating up everyone they come across; the bombs left in popular meeting places(Punto y Hora, Bordatxo, Alay Bar, Santi Bar, Askatasunaetc.) or in cars, attacks whose survivors suffer the consequences for life etc.', ""The perpetrators of these crimes act, continue to work and remain in posts of responsibility, with total impunity. No warrant has been issued for their arrest. The description of the persons who carried out these acts has been neither drawn up or published; nor have there been any lists of suspects in the newspapers, or photokit pictures, and, far less, rewards offered to the public, or arrests, or inspections or searches of their homes. The public's help has not been sought through the media, as has happened in other cases. Indeed it is significant that such help is not even accepted in connection with these crimes. No link has been established, there have been no official communiqués full of explicit accusations and reprobation inthe press, as in other cases."", ""The right-wing, who are in power, have all the means at their disposal (police, courts and prisons) to seek out and punish the perpetrators of so many crimes. But don't worry, the right will not seek itself out."", 'Extreme right-wing organisations? Before Franco\'s death no one in the Basque Country thought that it was possible to secure the arrest or conviction for"" unlawful association"" of a single member, and far less one of the leaders, of the ""Triple A"", of the ""Batallón Vasco-Español"", of the ""Batallón Guezalaga"", of the ATE, of the Adolf Hitler commando, of the Francisco Franco commando, ofthe Mussolini commando, of the New Order, of Omega, of the""Movimiento Social Español"", of ""Acción Nacional Española""or of the ""Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey"". No one can believe it now either.', '""ETA"" members held as prisoners? Hundreds of them havebeen to prison. Persons suspected of being members of ""ETA""? Thousands of them have been detained in police stations. Sympathisers? One could go on with the list forever. Yet not a single leader or member of the Triple A has been bothered.', 'Those responsible for public order and criminal prosecutions are the same today as they were before. And here in the Basque Country nothing has changed as far as impunity and questions of liability are concerned.', 'The period when Ibanez Freire was Director General of the Civil Guard, and Fraga was Minister of the Interior, wasalso a time when there was a great increase in so- called extreme right-wing activities in the Basque Country. The same phenomenon, the same coincidences are recurring now.', 'The increase in the activities of groups free to act asthey will is generally accompanied in the Basque Country byan increase in the strength of the security forces.', 'These commandos, because we have to call them something, seem totally at home in the Basque Country, in the middle of a community completely hostile to them. This is too inexplicable for there not to be an obvious explanation. They have precise information to carry out their attacks, often more detailed than that available to local people.', 'They have substantial files which are kept up to date. They have a considerable supply of weapons and of money. They have unlimited material and resources and operate with complete impunity. Considering the timing of their operations and the conditions in which they are carried out it can be said that they are guaranteed legal immunity in advance. Forbidding people to see this is futile.', 'This is important to the people. In the Basque Country it is more important than all the provisional schemes for self -government, democratic consensus and other meaningless or abstract nonsense, because it is a visible, tangible reality which confronts people on a daily basis.', 'Frankly, I do not believe that the fascist associations which I cited earlier have any independent existence, outside the State apparatus. In other words I do not believe that they actually exist. Despite all these different badges, it is always the same people.', 'Behind these acts there can only be the Government, the party of the Government and their personnel. We know that they are increasingly going to use as a political instrument the ruthless hunting down of Basque dissidents and their physical elimination. If they want to be so lacking in a sense of political vision that\'s their problem! But for the sake of the next victim from our people, those responsible must be identified right away with maximum publicity.""', '2. The criminal proceedings against the applicant', '(a) The judicial investigation', ""8. On 3 July 1979 the prosecuting authorities instituted criminal proceedings against Mr Castells for insulting the Government (Article 161 of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 20 below). The court with competence for the investigation procedure, the Supreme Court, requested the Senate to withdraw the applicant's parliamentary immunity, which it did by a majority on 27 May 1981."", '9. On 7 July 1981 the Supreme Court charged the applicant with having proffered serious insults against the Government and civil servants (Articles 161 para. 1 and 242 of the Criminal Code). It further ordered his detention on remand, taking into account the sentences laid down for the offences in question (six to twelve years\'imprisonment; see paragraph 20 below), but allowed his release on bail in view of his status as a senator and the ""lack of alarm"" (falta de alarma) caused by the alleged offences.', ""On 28 September 1981 the court varied its previous decision. It allowed the applicant's provisional release subject solely to the obligation to report to the judge at regular intervals. In addition to the circumstances already cited, it stressed that, during his questioning, Mr Castells had shown a co-operative attitude and had declared that his article had been intended merely as a political denunciation and not to insult or threaten the Government or its members."", ""10. On 12 December 1981 the applicant's defence counsel challenged four of the five members of the relevant division of the Supreme Court. It was submitted that their political convictions and the posts which they had held under the previous political regime disqualified them from hearing a case concerning the freedom of opinion of an individual who, like the applicant, had been a notorious opponent of the regime in question. They relied on Article 54 para. 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."", 'After several interlocutory applications, including one which resulted in a decision of the Constitutional Court on 12 July 1982 enjoining the Supreme Court to find the challenge admissible, the latter court, sitting in plenary session, dismissed the challenge on its merits on 11 January 1983. The Supreme Court took the view that although the judges had indeed sat in the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court under the previous political regime and one of them had, from 1966 to 1968, been the presiding judge in the Public Order Court, they had at that time merely applied the legislation in force.', 'On 4 May 1983 the Constitutional Court dismissed an appeal (amparo) which Mr Castells had lodged alleging a violation of Article 24 para. 2 of the Constitution (right to an impartial tribunal). It found that the fact that the judges in question might have political convictions differing from those of the applicant could not be regarded as being of direct or indirect relevance (interés directo o indirecto) to the solution of the dispute within the meaning of Article 54 para. 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '11. In the meantime the investigation of the case had progressed. On 3 February 1982 the public prosecutor had concluded that the facts constituted an offence of proffering serious insults against the Government and demanded a prison sentence of six years and a day.', ""In their memorial (conclusiones provisionales) of 2 April 1982, the defence lawyers contended that the disputed article contained accurate information and did not express the accused's personal opinion, but the views of the general public. They offered to adduce evidence to establish the truth of the information. In particular they suggested that the competent authorities should produce reports on any police inquiries, detentions, prosecutions or other measures undertaken against the members of the extreme right-wing groups responsible for the attacks denounced in the article; as the facts reported were common knowledge they could not be said to be insulting. In addition, the defence lawyers requested that evidence be taken from fifty-two witnesses, including members of the Belgian, Italian, French, English, Irish and Danish parliaments and of the European Parliament, on the matter of parliamentary practice regarding the freedom of political criticism; they argued that the accused had acted in his capacity as an elected representative and in conformity with the obligations attaching thereto."", '12. By decision (Auto) of 19 May 1982, the Supreme Court refused to admit the majority of the evidence put forward by the defence, on the ground that it was intended to show the truth of the information disseminated.', 'There were divergences in academic opinion and even in its own case-law as to whether the defence of truth (exceptio veritatis) could be pleaded in respect of insults directed at the State institutions, but the reforms of the Criminal Code then under way clarified the question: those institutions fell outside the scope of that defence and Article 461 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) authorised it only where civil servants were involved. The evidence which the defence proposed to adduce was not therefore admissible in the proceedings pending, without prejudice to the possibility available to the accused of instituting criminal proceedings as he considered fit.', 'Mr Castells filed an appeal (recurso de súplica), but on 16 June 1982 the Supreme Court confirmed its decision on the ground that the accuracy of the information was not decisive for a charge of insulting the Government.', 'The applicant then filed an appeal (amparo) in the Constitutional Court, alleging that the rights of the defence had been disregarded. That court dismissed it on 10 November 1982, holding that the question could be resolved only in the light of the proceedings in their entirety and after the decision of the trial court.', '(b) The trial', '13. The Criminal Division of the Supreme Court held a hearing on 27 October 1983 and gave judgment on 31 October. It sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of one year and a day for proffering insults of a less serious kind (menos graves) against the Government; as an accessory penalty he was also disqualified for the same period from holding any public office and exercising a profession and ordered to pay costs.', ""It found in the first place, with regard to the objective element of the offence, that the expressions used in the article were sufficiently strong to damage the reputation of the injured parties and to reveal an attitude of contempt. As far as the subjective element was concerned, it considered that, as a senator, Mr Castells had available to him very obvious means of expression, provided for in the Assembly's rules of procedure, through which to carry out his duties of monitoring and criticising the Government's activities; as he had failed to use these means, he could not claim to have acted on behalf of his electorate. The defence's second argument, based on the aim of political criticism (animus criticandi), did not remove its defamatory purpose (animus injuriandi), but reduced the importance thereof. In the case under examination, the insults proffered with the aim of political criticism had exceeded the permissible limits of such criticism and attacked the Government's honour. It was therefore preferable to apply Article 162 of the Criminal Code, which provided for the offence of proffering less serious insults against the Government, rather than Article 161. On the question of the constitutional right to freedom of expression (Article 20 of the Constitution; see paragraph 19 below) there were limits to that right, in particular in relation to the right to honour and to a private life and the right to control use of one's likeness. Furthermore, the fact that the insult appeared in a press article suggested that it was the fruit of a more complicated intellectual process and a degree of reasoning which made it more clear and precise."", 'Finally, the Supreme Court confirmed its decision of 19 May 1982 regarding the admissibility of the defence of truth.', 'The applicant again indicated in the Supreme Court his intention of filing an appeal (amparo) against the judgment, relying inter alia on Articles 14, 20, 23 and 24 of the Constitution. He lodged his appeal on 22 November 1983.', '14. On 6 December 1983 the Supreme Court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, stayed for two years the enforcement of the prison sentence (Article 93 of the Criminal Code), but left in place the accessory penalty. The enforcement of the latter measure was nevertheless stayed by the Constitutional Court on 22 February 1984.', '3. The appeal (amparo) to the Constitutional Court', ""15. In his appeal (amparo) of 22 November 1983, Mr Castells complained that he had not been able to have the Supreme Court's judgment examined by a higher court and of the length of the proceedings."", 'He maintained further that the court had violated the principle of the presumption of innocence by refusing to allow him to adduce evidence. He considered it contrary to the most elementary rules of justice to convict someone - and in this case a senator - for making statements which were accurate and sufficiently important for it to be necessary to bring them to the attention of the community as a matter of urgency and in detail, without having allowed him to establish their truth.', 'He alleged, in addition, a breach of the principle of equality before the law (Article 14 of the Constitution), taken alone or in conjunction with the right to freedom of expression (Article 20), as other persons had published similar articles without encountering difficulties. Furthermore, he claimed that he had been the victim of a violation of his right to formulate political criticism, which he argued was inherent in Article 23 as it applied to him in his capacity as a senator. According to him, that provision, which guarantees the right to participate in public affairs, entitled him to carry out his parliamentary duties of scrutiny through any organ or means generally available.', 'The applicant made a further reference to Article 20 of the Constitution in the summary of his complaints (suplico).', '16. In his observations of 22 March 1984, the public prosecutor noted that Article 14 guaranteed equality before the law and not equality outside the law. As regards the complaint based on Article 23, it overlapped with the preceding complaint or was based on a misunderstanding: clearly a member of parliament did not carry out his duties only in the assembly, but outside it he did not enjoy any immunity; although he could, like any citizen, criticise the action of the Government, he should not forget that the freedom of expression had its limits, fixed by the Constitution.', 'For his part, Mr Castells, by a letter of 21 May 1984, again offered to prove the truth of his statements, because that demonstrated ""the violation by the contested judgment of the right to `receive and communicate true information by any means of dissemination\', referred to in Article 20 of the Constitution"". He also mentioned this right in his appeal (recurso de súplica) against the rejection of this offer by the Constitutional Court ( 20 July 1984 ) and in his observations of 21 February 1985.', '17. The Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal on 10 April 1985.', 'In summarising the applicant\'s complaints at point 2 of the ""As to the Law"" part of its judgment, it took together, like the public prosecutor, those relating to Articles 14 and 23, without referring to Article 20: alleged violation of the right to equality before the law, guaranteed under Article 14 taken alone or in conjunction with Article 23, inasmuch as the contested decision restricted the powers of monitoring, scrutiny and criticism of a senator.', 'At point 6 it stated that parliamentary privileges were to be interpreted strictly as otherwise they could become instruments for infringing the rights of others; they lapsed when their holder had acted as a mere citizen, even in his capacity as a politician.', 'At points 9 and 10 it considered the central issue: the right to rely on relevant evidence in presenting the defence case, and in particular to plead the defence of truth in respect of an offence of the type in question. The court noted in this connection:', '""In order to assess whether evidence which it is sought to adduce is relevant, it is necessary to establish a link between that evidence and the thema decidendi, which must first be determined on the basis of the parties\'allegations. Except in the case of facts which are manifest or common knowledge, the court must not intervene in this regard, otherwise it will prejudge the merits, if only in part .... It is preferable for the courts to avoid [such a preliminary assessment]; it does not however in itself infringe constitutional rights provided that the other defence rights are respected. Even though in the present case the court ought perhaps not to have anticipated its opinion on the defence of truth when assessing the relevance of the evidence, [ that irregularity ] therefore infringes the constitutional right to use relevant evidence - particularly where as here the decision is taken at a single level of jurisdiction - only if there has been a breach of a substantive right in issue.', '...""', 'Article 161 of the Criminal Code had given rise to criticism among academic writers because it restricted the freedom of expression. In any event, it should be read in conjunction with Article 20 which guaranteed that freedom. In this connection it had to be accepted that criminal legislation could constitute an adequate means of regulating the exercise of fundamental rights provided that it respected the essential content of the right in question. The limits of the freedoms of information and of opinion were beyond question to be found in the area of State security, which could be jeopardised by attempts to discredit democratic institutions. In conclusion the question whether the defence of truth was or was not admissible in this field was purely one of statutory interpretation and the specific application of Article 161 in the case under review was a matter falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.', ""18. On 1 April 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that the term of imprisonment had been definitively served. Subsequently, the record of the conviction was annulled in accordance with Article 118 of the Criminal Code. It could therefore no longer be disclosed by investigation of the applicant's criminal record unless the request came from judges or courts in connection with a new criminal inquiry."", 'B. Relevant legislation', '1. Constitution of 1978', '19. The relevant articles of the Constitution provide as follows:', 'Article 14', '""All Spanish citizens are equal before the law. Any discrimination based on birth, race, sex, religion, opinion or any other condition or personal or social circumstances shall be prohibited.""', 'Article 18', '""1. The right to honour, to a private life and to a family life and the right to control use of one\'s likeness shall be protected.', '...""', 'Article 20', '1. The following rights shall be recognised and protected :', '(a) the right freely to express and disseminate thoughts, ideas and opinions by word of mouth, in writing or by any other means of reproduction;', '...', '(d) the right to receive and communicate true information by any means of dissemination. The right to invoke the conscience clause and that of professional confidentiality shall be governed by statute.', '2. The exercise of these rights may not be restricted by any prior censorship.', '...', '4. These freedoms shall be limited by respect for the rights secured in this Title, by the provisions of the implementing Acts and in particular by the right to honour and to a private life and the right to control use of one\'s likeness and to the protection of youth and children.""', 'Article 23', '""1. Citizens shall have the right to participate in public life directly or through their representatives freely elected at periodically held elections by universal suffrage.', '...""', '2. The Criminal Code', '20. The Institutional Act 8/1983 of 25 June 1983 reformed the Criminal Code. It provides that the offences of insulting the Government shall be punishable by the following penalties:', 'Article 161', '""The following shall be liable to long-term prison sentences [from six years and a day to twelve years - Article 30 of the Criminal Code]:', '1. Those who seriously insult, falsely accuse or threaten ... the Government ...;', '2. ...""', 'Article 162', '""When the insult or threat referred to in the preceding Article is not serious, it shall be punishable by a short- term prison sentence [from six months and a day to six years - Article 30 of the Criminal Code].""', 'These provisions appear in a separate chapter of the Criminal Code. The chapter in question is based on the principle of authority (decision of the Supreme Court of 19 May 1982; see paragraph 12 above) and provides for a strengthened protection for the life, freedom and honour of the senior officials of the State. The offence of falsely accusing the Government was not introduced until 1983.', '21. Title X of Book II of the Criminal Code defines the offences of proffering insults and making false accusations. The latter consists of accusing a person wrongly of an offence coming within the category of those which have to be prosecuted even without a complaint (Article 453 of the Criminal Code). On the other hand, an insult is any expression or action which discredits a person or exposes him to contempt, in particular by accusing him of an offence of the kind which may be prosecuted only if a complaint is laid (Articles 457 and 458 of the Criminal Code). The practical importance of the distinction is that the defence of truth is admissible for the offence of false accusation (Article 456) but not for the offence of proffering insults, except where the insults are directed against civil servants in respect of acts relating to the performance of their duties (Article 461 of the Criminal Code).', 'By the judgment of 31 October 1983 the Supreme Court specified that the defence of truth could not be pleaded in connection with the offence of insulting one of the senior institutions of the State: in the first place no official as such was concerned and, secondly, the institutions in question enjoyed extra protection in this field under the criminal law (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).']","['PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '22. In his application of 17 September 1985 to the Commission (no. 11798/85), Mr Castells relied on Articles 6, 7, 10 and 14 (art. 6, art. 7, art. 10, art. 14) of the Convention.', 'By a partial decision of 9 May 1989, the Commission dismissed the complaints based on Articles 6 and 7 (art. 6, art. 7) as inadmissible. On 7 November 1989 it found the remainder of the application admissible. In its report of 8 January 1991 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (nine votes to three) and that no separate question arose under Article 14 (art. 14) (unanimously). The full text of its opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '23. Mr Castells claimed to be a victim of a violation of his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'The Government contested this assertion, whereas the Commission agreed with it.', ""A. The Government's preliminary objection"", '24. The Government contended, as they had done before the Commission, that the applicant had failed to exhaust his domestic remedies (Article 26 of the Convention) (art. 26). Probably ""for tactical reasons"", he had not specifically raised in the Constitutional Court the complaint concerning the alleged breach of the right to freedom of expression protected under Article 20 of the Constitution. In his amparo appeal he had referred to this provision only indirectly, complaining of discrimination in the exercise of that freedom; in addition, he had made no mention of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention or of similar provisions in other international instruments. According to the Institutional Act governing the amparo appeal procedure (no. 2/1979), he ought to have indicated clearly both the facts and the provisions allegedly infringed. It followed that Mr Castells had not given the Constitutional Court the opportunity to rule on the question which was now before the Court.', '25. In reply the applicant maintained that he had expressly invoked Article 20 of the Constitution in the Constitutional Court. In the first place the facts set out in his amparo application established that what was at stake was a typical example of the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and showed evidently that there had been an interference. Furthermore, in the suplico he had cited, among other provisions, the article in question and in the legal argument he had alleged a violation of Article 20, taken together with Article 14 (equality before the law). It was true that he had argued on the more limited basis of the right of an elected representative to formulate political criticism, under Article 23, but it was sufficient to read point 10 of the ""As to the Law"" part of the judgment of 10 April 1985 to see that the problem had indeed been raised. In that passage the Constitutional Court examined in detail the compatibility of Article 161 of the Criminal Code, the basis for the contested prosecution and conviction, with the freedom of expression (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above).', '26. While expressing its agreement with the applicant, the Commission primarily invited the Court to find that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the objection.', '27. On this point the Court confines itself to referring to its consistent case-law, confirmed most recently in its B. v. France judgment of 25 March 1992 (Series A no. 232-C, p.45, paras. 35-36).', 'As regards the merits of the submission, it observes that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied ""with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism""; it is sufficient that ""the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs"" should have been raised ""at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"" (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72, and the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34).', '28. The applicant relied on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention in two respects: he had, he claimed, been prosecuted and convicted for making statements which were true, but whose accuracy he had been prevented from establishing; in addition, the contested article came within the sphere of the political criticism which it was the duty of any member of parliament to engage in.', '29. It appears that Mr Castells had raised both of these points in the Supreme Court. The judgment of 31 October 1983 refused to admit the defence of truth in relation to the offence of insulting the Government and ruled that the applicant had overstepped the bounds of acceptable political criticism (see paragraph 13 above).', '30. The submissions in support of the amparo appeal of 22 November 1983 made only an indirect and brief reference to Article 20 of the Constitution (see paragraph 15 above); they did however set out the complaints discussed above.', ""While basing his case on a narrower provision, Article 23 of the Constitution, the applicant claimed the right, in his capacity as a senator, to criticise the Government's action, a right which is manifestly inherent in the freedom of expression in the specific case of elected representatives. Moreover the Constitutional Court recognised this in its summary of the complaints; it took together the complaint concerning Articles 14 and 20 and that relating to Article 23 (see paragraph 17 above)."", 'The applicant also invoked both his right to be presumed innocent and his right to adduce evidence capable of establishing the accuracy of his statements. In so doing, he was formulating a complaint which was plainly linked to the alleged violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. Indeed that was how the Constitutional Court construed the complaint; it joined the question of the relevance of the evidence to that of the merits of the case, namely the offence provided for in Article 161 of the Criminal Code, whose compatibility with the freedom of expression it examined (points 9 and 10 of the ""As to the Law"" part of the judgment of 10 April 1985; see paragraph 17 above).', '31. The Court notes finally, like the Commission, that Mr Castells cited Article 20 of the Constitution both in his notice of the amparo appeal, filed in the Supreme Court, and in the suplico of his application of 22 November 1983 (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Subsequently, in a number of written communications to the Constitutional Court, he also referred, in connection with the defence of truth, to his right ""to receive and communicate true information"" (see paragraph 16 above).', 'No doubt the reason why the appeal failed in this respect is to be found in the limits which at the time the Constitutional Court set to its jurisdiction. In its view, the problem of the admissibility of the defence of truth in relation to the offence of insulting the Government raised a question of statutory interpretation rather than an issue of compliance with the Constitution, and the application of Article 161 of the Criminal Code in the case under review was exclusively a matter for the ordinary courts (see paragraph 17 above; and, mutatis mutandis, the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment, cited above, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72).', '32. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant did invoke before the Constitutional Court, ""at least in substance"", the complaints relating to Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. The objection that Mr Castells failed to exhaust domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed.', 'B. Merits of the complaint', ""33. In Mr Castells's submission, the criminal proceedings brought against him, and his subsequent conviction for insulting the Government, interfered with his freedom of expression, in particular because he was not allowed to establish the truth of the statements contained in his article."", '34. The restrictions and penalties of which he complained are undeniably an ""interference"" with the exercise of the freedom in question. For such an interference to avoid infringing Article 10 (art. 10), it must be ""prescribed by law"", carried out in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) and ""necessary in a democratic society"" in order to attain such an aim or aims.', '1. ""Prescribed by law""', '35. There can be no doubt that the contested prosecution had a legal basis, namely Articles 161 and 162 of the Criminal Code. The applicant did not dispute this, but he alleged that he could not have expected that his defence of truth would be held to be inadmissible, in particular following the adoption of the 1978 Constitution. He maintained that, until 19 May 1982, the Supreme Court had never ruled on the question in relation to the offence of insulting the Government and the admissibility of such a defence for offences of this nature (Article 240) was the subject of differing opinions both among academic writers and in the case-law.', ""36. In the Government's contention, on the other hand, it is clear from the Spanish legislation, and in particular from Article 461 of the Criminal Code, that in the field in question the defence of truth is admissible only where the insults are directed against civil servants in the performance of their duties; neither before nor after 1978 had the Supreme Court ever allowed the exceptio veritatis for insults which were not directed against individuals. Mr Castells, however, had accused the Government as a whole."", '37. In the light of the wording of Article 461 of the Criminal Code, the Court considers this interpretation to be reasonable. There was apparently no precedent - hence the hesitation shown by the Supreme Court in its decision of 19 May 1982 (see paragraph 12 above) -, but that is immaterial here: it was a text which covered in a general fashion several possible types of insult and which had inevitably to be capable of being brought into play in new situations; the above-mentioned decision confined itself to applying it to different circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 27-28, para. 53).', 'The Court therefore finds, like the Commission, that the rules governing the contested interference were sufficiently foreseeable for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention.', '2. Was the aim pursued legitimate?', ""38. According to the applicant, neither the charge laid against him nor his subsequent conviction pursued a legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2). The acts of which he was accused, as the Supreme Court itself admitted, had not engendered any alarm (see paragraph 9 above); in addition, it appeared from the judgment of 31 October 1983 that the object of the interference had been not to protect public order and national security, but in fact to preserve the respondent Government's honour."", '39. However, in its decision of 10 April 1985 - on which the Government relied - the Constitutional Court stressed that the security of the State could be threatened by attempts to discredit democratic institutions (see paragraph 17 above). In his article Mr Castells did not merely describe a very serious situation, involving numerous attacks and murders in the Basque Country; he also complained of the inactivity on the part of the authorities, in particular the police, and even their collusion with the guilty parties and inferred therefrom that the Government was responsible.', 'It may therefore be said, and this conforms to the view held by the Government and the Commission, that in the circumstances obtaining in Spain in 1979 the proceedings instituted against the applicant were brought for the ""prevention of disorder"", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), and not only for the ""protection of the reputation ... of others"".', '3. Necessity of the interference', ""40. Mr Castells noted his agreement with the Commission and emphasised the crucial importance of freedom of expression for an elected representative, as the spokesman for the opinions and anxieties of his electorate. In addition, that freedom required extra guarantees when the discussion related to a matter of public interest. This had indeed been the case in this instance; the contested article was part of a wide debate on the climate of insecurity which had prevailed in the Basque Country since 1977. The applicant's conviction had been intended to protect the authorities against the attacks of the opposition rather than the Government against unjustified and defamatory accusations; although embarrassing for the Government, the revelation of the facts in question had served the public interest."", '41. The Government stressed that freedom of expression was not absolute; it carried with it ""duties"" and ""responsibilities"" (Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention) (art. 10-2). Mr Castells had overstepped the normal limits of political debate; he had insulted a democratic government in order to destabilise it, and during a very sensitive, indeed critical, period for Spain, namely shortly after the adoption of the Constitution, at a time when groups of differing political persuasions were resorting to violence concurrently.', '42. The Court recalls that the freedom of expression, enshrined in paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1), constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10(art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"" (see, inter alia, the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, para. 49, and the Observer and Guardian judgment, cited above, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 59 (a)).', 'While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people. He represents his electorate, draws attention to their preoccupations and defends their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament, like the applicant, call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court.', '43. In the case under review Mr Castells did not express his opinion from the senate floor, as he might have done without fear of sanctions, but chose to do so in a periodical. That does not mean, however, that he lost his right to criticise the Government.', 'In this respect, the pre-eminent role of the press in a State governed by the rule of law must not be forgotten. Although it must not overstep various bounds set, inter alia, for the prevention of disorder and the protection of the reputation of others, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 40, para. 65, and the Observer and Guardian judgment, cited above, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 59 (b)).', 'Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders. In particular, it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, para. 42).', '44. In its judgment of 31 October 1983, the Supreme Court took the view that the contested article had crossed over the line between political criticism and insult, albeit only slightly, by its use of certain terms (see paragraph 13 above).', '45. The Court observes, like the Commission, that Mr Castells began by denouncing the impunity enjoyed by the members of various extremist groups, the perpetrators of numerous attacks in the Basque Country since 1977. He thereby recounted facts of great interest to the public opinion of this region, where the majority of the copies of the periodical in question were sold. In his conclusion, however, he levelled serious accusations against the Government, which in his view was responsible for the situation which had arisen (see paragraph 7 above).', '46. The freedom of political debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature. A Contracting State may make it subject to certain ""restrictions"" or ""penalties"", but it is for the Court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian judgment, cited above, Series A no. 216, para. 59 (c)).', 'The limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the Government than in relation to a private citizen, or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the Government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of the press and public opinion. Furthermore, the dominant position which the Government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries or the media. Nevertheless it remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to defamatory accusations devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith.', '47. In this instance, Mr Castells offered on several occasions, before the Supreme Court and subsequently in the Constitutional Court, to establish that the facts recounted by him were true and well known; in his view, this deprived his statements of any insulting effect (see paragraphs 11 and 16 above).', 'On 19 May 1982 the Supreme Court declared such evidence inadmissible on the ground that the defence of truth could not be pleaded in respect of insults directed at the institutions of the nation (see paragraphs 12 and 21 above); it confirmed this interpretation in its judgment of 31 October 1983 (see paragraph 13 above). The Constitutional Court took the view that it was a question of ordinary statutory interpretation and as such fell outside its jurisdiction (see paragraph 17 above).', 'The applicant could not therefore, in the criminal proceedings brought against him under Article 161 of the Criminal Code, plead the defences of truth and good faith.', ""48. In the Government's contention, because Mr Castells's allegations were not sufficiently precise, their truth could not be demonstrated; in addition, they were to be regarded as value judgments, in relation to which the defence of truth was irrelevant."", 'This argument is not convincing. The article which appeared in Punto y Hora de Euskalherria (see paragraph 7 above) must be considered as a whole. The applicant began by drawing up a long list of murders and attacks perpetrated in the Basque Country, then stressed that they had remained unpunished; he continued by alleging the involvement of various extremist organisations, which he named, and finally attributed to the Government the responsibility for the situation. In fact many of these assertions were susceptible to an attempt to establish their truth, just as Mr Castells could reasonably have tried to demonstrate his good faith.', ""It is impossible to state what the outcome of the proceedings would have been had the Supreme Court admitted the evidence which the applicant sought to adduce; but the Court attaches decisive importance to the fact that it declared such evidence inadmissible for the offence in question (see paragraph 12 above). It considers that such an interference in the exercise of the applicant's freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society."", '49. The Government also relied on the relatively lenient nature of the sanction imposed, but in the light of the foregoing conclusion the Court does not have to examine this argument.', '50. In sum, there has been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10 (art. 14+10)', '51. Mr Castells also claimed to be the victim of discrimination because other persons had expressed similar views without any criminal sanctions being imposed on them. He relied on Article 14 (art. 14), which is worded as follows:', '""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.""', 'The Government denied this assertion.', '52. As this question is not a fundamental aspect of the case, the Court does not consider it necessary to deal with it separately (see, inter alia, the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 16, para. 30).', 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '53. According to Article 50 (art. 50):', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', ""54. The applicant sought in the first place the publication of a summary of the Court's judgment in the newspapers of the Basque Country, of Madrid and the rest of the State, and the removal of any reference to his conviction in the central criminal records (Registro Central de Penados y Rebeldes)."", 'The Court points out that it does not have jurisdiction to make such orders (see, mutatis mutandis, the Manifattura FL v. Italy judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no. 230-B, p. 21, para. 22).', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '55. Mr Castells also claimed 375,000 pesetas in respect of loss of earnings. As an accused on bail, he had to appear fifty- two times before the court of his place of residence (San Sebastián) and three times before the Supreme Court of Madrid (see paragraphs 8-9 above), which resulted in a loss of time and opportunity in the exercise of his professional activity as a lawyer.', 'The Court takes the view that this constraint can have caused him hardly any loss since, as a lawyer, he frequently attended the courts in question. That he sustained pecuniary damage is therefore not established.', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '56. The applicant also claimed, without giving any figures, compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The Court does not rule out the possibility that he may have sustained such damage, but in the circumstances of the case the finding of a violation set out in the present judgment constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '57. In respect of his costs and expenses incurred in the Spanish courts, Mr Castells claimed 2,181,476 pesetas. The Court awards him only 1,000,000 of this amount, since some of the sums in question related to amparo appeals unconnected with the complaints found admissible by the Commission.', '58. Finally the applicant sought 3,328,000 pesetas for his costs and expenses before the Convention organs, together with 20,000 DM for the fees of Mr Korff and Mr Vervaele.', 'Like the Government, the Court considers excessive the number of lawyers representing Mr Castells, who appeared before it with four lawyers; it should also be borne in mind that the Commission declared inadmissible some of the complaints raised initially.', 'Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards Mr Castells an overall amount of 2,000,000 pesetas.']",2,es,001-57772,1

Mr Thorgeir Thorgeirson is an Icelandic citizen. He is a writer and resides in Reykjavik, Iceland.', '8. From 1979 to 1983 a number of incidents occurred in Iceland involving allegations of police brutality, about ten of which were reported to the police. The last such complaint was made in the autumn of 1983 by a journalist, Mr Skafti Jónsson, and it led to the prosecution of three members of the Reykjavik police, of whom two were acquitted and one convicted. His case received extensive coverage by the press and gave rise to considerable discussion on the relations between the public and the police. This caused the applicant to publish two articles on police brutality in the daily newspaper Morgunbladid on 7 and 20 December 1983 respectively.', '9. The first article read as follows (translation):', '""LET US CONSIDER NOW!', 'An open letter to the Minister of Justice Jón Helgason', 'Honourable Minister of Justice:', '(1) Recently a problem which has been bothering - if not obsessing - me for several years has suddenly been highlighted by the press. One of the journalists of your very own progressive party-newspaper - Tíminn [The Time] - had a painful experience and returned with some injuries from the Reykjavik night-life jungle. Often the perils of the jungle and other such inhospitable regions can help us to visualise the hardships that missionaries such as Stanley and Livingstone had to endure, even if they were preaching the worth of God ’ s own Kingdom rather than the co-operative Utopia.', '(2) In this case trouble befell one of your political missionaries, the journalist Skafti, in the town ’ s night-life. The photographs of his facial injuries, spread across four newspaper columns, have, of course, shocked us.', '(3) We do not want to accept that our policemen have damaged this journalist ’ s handsome face in this way. All he was doing, he tells us, was innocently looking for his overcoat when the beasts in uniform in the aforementioned jungle attacked him.', '(4) In my opinion Skafti ’ s case is of little importance. But as it has received a lot of attention and been widely discussed, I would like to use the opportunity to point out to you that the real problem is in fact bigger and much more horrifying.', '(5) Skafti ’ s case, brought to our attention by the press, is but the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it, in the dark sea of silence, lurks a problem nine times bigger.', '(6) That is the part I would like to bring to your attention, because you are the Minister of Justice and thus in command of those wild beasts in uniform that creep around, silently or not, in the jungle of our town ’ s night-life.', '(7) I am certainly not underestimating the pain and hardship that this young man has unnecessarily had to endure. However, Skafti is obviously going to recover. The blue spots on his face will turn violet, then brown and in time they will eventually disappear. He will go back to working for [The Time] and his case will be buried under the mounds of day to day scandals which will pile up like snow after a heavy snowstorm.', 'That is if we do not use this opportunity to look at the problem in its entirety.', '(8) Several years ago I had to spend several weeks on a ward in our local hospital. In a room leading off the same corridor was a man in his twenties lying in his bed. He was a promising and charming young person, but he was paralysed to the extent that he could not move any part of his body, other than his eyes. He was able to read with the aid of special machinery and a helping hand to turn the pages for him.', 'I was told that his chance of recovery was minimal.', '(9) The young man ’ s room-mates told me that his injuries had been inflicted by bouncers of a restaurant and some policemen. At first I could not believe this, so I enquired among the hospital staff and - Yes, they were right; we had there a victim of the Reykjavik night-squad.', '(10) The image of this paralysed youngster somehow followed me out of the hospital and I couldn ’ t help talking about his case. I then found out that most people had various stories of persons who had had a similar or even worse experiences with the beasts in uniform. Individuals reduced to a mental age of a new-born child as a result of strangle-holds that policemen and bouncers learn and use with brutal spontaneity instead of handling people with prudence and care. There are so many such stories, identical in substance, that you can hardly dismiss them merely as lies any more. Another thing that goes with those stories as inevitably as brutality follows stupidity is the statement that suing a policeman in such a case would be hopeless. The investigation would be undertaken by another department of the police and there be carried out by an élite group who see it as their duty to wash all policemen clean of any accusations made against them.', '(11) The victims of the police brutes remain forgotten, without hope, as the years pass without their causes ever being seriously discussed.', '(12) Now this might be one of those rare occasions. It is the reason for this letter of mine.', '(13) I have little doubt that there is something essentially wrong in a system where the people in charge seem to disregard all sense of justice and misinterpret their duties by allowing brutes and sadists to act out their perversions - no matter who is the victim. In my opinion the Reykjavik Chief of Police is being stubborn in refusing to relieve the accused policemen from their duties while the ‘ Jónsson case ’ is being investigated. Moreover, he seems to lose little of his self-confidence, even though he is up against one of your own partisans in this case. But we shall see.', '(14) Even if Mr Jónsson wins his case this will be an exception and will change nothing. Other victims of this brutality will continue to pile up in silence as before.', '(15) My opinion is that the real problem lies with a system where policemen investigate other policemen ’ s violations of correct professional conduct. This opinion I share with other much more competent persons - who are obviously hesitant in pronouncing their opinion on this matter fearing the reprisals and beatings that might follow.', 'The matter is as serious as that.', '(16) Two of your predecessors in the office of Minister of Justice have received letters from me regarding these problems. Neither of them had the courtesy to answer.', '(17) Recently I have been looking at pictures of you in the paper and I was struck by your facial appearance of fairness and youthfulness mixed with confidence. This indeed is the very kind of facial expression that could at any time easily seep into your character even if it was originally only meant for the photographer.', 'Therefore I am writing to you as well.', 'My proposal is the same as it was before:', '(18) Stop putting these cases of police brutality into this perfunctory, useless automatic washing-machine. As long as policemen are allowed to clean one another you will never even have the possibility to consider the urgent things such as giving IQ and character tests which must be passed before they are taught how to exercise fatal tricks on people, to make them responsible in cases where they have momentarily lost control of their temper - all of which is needed in order to have a competent police force worthy of the power given to them.', 'But how can we get rid of the old system?', '(19) You have to form a committee of trustworthy people to investigate the rumours, gradually becoming public opinion, that there is more and more brutality within the Reykjavik police force and being hushed up in an unnatural manner. Such a committee could ask victims of police brutality to come forward with their statements for eventual verification. Hopefully the committee will find that it is only a tiny minority of policemen who are responsible. Those individuals should be advised to look for other jobs.', '(20) I have the gut feeling that our Police Problem could be compared with the so-called Youth Problem in the sense that comparatively few individuals are responsible for this negative public opinion of them. Furthermore, those individuals could not be said to be typical of either group - nor the most intelligent.', '(21) I have seen the policemen in this town perform many a good deed and therein I have met many an exemplary fellow. We cannot do without them. But I feel I owe it to the young man I met at the local hospital to muster my courage and put forward this proposal: let us try cleaning up this mess so that those who, ready to risk their lives, embark on the adventure of the jungle of the Reykjavik night-life in the future can at least be assured that a policeman in uniform is not among the perils therein.', 'There are enough other wild beasts.', '(22) In court you sometimes put forward an alternative claim in case your main request is not accepted. Should you, Jón Helgason, fail to ensure that this neutral investigation is carried out, I call upon able journalists ( Skafti for example) to start this investigation and to publish the results in a book that would very probably become a bestseller. I would at any time be prepared to participate in this.', 'With all my respect and best wishes,', 'Yours sincerely,', 'Thorgeir Thorgeirson""', '10. Extracts from the second article read as follows:', '""STRIKE WHILE THE FLY IS SITTING ON MY NOSE ...', '(1) Thorgeir Thorgeirson ’ s statement on the policeman Einar Bjarnason ’ s behaviour in a television programme on December the 13th, in the evening.', '...', '(2) Last Tuesday, December the 13th, there was a programme about the police problem on television. Among the participants were two police intellectuals who were given free rein, according to the opinion of many spectators. The only spectator whom I heard excusing Bjarki and Einar argued that there had only been two of them and the third one was regrettably missing from their camp, that is to say the supervisor.', 'This might well be true.', '(3) Towards the end of the programme Einar, who happens to be the Chairman of the Reykjavik Police Association, organised an amusing occasion: after having consulted Bjarki with much paper crackling and whispering, he started reading from a typed document containing filth about me, the undersigned, a liar and unreliable person (according to this document which the police somehow had managed to have signed by a person who had nothing to do with it).', '(4) Einar could easily have got his message across without breaking the law on radio-broadcasting and thus risking both his honour and his job. Many spectators were astounded by the man ’ s behaviour.', 'Not surprisingly.', '(5) This venture can hardly be explained merely by loss of control, so I feel forced to add another article to what I had thought to be my final word about the matter a week ago (this is written Thursday the 15th of December and will be delivered to the newspaper on Friday the 16th of December).', 'I have to mention my experience over the last week.', '(6) Last Wednesday, i.e. December the 7th, Morgunbladid published my letter to the highest official in the Icelandic judicial world. My request was that he immediately order a neutral investigation of the police problem instead of allowing the problem to control itself forever. Naturally I did not expect my text to be well received at the local police stations.', '(7) A certain misunderstanding is always inevitable. Misconception surrounding this matter has bloomed; my ideas of a writer ’ s duty are that he should, at least sometimes, be the local conscience, but our police officers seem to be of a totally different opinion, as is only to be expected.', 'No harm in that.', '(8) The morning my letter to Minister Jón Helgason appeared in the newspaper, astonishingly many people phoned me. Among them was Gudmundur Hermannsson who introduced himself as the Chief Police Constable ( yfirlögreglubjónn ) of Reykjavik. He wanted to know what case I had been writing about in my article. I told him that the subject had been the situation in general; not an isolated case. There were at least several hundred cases concerned. Gudmundur then asked what the paralysed youngster at the local hospital was called, the one I had mentioned. I told him, which was true, that I had probably never heard the boy ’ s name. Then I asked Gudmundur if the police were currently investigating the matter. His answer was yes. I then pointed out to him that it would be a very bold thing to do in the circumstances: if the police were once again policing themselves. At the same time I refused to say anything else on the telephone, except I told him the date of my hospitalisation. We bade farewell.', '...', '(9) Time passed until Sunday. The newspapers were full of sobbing statements made by policemen. Sunday ’ s Morgunbladid published an article by a policeman, Jóhannes Jónsson, who referred to Friday the 9th ’ s news item which meant that his manuscript would have reached the editorial office on Saturday. This seemed strange to me, knowing that the normal waiting time to have an article published in Morgunbladid is something like four to six days from the date when the manuscript is handed in to the date of publication. That is when ordinary citizens like us are involved. In his article the policeman also reiterated the ‘ police-truth ’ that the case Thorgeir ‘ meant to refer to ’ was to be found in a news item on page 13 of Friday ’ s Morgunbladid.', '...', '(10) Since then something has occurred, and now I must ask Hall to keep his promise and publish this statement of mine. Even though Einar ’ s blow towards the end of the television programme last Tuesday proved to be so much askew that it missed and I am not the one hurt by it, I must point out how very typical of the police his behaviour has been.', '(11) What is at the root of this so-called Police Problem? Well - many people think that our policemen have already attacked too many a citizen, guilty or innocent. They have been lashing out far too frequently.', '(12) The police reactions which have recently appeared in the press show that they are quite familiar with Jon Thoroddsen ’ s novels - the person who gossips and spreads rumours appears frequently therein. They might also have been reading the Saga of Grettir the Strong whose principle was: you cure ills by pointing to worse.', 'Anyway that seems to be the line they have taken.', '(13) This principle is far too pathetic for a whole police force to follow if we really want people to appreciate their services.', '(14) Since Tuesday many people have telephoned me and expressed the opinion that the policemen ’ s show on television was a disastrous exhibition of national characteristics for our children to see.', '(15) - They should have been in uniform, someone said. Their behaviour was so typical of what is gradually becoming the public image of our police force defending itself: bullying, forgery, unlawful actions, superstitions, rashness and ineptitude.', 'In just those words.', '(16) The title of this article is taken from the folk tale that everyone should know, about the couple hunting the fly. I thought of it as I was observing the detective sergeant fighting the bee in his bonnet during the television programme. Should our Minister of Justice not have had time to see the programme, I would like to suggest that he borrow the tape which can still be found at the television station - that is if he wants to see a near-perfect illustration of what the general public are more and more referring to as the Police Problem.', '(17) The programme should be an example to us of the necessity of an impartial examination of the problem to prevent the police from repeatedly hurting themselves while ""investigating"" matters which touch their self- esteem and childish pride.', '(18) Let us stop these fights and consider the proposal I put forward in my letter to the Minister of Justice. We could even consider an idea suggested by a witty friend of mine:', '(19) - Thorgeir, he said. Wouldn ’ t it be an idea to get a really good child psychologist to study these police fights?', 'Hopefully the matter is not all that complicated.', 'With thanks for the publication.', 'Thorgeir Thorgeirson""', '11. In response to these articles, the Ministry of Justice sent the applicant a letter dated 9 January 1984. It informed him that the problems raised in the articles were being reviewed at various levels and that the matter was on the agenda of the Parliament ( Althing ) so that the Minister of Justice could report to it in the near future on the studies and proposals which had been made in this field.', 'B. Investigation and defamation proceedings', '12. By letter of 27 December 1983, the Reykjavik Police Association had asked the public prosecutor to investigate the aforementioned allegations. Accordingly, he sent the case to the State Criminal Investigation Police (""SCIP"") on 21 May 1984 to examine whether the publications constituted defamation within the meaning of Article 108 of the General Penal Code of 1940 (Law no. 19/1940 - ""the Penal Code""). On 18 June the SCIP interrogated the applicant, who was assisted by his lawyer.', '13. As a result, on 13 August 1985 the public prosecutor issued a bill of indictment charging the applicant with defamation of unspecified members of the Reykjavik police, contrary to Article 108 of the Penal Code.', '14. The following passages of the first article were considered to be defamatory:', '""beasts in uniform"" (paragraph 9(3) above);', '""of those wild beasts in uniform"" (paragraph 9(6) above);', '""The young man ’ s room-mates told me that his injuries had been inflicted by bouncers of a restaurant and some policemen. At first I could not believe this, so I enquired among the hospital staff and - Yes, they were right; we had there a victim of the Reykjavik night- squad"" (paragraph 9(9) above);', '""I then found out that most people had various stories of persons who had had a similar or even worse experiences with the beasts in uniform.

There are so many such stories, identical in substance, that you can hardly dismiss them merely as lies any more"" (paragraph 9(10) above);', '""victims of the police brutes"" (paragraph 9(11) above);', '""allowing brutes and sadists to act out their perversions"" (paragraph 9(13) above).', '15. The second article was also considered to contain a defamatory statement:', '""Their behaviour was so typical of what is gradually becoming the public image of our police force defending itself: bullying, forgery, unlawful actions, superstitions, rashness and ineptitude"" (paragraph 10(15) above).', '16. On 9 September 1985 the indictment was served on the applicant; it summoned him to appear at a sitting on the following day of a chamber of the Reykjavik Criminal Court, of which Judge Pétur Gudgeirsson was the only member. At the applicant ’ s request, the arraignment was adjourned until 17 September.On that day the court held a sitting at which he appeared, accompanied by Mr Tómas Gunnarsson, a Supreme Court lawyer; the public prosecutor was not present. The sitting proceeded as follows:', '(a) As required by the second paragraph of Article 77 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 74/1974), the judge informed the defendant that he was being questioned as he was suspected of having committed an offence.', '(b) Mr Tómas Gunnarsson was appointed as the applicant ’ s defence counsel. All the case documents were handed to them.', '(c) The applicant was asked by the judge whether he had written the two newspaper articles. He replied that he had, but pointed out that the passages quoted in the indictment, while correct, had been removed from their context.', '(d) The judge confronted the applicant with a record of his statement to the SCIP on 18 June 1984 and with his letter to them of 19 June. The applicant confirmed the accuracy of the record and that he had written the letter.', '(e) When asked by the judge whether he could substantiate the relevant passages in his articles, the applicant maintained that, in their context in the indictment - on which he had already commented -, he was neither able nor obliged to do so; this was not his literary product, but the product of the accuser.', '(f) The applicant asked to be given time in which to acquaint himself with the case documents and to prepare his comments. Another sitting was scheduled for 24 September 1985.', '17. On that date the applicant and his counsel appeared before the court, again in the absence of the prosecution. Counsel submitted a motion that Judge Pétur Gudgeirsson should withdraw, on the ground that, in addition to acting as judge, he had represented the prosecution because of its absence at this and the previous sittings.', '18. On 25 September 1985 the judge decided as follows:', '""This case does not warrant [an adversarial procedure] according to Article 130 of the Code of Criminal Procedure .... [The applicant ’ s] motion that the judge yield his seat is unsupported by any valid arguments and totally unfounded. The judge is neither obliged nor allowed to yield his seat.""', '19. On 26 September 1985 the prosecution, pursuant to Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, refused the applicant ’ s request for leave to file an appeal by way of a summary procedure against that decision with the Supreme Court. He subsequently asked the Ministry of Justice to appoint an ad hoc prosecutor to consider whether leave should be granted, but this request was refused on 18 October.', '20. During the period from 9 October 1985 until 28 April 1986, the Criminal Court held six more sittings at which the applicant and his counsel were present. Documents were submitted, oral statements made and witnesses heard. The public prosecutor appeared at each of these sittings, except that on 17 February 1986, when a video-taped television programme was shown to the court.', '21. At a sitting held on 25 October 1985, Judge Pétur Gudgeirsson showed the applicant photographs of a person and asked him whether this was the young man at the local hospital, described in the first article (see paragraph 9(8) above). The applicant replied as follows:', '""... it is astounding for an experienced adult to hear another experienced adult ask a question like that. I see and study between one and two hundred persons daily. This would correspond to the entire population of Iceland in about 7 years. Therefore an individual whom I see less than 50 times does not stick in my mind unless there are some special reasons to the contrary. Therefore it is outright absurd and against the nature of the human mind, to ask a person whether he recognises an individual whom he might conceivably have seen seven years ago. I can, however, answer that this is not the young man I had in mind when I wrote the article ‘ Let Us Consider Now! ’ ...""', '22. During a sitting held on 28 April 1986 the parties agreed that further investigation by the court was not required. Accordingly, counsel was given until 3 June 1986 to submit the applicant ’ s written defence; the prosecutor declared that he would make no further observations.', '23. In his defence, which was filed on 3 June 1986, the applicant resuscitated the claim (see paragraphs 17-19 above) that the case should be dismissed or the defendant acquitted on account of the prosecutor ’ s absence at certain sittings of the trial. With regard to the merits of the case, he claimed, inter alia, the following:', '""It is of course the general public that is assaulted by policemen .... Such an experience is quite memorable and, in the normal course of things, one person tells another. In the process descriptions frequently become exaggerated. As the instances increase in number a public opinion is formed, which naturally is even rougher at the edges than the problem itself. To a significant extent, I used this public opinion as a main feature of my article ‘ Let Us Consider Now! ’. Public opinion is, of course, in itself a fact and its origins are generally less important and less open to dispute ...', 'If public opinion turns sour, confidence in policemen is lost, also in policemen who have never as much as hurt a fly. In the autumn of 1983 this loss of confidence had assumed proportions outright dangerous to public welfare. So, when the case of Skafti Jónsson emerged, I became aware of this danger. And my ... article published in Morgunbladid on 7 December 1983 was my reaction to this dangerous situation. By writing the article I consider that I was performing the duty of an honourable writer who studies the spirit of the nation and reports his findings without hiding the truth. This is clear to any person who is willing to read the article in its entirety and puts his mind to really understanding what is written there.', '...', 'But the main purpose of the article, and its conclusion, was to request the Minister to have an investigation carried out as to whether public opinion was correct or incorrect. The article was intended to raise a lawful, urgent question.', 'Even though my intention was to write an article completely within the limits of the law, I shall not hide the fact that I also tried to phrase the text in such a way as to elicit answers from the parties concerned. The question, of course, was about the truthfulness of the menacing public opinion. If this was incorrect, the police authorities (which alone may possess comprehensive knowledge of these matters) could be expected to react in the composed, confident and calm manner of respectable, honest souls. The Board of the Police Association and the Chief of Police would simply have recommended to the Minister that he initiate at the earliest opportunity an impartial investigation of the matter asked for. Such a reaction would also have calmed the public considerably, as it would have borne witness to good faith.""', '24. On 16 June 1986, at a sitting attended by the applicant, judgment was delivered by Judge Pétur Gudgeirsson who rejected the claim based on the prosecutor ’ s absence at certain sittings. As to the merits he stated inter alia:', '""According to the evidence submitted, the defendant underwent treatment at the Reykjavik City Hospital from 19 June to 11 July 1978. At the same time a patient named Trausti Ellidason ... was staying there, [completely] paralysed following a physical assault by an acquaintance of his .... The defendant has been shown photographs of Trausti Ellidason taken at the City Hospital the day after the assault. The defendant has stated that Trausti Ellidason is not the man he describes in his ... article in the Morgunbladid; ...', 'A video-tape recording of the television programme ‘ Varied Opinions ’, broadcast on 13 December 1983, has been submitted in evidence.', '...', 'Matters relating to law enforcement, the relations between the public and the police, as well as the ‘ Skafti case ’ ... were discussed. At the end of the programme Mr Einar Bjarnason, Police Sergeant and Chairman of the Reykjavik Police Association, pointed out that ... the defendant ’ s article could be shown to be unfounded, as he had ... a statement from the young man of whom the defendant had written in the Morgunbladid. The sergeant read out [the statement]. [It] reads, inter alia ‘ What Thorgeir Thorgeirson says about my case in his article is wrong from beginning to end. ’ Having investigated the matter, [Mr Bjarnason] and Police Constable Bjarki Elíasson considered that the statement had been made by the person about whom the defendant had written.', 'As requested by the defendant ’ s counsel ..., [Mr] Einar Bjarnason was called to testify. He said that the statement had been made by a young disabled man, called Trausti Ellidason, ... that he had obtained information as to the time when the defendant and Trausti Ellidason were in hospital, and that it had been assumed that the defendant had been referring to Trausti Ellidason in his article. That was how they had obtained his statement. Furthermore, the witness stated that, to his knowledge, no Reykjavik policeman had ever caused anyone injuries while on duty such as those described by the defendant in his article of 7 December 1983.', '...', 'The defence ... submitted that in writing the two articles the defendant was performing a writer ’ s duty to society by drawing attention to people ’ s physical injuries that have been caused by the police, bringing such matters to light and requesting official action to prevent this. [This alone would get] little attention unless published in the media, and even then it would frequently go unnoticed. Harsh words and stylistic artifices also seemed necessary, as writers so well know. The defendant had been earning his living as a writer for many years, and public authorities had recognised his work, inter alia, by paying him a salary. His work fell within the scope of protection offered by Article 72 of the Constitution, which forbids censorship and other limitations on the freedom of the press.', 'However the said constitutional rule goes on to provide that a person may be held responsible for printed statements, a principle which has never been disputed in Icelandic law. There are various statutory provisions making it a punishable offence to express certain thoughts or statements in public, such as in print. In addition to Article 108 of the ... Penal Code, reference may be made in this regard to Articles 88, 95, 121, 125, 210, 229, and 233(a)-237 of the same Code. The defendant cannot be deemed to enjoy any privileges or greater freedom of expression than others owing to the fact that he is a writer.', 'The defendant ’ s newspaper articles were published in his name, and he has acknowledged having been their author. The defendant was resident in Iceland when the articles were published in the Morgunbladid. Pursuant to Article 15 of the Right of Publications Act 1956 ... he thus incurs both criminal liability and liability for damages on account of the contents ... thereof.', 'The statements founding the charges in the indictment were said to be directed against unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force.', 'Notwithstanding that the wording of Article 108 of the ... Penal Code covers offences against specific ... civil servants, [this provision] also covers offences against a defined group of civil servants (see the judgment in the Supreme Court Reports, volume LIV, p. 57).', 'The words ‘ beasts in uniform ’ and ‘ of those wild beasts in uniform ’ are, in the context in which they were published, held to amount to vituperation against and insults to unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force. These statements are punishable according to Article 108 of the ... Penal Code.', 'In the indictment these statements are considered to be defamatory allegations. Having regard to the third paragraph of Article 118 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ..., the defendant can nevertheless be held responsible for their publication; his actions have been correctly reported and he cannot be held to have been prejudiced in the preparation of his defence case.', 'The passages ‘ The young man ’ s room-mates ... Reykjavik night-squad ’ and ‘ Then I found out ... lies any more ’ and the words ‘ victims of the police brutes ’ are, both in themselves and in the context of the ... newspaper article ..., deemed to constitute allegations against unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force of committing many serious acts of physical assault on people who have become disabled as a result. This falls under Article 218 ... of the ... Penal Code, a violation of which may carry the punishment of many years ’ imprisonment.', 'The defendant ’ s allegations have not been justified, and [due to their] publication ... he is liable to punishment according to Article 108 of the ... Penal Code.', 'The expressions ‘ beasts in uniform ’ and ‘ police brutes ’ must also be deemed to constitute insults to and vituperation against unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force.', 'These statements are in the indictment said to be defamatory, but ... the defendant can nevertheless be held responsible for them under Article 108 of the ... Penal Code.', 'The words ‘ allowing brutes and sadists to act out their perversions ’ are, in the context of the said article, held to constitute vituperations against and insults to unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force.', 'The indictment states that these are defamatory, but ... the defendant can nevertheless be held responsible for them under Article 108 ...', 'The passage ‘ Their behaviour was so typical of what is gradually becoming the public image of our police force defending itself: bullying, forgery, unlawful actions, superstitions, rashness and ineptitude ’ has not been justified. With the exception of the words ‘ superstitions, rashness and ineptitude ’ the passage accuses unspecified members of the Reykjavik police of forgery and other ... criminal offences. This falls under the provisions of Chapters XIV and XVII of the ... Penal Code, a violation of which may entail a heavy prison sentence.', 'By making these statements the defendant has become liable to punishment according to Article 108 ...', 'The words ‘ superstitions, rashness and ineptitude ’ are, on the other hand, deemed to fall within the limits of permissible criticism, and the defendant is therefore not liable for them ...""', '25. The applicant was sentenced to pay a fine of 10,000 Icelandic crowns to the State Treasury or, in default of payment within four weeks from service of the judgment, to eight days ’ imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay all the costs of the case, including his counsel ’ s fees.', '26. Both the applicant and the prosecutor appealed to the Supreme Court of Iceland, which heard the case on 22 September 1987. Counsel for the applicant requested that not only the Criminal Court ’ s judgment but also the entire proceedings, starting with the issue of the indictment, be annulled and that the case be referred back to the Criminal Court for adjudication. In the alternative, he sought his client ’ s acquittal on all charges. The prosecutor asked for aggravation of the penalty.', '27. In its judgment of 20 October 1987, the Supreme Court held inter alia:', '""... the request to annul the proceedings is based on the same arguments as those presented to the Criminal Court on 24 September 1985, when the defendant ’ s lawyer made the following statement:', '‘ ... no representative of the prosecution was present at ... any former sittings in this case ... In view of Articles 20(1) and 36(1)(1) [of the Code of Criminal Procedure], the defendant considers the fact that one person performed both the role of judge and prosecutor in the same case to be unlawful. Having regard to the judge ’ s lack of initiative in rectifying this state of affairs, [his] replacement ... is required. ’', 'The Criminal Court judge dismissed this request and the public prosecutor refused to authorise an appeal therefrom by way of a summary procedure to the Supreme Court .... No evidence has been produced during the proceedings in this non-prosecuted case, so classified in accordance with Article 130 of the aforementioned code, to justify a disqualification of the judge or quashing the [conviction] ...', 'The Criminal Court ’ s finding of the defendant ’ s guilt and its application of the penal law ... are upheld as well as the punishment imposed .... The Criminal Court ’ s decision on the costs of the case shall remain unaltered.""', '28. In a dissenting opinion one member of the Court held as follows:', '""In a criminal action in respect of defamatory statements it is necessary to clearly define those to whom the statements are considered damaging. This is required both for the defence case and in order to resolve the difficult question of necessary limitations on discussion of matters of public concern.', 'The indictment states ... that the action is brought ‘ on account of defamatory allegations against policemen ’ and ... that the allegations in question are directed ‘ against unspecified members of the Reykjavik police force ’. The indictment must thus be understood as relating to an offence directed against policemen in Reykjavik generally. While agreeing that the statements quoted in the indictment are harsh and have, as such, not been justified, I consider, by reference to the above-mentioned way in which the case has been set out in the indictment, that the conditions for punishment by reason of a violation of Article 108 ..., which is to be construed in the light of the fundamental principle of Icelandic constitutional law relating to freedom of expression in speech and writing, have not been fulfilled.', 'In view of the above I consider that the defendant should be acquitted and that all costs of the proceedings in the [Criminal] Court as well as in the Supreme Court should be paid by the State Treasury; these are to include the fees of the defendant ’ s appointed counsel before the Supreme Court.""']","['II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. Freedom of expression and defamation of civil servants', '29. Article 72 of the Constitution of 17 June 1944 of the Republic of Iceland reads:', '""Every person has the right to express his thoughts in print. However, he may be held responsible for them in court. Censorship or other limitations on the freedom of the press may never be imposed.""', 'The responsibility referred to in this provision is further defined by statute.', '30. An author may, according to Article 15 of the Right of Publication Act 1956 (Law no. 57/1956), be held both criminally and civilly liable for publications made in his own name, if he is domiciled in Iceland at the time of publication or if he is within the jurisdiction of the Icelandic courts when an action is brought against him. If the publication is not made in his name, it is the publisher, editor, seller, distributor or printer who may incur such liability.', '31. A defamatory publication constitutes a criminal offence under the Penal Code. Article 108 deals specifically with the defamation of civil servants, in the following terms:', '""Whoever vituperates or otherwise insults a civil servant in words or actions or makes defamatory allegations against or about him when he is discharging his duty, or on account of the discharge of his duty, shall be fined, detained or imprisoned for up to three years. An allegation, even if proven, may warrant a fine if made in an impudent manner.""', '32. In the applicant ’ s case both the Criminal Court and a majority of the Supreme Court interpreted Article 108 as including defamatory statements directed not only against specific civil servants, but also against a limited group of unspecified civil servants. Precedents to support this interpretation may be found in two Supreme Court judgments: The Public Prosecutor v. Jónas Kristjánsson, 19 January 1983, and The Public Prosecutor v. Agnar Bogason, 31 October 1952.', 'B. Criminal procedure', '33. Article 20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure vests authority to prosecute in the Public Prosecutor, who is assisted by the Assistant Public Prosecutor as well as several prosecutors and deputies. He decides how the investigation in criminal cases is to be conducted and supervises it (Article 21).', '34. Under Article 115, the Public Prosecutor may initiate criminal proceedings by issuing an indictment against the accused. This must clearly specify, inter alia, the court in which the case is to be filed, the name of the defendant, the alleged offence and the potential penalty. The indictment is then transmitted, together with the case-file, to the appropriate court. The judge to whom the case is assigned notes on the indictment, which is subsequently served on the defendant, the time when the case will be formally opened.', '35. The case is, according to Article 121, formally opened at a court sitting during which the Criminal Court makes the indictment and other documents available to the defendant. If the defendant makes a clear confession at this stage, the case will be adjudicated there and then. Otherwise, he must be given the opportunity to adduce evidence and present a defence, in writing or orally, with the assistance of counsel if appointed.', '36. It is for the Public Prosecutor to determine whether the case warrants an adversarial procedure as set out in Articles 131 to 136. If so, the prosecution will appear before the Criminal Court judge. According to Article 130 such a procedure is to be followed if:', '(a) the offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than eight years;', '(b) the offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than five years and the issues of law or of fact involved require such a procedure; or', '(c) the case concerns matters of special significance or the outcome of the case is otherwise of great public importance.', 'If the adversarial procedure is not followed, the conduct of the case is governed by Articles 123 to 129. The defendant presents his case before the judge in the absence of the prosecution, unless the Public Prosecutor decides otherwise.', '37. When the prosecution does not appear the judge must, in accordane with the general rule contained in Article 75, investigate ex officio and independently, all the facts of and issues in the case, even if the prosecution has already investigated them and prepared reports thereon. The judge must also consider all factors relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused and all mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Once the investigation is completed and the defendant, or his counsel, has submitted his evidence and written observations, the judge determines the case on the basis of all the evidence.', '38. An appeal against a conviction by the Criminal Court lies to the Supreme Court. The Public Prosecutor must appear on an appeal, even if he did not do so before the Criminal Court.', '39. The Supreme Court is empowered to review questions of both fact and law. According to Article 185, it may annul the entire proceedings or, alternatively, the judgment of the Criminal Court if it finds that serious errors occurred in the conduct of the case at first instance. In that event, the case may be referred back, in whole or in part, to the lower court for fresh proceedings.', '40. Under Article 171, a defendant may, with leave of the Public Prosecutor, file a summary appeal with the Supreme Court against a refusal by a Criminal Court judge to withdraw. In the absence of such leave, it is possible for the defendant, in an ordinary appeal to the Supreme Court, to ask for the Criminal Court proceedings to be annulled on the ground that the judge should have withdrawn.', '41. Article 36 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Law no. 85/1936) which, according to Article 15 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, applies also to criminal cases, provides that a judge shall withdraw in the following circumstances:', '(a) if he is a party or representative of or related to a party to the litigation;', '(b) if he has testified to the facts of the case or served as a surveyor or appraiser in connection with the case;', '(c) if he has argued the case or given advice to a party;', '(d) if he is hostile to a party;', '(e) if the case is of financial or moral concern to himself or his relatives;', '(f) if there is otherwise a risk that he will not be able to consider the case impartially.', 'If a judge is disqualified for any of the above-mentioned reasons, the Minister of Justice must appoint another judge to hear the case.', 'C. Revision of the Code of Criminal Procedure', '42. A revised Code of Criminal Procedure is expected to enter into force on 1 July 1992. Article 123 of the Bill provides that if the prosecutor does not appear at a court sitting, the case must be adjourned.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '43. In his application (no. 13778/88) lodged with the Commission on 19 November 1987, Mr Thorgeir Thorgeirson alleged violations of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3(c) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-c) (right to a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal and right to defend oneself) and Article 10 (art. 10) (right to freedom of expression) of the Convention as a result of the defamation proceedings instituted against him and his subsequent conviction.', '44. On 14 March 1990 the Commission declared admissible the complaints concerning:', '(a) the absence of the Public Prosecutor at certain court sittings during the applicant ’ s trial and its effect on the impartiality of the Reykjavik Criminal Court; and', '(b) the interference with the applicant ’ s freedom of expression.', 'The remainder of the complaints were declared inadmissible.', 'In its report adopted on 11 December 1990 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (unanimously) and that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (thirteen votes to one).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT', '45. At the hearing on 22 January 1992, the Government invited the Court to hold that, as submitted in their memorial of 16 September 1991, there had been no violation of the Convention in the present case.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)', '46. Mr Thorgeir Thorgeirson alleged that he had not received a hearing by an ""impartial tribunal"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, provides:', '""In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an ... impartial tribunal...""', 'The applicant complained that, under the current Icelandic legislation (see paragraph 36 above), less serious cases, which did not warrant an adversarial procedure, could be examined in the absence of the Public Prosecutor. This meant, according to the applicant, that district court judges were empowered in such cases to take over the prosecutor ’ s functions. This situation had been criticised by a number of district court judges and was, moreover, about to be changed: pursuant to Article 123 of the Bill revising the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was expected to enter into force on 1 July 1992, the case would have to be adjourned if the prosecutor did not appear.', 'The applicant contended that in his own case, in which the Public Prosecutor had been absent from a number of sittings of the Reykjavik Criminal Court, the result of this legislation had been that Judge Pétur Gudgeirsson - the single member of that court - had not only conducted the court investigation but had also taken on a role as a representative of the prosecution. Consequently, the Criminal Court did not satisfy the requirement of impartiality in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.', '47. This claim was contested by the Government and was not accepted by the Commission.', '48. It should be recalled that the Court ’ s task is not to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to or affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, amongst other authorities, the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, para. 45).', '49. The existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) must be determined according to a subjective test, that is on the basis of the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (ibid., para. 46).', '50. As to the subjective test, the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid., para. 47); the applicant has adduced no evidence to suggest that the judge in question was personally biased.', '51. Under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw.', 'This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid., para. 48).', '52. The Court notes that in the present case the Reykjavik Criminal Court held twelve sittings between 10 September 1985 and 16 June 1986. The Public Prosecutor was absent from the following six sittings which were devoted to the matters indicated:', '(a) 10 September 1985 : at the request of the applicant (who was also absent), the Court decided to adjourn the case (see paragraph 16 above);', '(b) 17 September 1985 : this sitting was of a preparatory character (see paragraph 16 above);', '(c) and (d) 24 and 25 September 1985: the court dealt only with procedural matters, unrelated to the merits of the case (see paragraphs 17-18 above);', '(e) 3 June 1986 : the applicant filed his written defence (see paragraph 23 above);', '(f) 16 June 1986 : the court delivered judgment (see paragraph 24 above).', 'On the other hand, the Public Prosecutor was, with one exception, present at all the sittings at which evidence was submitted and witnesses were heard (9 and 25 October 1985, 15 November 1985, 31 January 1986 and 17 February 1986; see paragraphs 20-21 above). The exception was the sitting of 17 February 1986, which was essentially devoted to the showing of a video-taped television programme. Both the applicant and the prosecutor appeared at a further sitting held on 28 April 1986, when they agreed that no further investigation was necessary (see paragraph 22 above).', '53. It can be seen from the foregoing that, at those sittings at which the Public Prosecutor was absent, the Reykjavik Criminal Court was not called upon to conduct any investigation into the merits of the case, let alone to assume any functions which might have been fulfilled by the prosecutor had he been present. In these circumstances, the Court does not consider that such fears as the applicant may have had, on account of the prosecutor ’ s absence, as regards the Reykjavik Court ’ s lack of impartiality can be held to be justified.', '54. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '55. Mr Thorgeir Thorgeirson claimed that he had been a victim of a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'This allegation was accepted by the Commission but contested by the Government.', '56. The Court considers - and this was not disputed - that the applicant ’ s conviction and sentence for defamation by the Reykjavik Criminal Court on 16 June 1986, as upheld by the Supreme Court on 20 October 1987 (see paragraphs 24-25 and 27 above), constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression. Such an interference entails a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", had an aim or aims that is or are legitimate under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the aforesaid aim or aims.', 'A. Was the interference ""prescribed by law""?', '57. The applicant, referring to the dissenting opinion of a member of the Supreme Court in his case (see paragraph 28 above), submitted that Article 108 of the Penal Code, as interpreted in the light of the constitutional right to freedom of expression, could not provide a proper basis for his conviction.', '58. However, the Court notes that the manner in which the Reykjavik Criminal Court and, subsequently, the majority of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above) interpreted and applied that Article in the present case was not excluded by its wording (see paragraph 31 above) and was, moreover, supported by precedent (see paragraph 32 above). Above all, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, amongst many other authorities, the Kruslin v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, p. 21, para. 29). Consequently, the Court agrees with the Government and the Commission that the interference was ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Did the interference have a legitimate aim or aims?', '59. It was not disputed that the applicant ’ s conviction and sentence were aimed at protecting the ""reputation ... of others"" and thus had an aim that is legitimate under this provision.', 'C. Was the interference ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '60. In contesting the view of the applicant and the Commission that the interference complained of was not ""necessary in a democratic society"", the Government made submissions that fall into two groups, one relating to questions of general principle and the other relating to the specific circumstances of the case.', '61. The submissions in the first group may be summarised as follows.', '(a) The Court ’ s Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986 (Series A no. 103), Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989 (Series A no. 149) and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991 (Series A no. 204) showed that the wide limits of acceptable criticism in political discussion did not apply to the same extent in the discussion of other matters of public interest. The issues of public interest raised by the applicant ’ s articles could not be included in the category of political discussion, which denoted direct or indirect participation by citizens in the decision-making process in a democratic society.', '(b) The actions of civil servants should continually be subject to scrutiny and debate and be open to criticism. However, since they had no means of replying, it was not permissible to accuse them, without legitimate cause, of criminal conduct.', '(c) Apart from the differences referred to under (a), it followed clearly from the three judgments cited that a person who claimed that his freedom of expression had been unnecessarily restricted must himself have exercised it in a manner consistent with democratic principles: he must have been in good faith as to the legitimacy of his statements and have voiced them in a way that was compatible with democratic aims; in addition, the statements must have effectively promoted those aims and been supported by facts.', '62. With regard to the specific circumstances of the case, the Government made the following submissions.', '(a) The statements in the applicant ’ s articles lacked an objective and factual basis. Police brutality was very uncommon in Iceland; during the past fifteen years, there had been only two instances of policemen being convicted of physical assault. The story of the young man at the local hospital mentioned in the first article (see paragraph 9(8)- (9) above) was completely untrue and had merely been invented to provide arguments for a campaign against the police. The applicant had refused to co-operate in clarifying this matter and had adduced no proof to support his contention. In this connection, the Government referred to a declaration by a certain Mr Trausti Ellidason, who had been at the hospital at the relevant time, and to the proceedings before the Reykjavik Criminal Court (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above). Although it was the Skafti Jónsson case (see paragraph 8 above) that had prompted the applicant to act, his first article had not relied on that case, which it described as ""of little importance"". It dealt instead with police brutality that would never be brought to the public ’ s knowledge and stated that ""the real problem"" was ""in fact bigger and much more horrifying"" (see paragraph 9(4) above). In the second article, the applicant had not discussed individual cases, but a situation which he said comprised at least several hundred cases (see paragraph 10(8) above).', '(b) The applicant ’ s articles had not been confined to a criticism of the manner in which the police performed their duties. The author ’ s principal aim had not been to advocate new methods of investigating complaints against the police, but to damage the reputation of the Reykjavik police as a whole, by making specific allegations of misconduct, including serious crime.', '(c) Even if it were accepted that there was a factual basis for the applicant ’ s statements, he had clearly overstepped all reasonable limits by using malicious, insulting and vituperative language and by condemning the police on a slender foundation.', '(d) The sanctions imposed, which did not include confiscation of the articles, had been insignificant and were not likely to discourage open discussion of matters of public concern.', '63. The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society; subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10), is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).', 'In the present case, the applicant expressed his views by having them published in a newspaper. Regard must therefore be had to the pre-eminent role of the press in a State governed by the rule of law (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, para. 43). Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for ""the protection of the reputation of ... others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59).', '64. On the questions of general principle raised by the Government, the Court observes that there is no warrant in its case-law for distinguishing, in the manner suggested by the Government, between political discussion and discussion of other matters of public concern. Their submission which seeks to restrict the right to freedom of expression on the basis of the recognition in Article 10 (art. 10) that the exercise thereof ""carries with it duties and responsibilities"" fails to appreciate that such exercise can be restricted only on the conditions provided for in the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2).', '65. As regards the specific circumstances of the case, the Court is unable to accept the Government ’ s argument that the statements in the applicant ’ s articles lacked an objective and factual basis.', 'The first article took as its starting-point one specific case of ill-treatment - the Skafti Jónsson case - which gave rise to extensive public debate and led to the conviction of the policeman responsible. It is undisputed that this incident did actually occur.', 'With regard to the other factual elements contained in the articles, the Court notes that these consisted essentially of references to ""stories"" or ""rumours"" - emanating from persons other than the applicant - or ""public opinion"", involving allegations of police brutality. For instance, it was the room-mates of the young man at the hospital who had recounted, and the hospital personnel who had confirmed, that he had been injured by the police (see paragraph 9(9) above). As was pointed out by the Commission, it has not been established that this ""story"" was altogether untrue and merely invented. Again, according to the first article, the applicant had found out that most people knew of various stories of that kind, which were so similar and numerous that they could hardly be treated as mere lies (see paragraph 9(10) above).', 'In short, the applicant was essentially reporting what was being said by others about police brutality. He was convicted by the Reykjavik Criminal Court of an offence under Article 108 of the Penal Code partly because of failure to justify what it considered to be his own allegations, namely that unspecified members of the Reykjavik police had committed a number of acts of serious assault resulting in disablement of their victims, as well as forgery and other criminal offences (see paragraphs 9(9)-(10), 10(15) and 24 above). In so far as the applicant was required to establish the truth of his statements, he was, in the Court ’ s opinion, faced with an unreasonable, if not impossible task.', '66. The Court is also not convinced by the Government ’ s contention that the principal aim of the applicant ’ s articles was to damage the reputation of the Reykjavik police as a whole.', 'In the first place, his criticisms could not be taken as an attack against all the members, or any specific member, of the Reykjavik police force. As stated in the first article, the applicant assumed that ""comparatively few individuals [were] responsible"" and that an independent investigation would hopefully show that a small minority of policemen were responsible (see paragraph 9(19)-(20) above). Secondly, as the Court has observed in paragraph 65 above, the applicant was essentially reporting what was being said by others.', 'These circumstances - combined with a perusal of the first article - confirm his contention that his principal purpose was to urge the Minister of Justice to set up an independent and impartial body to investigate complaints of police brutality. The second article, which was written in response to certain statements made by a police officer during a television programme, must be seen as a continuation of the first article.', '67. The articles bore, as was not in fact disputed, on a matter of serious public concern. It is true that both articles were framed in particularly strong terms. However, having regard to their purpose and the impact which they were designed to have, the Court is of the opinion that the language used cannot be regarded as excessive.', '68. Finally, the Court considers that the conviction and sentence were capable of discouraging open discussion of matters of public concern.', '69. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court has come to the conclusion that the reasons advanced by the Government do not suffice to show that the interference complained of was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. It was therefore not ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '70. Accordingly, there was a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '71. Mr Thorgeir Thorgeirson sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) according to which:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Work carried out by the applicant', '72. The applicant claimed 875,250 Icelandic crowns for his own work on the case over seven years, which he said had occupied forty-one days of his spare time per year.', 'The Court affords ""just satisfaction"" only ""if necessary"". The applicant, who was assisted by counsel both in Iceland and in Strasbourg, has not established why it is necessary to compensate him for his own work.', 'B. Pecuniary damage', '73. The applicant sought 2,020,200 Icelandic crowns as compensation for loss of earnings (24,050 crowns per month during the years 1984 to 1991) resulting from his ""dissident ’ s status"".', 'The Government disputed this claim, while the Commission left the matter to be decided by the Court.', 'The Court is unable to accept this claim since it has not been established that there was a sufficient connection between the alleged loss and the matter held in the present judgment to be in breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'C. Costs and expenses', '74. The applicant claimed in respect of costs and expenses:', '(a) 218,160 Icelandic crowns for the translation of documents submitted in the Strasbourg proceedings;', '(b) 134,392 crowns for computer processing of such documents;', '(c) 250,000 crowns for Mr Tómas Gunnarsson ’ s fees for 100 hours ’ work (at 2,008 crowns per hour, plus 24.5% value-added tax) in connection with his representation before the Convention institutions;', '(d) 73,473 crowns for the fine imposed and legal costs in the domestic proceedings.', '75. As to items (a) and (b), the Government expressed their willingness to pay a suitable amount, to be assessed by the Court on the basis of particulars supplied by the applicant. In their view, item (c) was reasonable.', 'On the other hand, the Government pointed out that the fine and the domestic legal costs had never been paid by the applicant. Moreover, they stated that the fine had become unenforceable by reason of lapse of time and that they were prepared to take appropriate measures to ensure that the costs would not be collected, should the Court find a violation.', '76. The Court accepts the claims under headings (a), (b) and (c). Taking account of the Court ’ s case-law in this field as well as the relevant legal aid payments made to the applicant by the Council of Europe, the Court considers that he is entitled to be reimbursed, for costs and expenses, the sum of 530,000 Icelandic crowns.']",3,is,001-57795,1

Mr Schwabe is an Austrian citizen residing at St Andrä. At the relevant time, he was Chairman of the Young Austrian People ’ s Party ( Junge Österreichische Volkspartei, ÖVP) for the District of Wolfsberg in Carinthia and councillor ( Gemeinderat ) of St Andrä.', 'A. The applicant ’ s press release and its background', '7. In December 1984 Mr Tomaschitz, Mayor of Maria Rain in Carinthia and a member of the ÖVP, was convicted of negligently causing bodily harm ( fahrlässige Körperverletzung ) and of abandoning the victim ( Imstichlassen eines Verletzten ) of a traffic accident whilst under the influence of alcohol (at least 1.75 per mille). He was sentenced to four months ’ imprisonment.', '8. The question whether the Mayor should resign because of his conviction later became the subject of discussion in political circles and the press in Carinthia.', 'On 13 August 1985 the Carinthian newspaper Kleine Zeitung published an article headed ""If Tomaschitz doesn ’ t think it over, we will"". That article quoted from an interview with the Head of the Provincial Government, Mr Wagner, who was the Chairman of the Carinthia branch of the Austrian Socialist Party ( Sozialistische Partei Österreichs - SPÖ), about the question whether the Mayor should resign or not. Mr Wagner stated that, although an accident of the kind in question could happen to anybody, it was not acceptable that a person who had acted in such a way should remain in public office. He continued: ""I do not intend to take part in a witch hunt, but after a period of reflection Tomaschitz ought to realise that he must resign"". According to Mr Wagner, however, that was primarily a matter for the ÖVP. He nevertheless concluded by saying that if Mr Tomaschitz would not think it over, the Regional Supervisory Authority ( Gemeindeaufsicht des Landes ) would.', '9. On 19 August 1985 Mr Schwabe issued a press release by way of reply to that article and sent it to several Carinthian newspapers. On 20 August the Kleine Zeitung published a summary, headed ""Looking after morality in the SPÖ"". A complete version of the release appeared on the same day in the Neue Volkszeitung (an ÖVP newspaper), under a headline ""Different standards?"" ( Zweierlei Maß ?). It read:', '""Councillor Karl Schwabe, Chairman of the Young ÖVP for the Wolfsberg District, stated in a broadcast that, after being convicted for leaving the scene of an accident without reporting it, Josef Tomaschitz, the Mayor of Maria Rain and a member of the ÖVP, would unquestionably have to resign.', 'However, he added that Mr Wagner, the Head of the Carinthian Government, did not have the slightest moral right to attack Mayor Tomaschitz for his refusal to resign. Mr Wagner had known for years that his Deputy, Erwin Frühbauer, had caused an accident on 10 July 1966 at Scheifling ( Styria ) while under the influence of alcohol ( im alkoholisierten Zustand ). The accident had left two children fatherless. One could not help feeling that the Head of the Carinthian Government applied stricter standards to a ‘ small mayor of a village ’, who was a member of another political party, than to his ‘ party friend ’ and Deputy, Frühbauer. Schwabe concluded that Wagner ’ s credibility would be enhanced if he were to provide, within the SPÖ, for the political morals which he requires of others.""', '10. The applicant had based his press release on an article that had appeared in the Viennese magazine Profil on 9 March 1984. It referred to the circumstances of Mr Frühbauer ’ s car accident in 1966, in which a man had died and other persons had been injured, and contained the following passage:', '""...', 'Erwin Frühbauer was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.8 per mille. That was the limit.', 'Less than a year later, on 31 May 1967, Frühbauer, whose immunity as a Member of Parliament had been lifted, was sentenced by the Leoben Regional Court to a prison term of six months, suspended for three years, for negligent homicide.', 'There was no conviction for intoxication ( Alkoholisierung ). Jurists are still guessing at the reasons because, according to Article 5 para. 1 of the 1960 Road Traffic Code, impairment by intoxication is presumed ‘ at 0.8 per mille or more ’.', 'Be that as it may. I do not want (and the criminal law does not allow me) to reproach Frühbauer with his conviction at that time. After all, no one is immune from being similarly involved in a traffic accident.', 'My accusation is a political one. When Frühbauer was appointed Transport Minister by Kreisky in 1970, he kept quiet about his conviction, or at least about the fact that at that time he still had a criminal record ( noch vorbestraft war).', 'In fact on 31 May 1967, the date of the judgment, the three-year period of suspension of his sentence began to run. Six weeks before the end of that period, on 21 April 1970, Mr Frühbauer was appointed Transport Minister but he continued to have a criminal record for a long time afterwards, because of the period which was then applicable with regard to the cancellation of such records. He was thus, to my knowledge, the only Minister of the Second Republic to have a criminal record ...""', 'The applicant had verified the contents of the Profil article in a telephone conversation with its author. Furthermore, he had taken into account the judgment of 31 May 1967 of the Leoben Regional Court ( Kreisgericht ). In determining sentence, that court had regarded as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the accused had been driving after consuming alcohol in an amount that brought him close to the level at which a driver was presumed to be intoxicated ( Alkoholisierung, 0.8 per mille).', 'B. Criminal proceedings against Mr Schwabe', '1. Before the Klagenfurt Regional Court', '11. On 4 September 1985 Mr Frühbauer requested the Klagenfurt Regional Court ( Landesgericht, ""the Regional Court "") to initiate a preliminary investigation against Mr Schwabe. After completion of the investigation, Mr Frühbauer brought a private prosecution under Article 111 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 113 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 18 and 19 below).', '12. On 26 September 1986 the applicant was convicted of defamation (Article 111 paras. 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code) and of having reproached a person with an offence for which he had already served his sentence (Article 113). The penalty imposed was a fine of 3,000 schillings or, in default of payment, thirty days ’ imprisonment. The Regional Court also ordered the seizure of the relevant issue of the Neue Volkszeitung and the publication of its judgment and awarded to Mr Frühbauer compensation of 10,000 schillings, to be paid by the owners of the newspaper. In addition, the latter were declared to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine and the complainant ’ s costs.', 'After reciting the relevant facts, the Regional Court concluded that, contrary to Article 113, Mr Schwabe had reproached Mr Frühbauer with a conviction, relating to a traffic accident, that dated back about twenty years. Furthermore, his statement that the complainant was under the influence of alcohol and his comparison of the accident in question with Mr Tomaschitz ’ s, in addition to his criticism of the complainant for lacking political morals, amounted to defamation.', '13. According to the Regional Court, Article 113 was primarily aimed at securing the reintegration of criminal offenders, but it was applicable irrespective of whether or not reproaching them with a previous conviction jeopardised that reintegration.', 'Mr Schwabe had not been obliged under Article 114 para. 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below) to make the impugned statement. The fact that a political party felt embarrassed about a car accident of one of its officials was not an excuse for ""digging out"" a very old accident of an official of the opposite party. Moreover, the applicant had not been under a duty to reply to a political opponent, since Mr Wagner ’ s criticisms were addressed to Mayor Tomaschitz and not to him. In particular, Mr Schwabe, the Chairman of a small district organisation, did not need to react by defaming a third person.', '14. In the Regional Court ’ s view, moreover, it was not open to the applicant to plead that his allegation that Mr Frühbauer had been driving under the influence of alcohol was correct. The man in the street would conclude from such a statement that the latter - like Mr Tomaschitz - had had a blood alcohol content of more than 0.80 per mille at the time of the accident. In fact, a lower level was tolerated by the legislature and the public, and the applicant had not mentioned that the complainant had not been convicted of drunken driving (in alkoholbeeinträchtigtem Zustand ).', 'Neither could Mr Schwabe maintain that he had intended to refer to a blood alcohol content lower than 0.8 per mille. The aim of his press release had been to put both accidents in moral terms on an equal footing, which would entail the same consequence, namely the resignation of the two officials concerned. That, together with the title of the article, ""Different standards?"", could have led the reader to believe that the complainant ’ s blood alcohol content had also attained the forbidden level at the time of his accident.', 'The defendant also could not claim that his press release had been directed not against Mr Frühbauer, but against Mr Wagner. It was true that the criticism relating to a lack of political morals had been primarily aimed not at the latter, who was responsible in principle for the political morals of the SPÖ, but at the former, who had not resigned after his accident. However, that particular allegation could not in itself constitute defamation, since a politician had to be tolerant in this respect; what was decisive in the present case was the comparison of the two accidents from a moral point of view.', 'In respect of this defamation too, the applicant could not rely on Article 114 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, because, as he had or should have been aware, the impugned statement had been incorrect. Furthermore, in the present case proof of good faith (Article 111 para. 3; see paragraph 18 below) was not relevant, since the offence had taken place through a publication; neither was proof of proper journalistic care (section 29 of the Media Act, Mediengesetz; see paragraph 21 below), since the defendant was not a journalist. As to proof of truth, the Regional Court considered evidence given by a witness of Mr Frühbauer ’ s accident in 1966, as well as the expert opinions submitted in the relevant criminal proceedings in 1967, and concluded that Mr Schwabe had failed to prove the truth of his allegations.', '2. Before the Graz Court of Appeal', '15. On 5 February 1987 the applicant lodged an appeal ( Berufung ) against his conviction with the Graz Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ). He submitted in particular that he had written his press release in the context of a political discussion and in reply to criticisms by the Head of the Carinthian Government expressed in respect of a member of the ÖVP and of that party, and that the release had not been directed against Mr Frühbauer. He had, accordingly, felt himself obliged to defend his own party and to inform the public about the Head of the Provincial Government ’ s political morals and apparent motives. He had then remembered the 1984 Profil article (see paragraph 10 above) and found that the two accidents raised the same problem, namely whether it was proper for a person with a criminal conviction to exercise official functions. He had thought that this question was worth discussing and wanted to draw the attention of the public to a possible information lacuna. Finally, he had considered his statement about the complainant having driven under the influence of alcohol to be correct, since it was based on the formulation used by the Leoben Regional Court in its judgment of 31 May 1967 (see paragraph 10 above); and it was also justified in the context of a political discussion.', '16. On 29 April 1987 the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Schwabe ’ s appeal.', 'The court observed that the applicant ’ s statement had clearly amounted to a reproach concerning a criminal conviction for which the sentence had already been served, within the meaning of Article 113 of the Criminal Code. In its view, he had not been compelled to reply to Mr Wagner. Neither had he been given any mandate to reply in the name of the ÖVP, nor had he himself been addressed directly as Chairman of the Young ÖVP or as a member of the party ’ s executive committee. Someone who by his conduct has given good reason for criticising him must accept attacks on his honour to a greater extent than someone who has not. Furthermore, Mr Frühbauer himself had made no statement which called for reaction on the part of Mr Schwabe.', 'The court also upheld the Regional Court ’ s judgment in all other respects.', '17. The judgment was served on the applicant on 4 September 1987. He thereupon requested the Attorney-General ( Generalprokurator ) to file a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ), with reference, inter alia, to the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention and to the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986 (Series A no. 103-B).', 'Mr Schwabe was informed on 27 October 1987 that the Attorney- General did not intend to take any action.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code', '18. Article 111 of the Criminal Code provides:', '""1. Anyone who in such a way that it may be perceived by a third person accuses another of possessing a contemptible character or attitude or of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...', '2. Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...', '3. The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. As regards the offence defined in paragraph 1, he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true.""', 'Under Article 112, ""evidence of the truth and of good faith shall not be admissible unless the person making the statement pleads the correctness of the statement or his good faith ..."".', 'Under Article 114 para. 1 ""conduct of the kind mentioned in Article 111 ... is justified if it constitutes the fulfilment of a legal duty or the exercise of a right"". Under paragraph 2 of the same provision ""a person who is forced for special reasons to make an allegation within the meaning of Article 111 ... in the particular form and manner in which it was made, is not to be punished, unless that allegation is untrue and the offender could have been aware thereof if he had acted with the necessary care"".', '19. Article 113 of the Criminal Code reads as follows:', '""Anyone who in such a way that it may be perceived by a third person reproaches another with having committed a criminal offence in respect of which the sentence has already been served, or has been waived or reduced (even if only conditionally) or in respect of which the sentence has been provisionally deferred shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three months or a fine ...""', 'B. The relevant provisions of the Media Act', '20. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim compensation from him. Furthermore, the publisher may be declared to be liable jointly and severally with the person convicted of a media offence for the fines imposed and for the costs of the proceedings (section 35).', 'The person defamed may request the forfeiture of the publication by which a media offence has been committed (section 33), as well as the publication of the judgment in so far as this appears necessary for the information of the public (section 34).', '21. Section 29 of the Media Act provides as follows:', '""1. A media owner (publisher) or media employee shall not be punishable for an offence relating to material appearing in the media, in respect of which proof of truth is admissible, not only if proof of truth has been brought but also if there was a predominant public interest in publication and even with proper journalistic care being applied he had sufficient grounds for considering the statement to be true. However, in respect of such an offence relating to a person ’ s private life, a media owner (publisher) or media employee shall not be punishable only if the statement is true and directly connected with public affairs.', '2. Such proof is to be received only if the accused relies thereon. In cases within the first sentence of paragraph 1, the court must receive proof of truth, if tendered by the accused and admissible, even if it assumes that the exercise of proper journalistic care has been proved.', '3. If an accused is acquitted only because the conditions specified in the first sentence of paragraph 1 are met, the court must, in analogous application of section 34, order publication of the finding that proof of truth has not been tendered or has not succeeded, and order that the accused is to bear the costs of the criminal proceedings including the costs of such publication.', '4. Article 111 para. 3 and Article 112 of the Criminal Code shall not apply.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '22. Mr Schwabe applied to the Commission on 1 February 1988 citing Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'On 11 October 1989 the Commission declared the application (no. 13704/88) admissible. In its report of 8 January 1991 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (ten votes to six). The full text of its opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT', '23. At the hearing on 24 February 1992, the Agent of the Government requested the Court ""to hold in its judgment that the applicant ’ s right to freedom of opinion under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention has not been violated by his being sentenced to pay a fine of 3,000 schillings"".', 'For his part, the applicant asked the Court to find that ""Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention has been violated, and that the Austrian Republic should therefore pay [the applicant] just satisfaction of 225,644.62 schillings"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '24. Mr Schwabe alleged that his conviction by the Klagenfurt Regional Court for defamation and for having reproached a person with a previous criminal offence had breached Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'This allegation was contested by the Government, but was accepted by the Commission.', '25. The sanction complained of clearly constituted an ""interference"" with the applicant ’ s exercise of his freedom of expression, as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1). This has not been disputed.', 'Nor was it contested that the interference was ""prescribed by law"", namely Articles 111 and 113 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above), and had a legitimate aim, namely the protection of ""the reputation or rights of others"", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'Argument before the Court centred on the question whether the interference could be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '26. According to the applicant, it should be possible in a democratic society to refer to previous offences committed by politicians, even when sentences have been served, suspended or waived. The aim of Article 113 of the Criminal Code was to secure the social reintegration of criminal offenders, and Mr Frühbauer had held public office in Austria for more than twenty-five years both before and after the press release in question. Furthermore, it had not been his intention to defame the latter, but rather to point out that Mr Wagner, the Head of the Carinthian Government, had no moral entitlement to call for the resignation of Mayor Tomaschitz after his conviction as a result of a traffic accident. This was thus a value-judgment.', '27. The Government submitted, however, that the requirements of the protection of an individual ’ s reputation, as provided for in Articles 111 and 113 of the Criminal Code, should prevail in the present case. The applicant had given an incomplete account of the facts and made misleading statements by establishing a connection between two car accidents which were not comparable. Accordingly, the Klagenfurt Regional Court had found that he had failed to prove the truth of his allegations. Furthermore, the subject of the debate was the Mayor ’ s car accident, and there was no reason why Mr Schwabe should have referred to another accident which had occurred many years previously.', '28. The Commission, while citing the previous Austrian cases already decided by the Court (see the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103-B, and the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204), observed that in a democratic society politicians should accept criticism even if it is based on an ""annoying"" comparison of two incidents which might appear far-fetched.', '29. The Court will examine this question in the light of the principles which emerge from its previous case-law (see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 22-24, paras. 48-50, the Sunday Times (no. 1) v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, pp. 35-37, para. 59, and pp. 40-41, para. 65, the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, Series A no. 103-B, pp. 25-26, paras. 38-42, the above-mentioned Oberschlick judgment, Series A no. 204, pp. 25-26, paras. 57-59, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30 para. 59, the Sunday Times (no. 2) v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, pp. 28-29, para. 50, and the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 22-24, paras. 42-43 and 46).', 'Where what is at stake is the limits of acceptable criticism in the context of public debate on a political question of general interest, the Court, in the exercise of its supervisory function, has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with those principles and, moreover, that in doing so they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the above-mentioned Oberschlick judgment, Series A no. 204, p. 26, para. 60).', 'For this purpose the Court will consider the impugned judicial decisions in the light of the case as a whole, including the applicant ’ s publication and the context in which it was written.', '30. Mr Schwabe was convicted of defamation for having stated in his press release of 19 August 1985 that the Deputy Head of the Carinthian Government had caused a traffic accident in 1966 under the influence of alcohol. The Klagenfurt Regional Court considered it decisive that the applicant had compared this accident with the Mayor ’ s, without mentioning that, unlike Mr Tomaschitz, Mr Frühbauer had not been convicted of drunken driving. This omission, according to the Regional Court, could have led the reader to believe that the accidents were comparable, as far as the drivers ’ blood alcohol content was concerned. In this respect, it held that the applicant had failed to prove the truth of his allegations (see paragraph 14 above).', '31. The Court notes that Mr Schwabe ’ s press release was a reaction to the interview given by the Head of the Carinthian Government, a member of the Austrian Socialist Party, suggesting that the Mayor of Maria Rain, who was a member of the People ’ s Party (the applicant ’ s party), should resign because of his conviction (see paragraph 8 above).', 'It is apparent from the release, when read as a whole, that the applicant ’ s main concern was to show that Mr Wagner applied different and stricter standards of political morality to a ""small mayor of a village"", belonging to another political party, than to his ""party friend"" and deputy (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant ’ s press release did not try to compare the two traffic accidents from a legal point of view. It only sought to make a statement concerning political morality. The reference to the 1966 accident was incidental to this main issue, which was a matter of public interest.', 'Even if at the outset, as the Government maintained, neither the applicant nor Mr Frühbauer was directly involved in the political discussion, which concerned primarily the Mayor and the Head of the Provincial Government, the question subsequently became, following the latter ’ s intervention, a matter of general debate on political morals between the two rival parties (ÖVP and SPÖ; see paragraph 8 above).', '32. A politician ’ s previous criminal convictions of the kind at issue here, together with his public conduct in other respects, may be relevant factors in assessing his fitness to exercise political functions.', '33. The applicant had based his statements concerning the 1966 traffic accident on an article published in the magazine Profil on 9 March 1984, and had verified the facts with the author of that article (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant ’ s press release was shorter than that article, and thus gave only an incomplete account of the circumstances of the accident (see paragraph 9 above). However, it must be noted that the applicant used substantially the same words as had appeared in the judgment of 31 May 1967 of the Leoben Regional Court. That court considered as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the politician had consumed alcohol before the accident (see paragraph 10 above).', '34. The applicant ’ s conviction for defamation stemmed, according to the Austrian courts, from the fact that he failed to prove the truth of his statement. They interpreted the words ""while under the influence of alcohol"", appearing in the press release, as meaning an alcohol content of 0.8 per mille or more, on the basis of the comparison made with Mr Tomaschitz ’ s accident (see paragraph 14 above).', 'The Court does not, however, consider it established that the applicant ’ s statement about Mr Frühbauer ’ s alcohol consumption was misleading. It moreover points out that the two accidents were not the subject of direct comparison but were mentioned only in relation to the different attitude of Mr Wagner towards them. It is significant that the applicant described both accidents in completely different terms (see paragraph 9 above). He nevertheless concluded that they had enough features in common to warrant the resignation of both the politicians concerned.', 'The impugned comparison thus essentially amounted to a value-judgment, for which no proof of truth is possible (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Oberschlick judgment, Series A no. 204, p. 27, para. 63). The Court notes in this connection that the facts on which the applicant based his value-judgment were substantially correct and his good faith does not give rise to serious doubts. He cannot be considered to have exceeded the limits of freedom of expression.', '35. It follows from the foregoing that the interference complained of by Mr Schwabe was not ""necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of the reputation ... of others"".', 'There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '36. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '37. The applicant first claimed the sums corresponding to the fine imposed (3,000 Austrian schillings), Mr Frühbauer ’ s costs (32,242.42 schillings) and the compensation awarded to the latter by the Regional Court (10,000 schillings) in its judgment of 26 September 1986.', '38. The first two items are closely related to the violation of Article 10 (art. 10) found by the Court, and the applicant is, as the Government agreed, entitled to recover the sum of 35,242.42 schillings under these heads.', 'On the other hand, the amount of 10,000 schillings awarded to Mr Frühbauer was to be paid by the owners of the Neue Volkszeitung (see paragraph 12 above), and the applicant has not shown why he is entitled to compensation under this head.', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '39. The applicant also claimed 50,000 schillings as compensation for the damage caused to his reputation by his conviction.', 'The Court considers, however, like the Delegate of the Commission, that in the circumstances of the case the finding of a violation contained in this judgment constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for any prejudice of this kind.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '40. Finally, Mr Schwabe requested the reimbursement of 50,402.20 schillings for his costs and expenses in Austria. Whilst not objecting to an award in this respect, the Government stated that they were unable to comment on this claim in the absence of a detailed statement of costs from the applicant ’ s lawyer.', 'In the Court ’ s view, however, the amount claimed appears reasonable and must therefore be awarded in full.', '41. As to the costs and expenses before the Convention institutions, the applicant sought 70,000 schillings in respect of fees and disbursements and 10,000 schillings for travel expenses for attending the Court ’ s hearing.', 'The Government did not object to this claim.', 'The Court finds the sums sought to be reasonable and, accordingly, allows them in their entirety.', '42. Mr Schwabe is thus entitled to 130,402.20 schillings for his costs and expenses.']",3,at,001-57757,1

THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE', '8. Mr Istvan Herczegfalvy is a Hungarian citizen who has lived in Austria since 1964. He currently resides in Vienna.', 'A. The proceedings', '9. From 13 May 1972 to 13 May 1977 he served two prison sentences in succession, following convictions pronounced by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court ( Landesgericht für Strafsachen ) and confirmed in part by the Supreme Court ( Oberster Gerichtshof ), inter alia for assaults on his wife, clients of his television repair business and public officials.', '10. The Inner Vienna District Court ( Bezirksgericht Wien Innere Stadt ) on 23 December 1975 and the Vienna Regional Civil Court ( Landesgericht für Zivilrechtssachen ), acting as guardianship court ( Pflegschaftsgericht ), on 3 November 1977 declared the applicant partly incapacitated ( beschränkt entmündigt ) and appointed an adviser ( Beistand ) for him. They did so on the basis of a psychiatrist ’ s report which had been drawn up following numerous complaints by him about prison conditions.', 'On 9 August 1983 the District Court appointed a new adviser, who has acted as such since then. According to a ruling of the guardianship court of 19 July 1984, his position was equivalent as from 1 July 1984 to that of a curator ( Sachwalter ) within the meaning of Article 273 (3), sub-paragraph 3, of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below).', '11. In the meantime, further prosecutions were brought against Mr Herczegfalvy for assaults on warders and fellow prisoners and for serious threats against judges.', 'On 10 May 1977 the Regional Court ordered that once he had finished serving his sentence on 13 May (see paragraph 9 above) the applicant should remain in detention under Article 180 (2), sub-paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 40 below), as there was reason to fear that he might attempt to abscond and might commit other offences. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed to the Review Chamber ( Ratskammer ) of the Regional Court and to the Vienna Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ), whose rulings were given on 18 May and 21 June respectively. The pre-trial detention ( Untersuchungshaft ) was confirmed by the presiding judge of the Regional Court on 2 November 1977.', '12. In accordance with the opinions of several experts, the presiding judge on 9 January 1978 ordered Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s provisional placement ( vorläufige Unterbringung ) in an institution for mentally ill offenders (Article 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 44 below). The order was confirmed by the Review Chamber on 6 March and the Court of Appeal on 19 April 1 978, and the applicant was transferred to the special prison at Mittersteig, Vienna.', '13. According to the psychiatrists who examined him, he was suffering from paranoia querulans, which was equivalent to a mental illness and meant that he was not responsible for his acts; he was extremely aggressive and incapable of understanding that his behaviour was unlawful, and there was a risk that attendance at the trial could harm his health.', 'Following these reports, the public prosecutor ’ s office amended the indictment on 15 June 1978 and now sought Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s detention rather than conviction. From that date the detention in issue was based on Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 44 below). The applicant ’ s appeal against the amended indictment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 30 August 1978.', '14. The hearing before the Regional Court took place on 9 and 10 January 1979. It had previously been necessary to adjourn a hearing arranged for 14 December 1976 because the case-file had been lost, to adjourn a hearing of 3 May 1977 because of the applicant ’ s request for further witnesses to be called, a hearing of 25 October 1977 because the presiding judge was absent, one of 2 November 1977 because fresh evidence had been produced, one of 6 March 1978 because of mistakes in sending out summonses, and one of 5 April 1978 because the applicant had spat in the presiding judge ’ s face, which had led to the indictment being amended (see paragraph 13 above).', 'On 10 January 1979 the court found that the charges against Mr Herczegfalvy had been proved and ordered him to be detained under Article 21 (1) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 45 below), on the grounds that he was dangerous and not criminally responsible for his acts. The court relied on the opinions of three psychiatrists who had each diagnosed paranoia querulans which from 1975 at least had been equivalent to a mental illness.', '15. The applicant brought an application for a declaration of nullity ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde ) to the Supreme Court. The Regional Court decided, however, that pending the decision he should remain provisionally detained under Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but in prison, on the psychiatrist ’ s recommendation.', '16. On 28 June 1979 the Regional Court, relying on section 50 of the Hospitals Law, ordered that the detention should be continued and that the applicant should be transferred as a matter of urgency to a psychiatric hospital, so that the treatment he required could be carried out. Mr Herczegfalvy stayed there from 29 June to 23 July 1979 and was then returned to the prison.', 'The Vienna Court of Appeal, to which the applicant had appealed, held on 29 August 1979 that it had no jurisdiction: as Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was the only provision which could apply, it was for the Review Chamber of the Regional Court to hear the appeal.', '17. On 5 September 1979 the Review Chamber upheld the detention in issue. Applying Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it ordered Mr Herczegfalvy to be sent to the Vienna psychiatric hospital so that he could receive urgent medical and socio- and psycho-therapeutic treatment there, which was essential inter alia because of the hunger strike he had carried on since 2 August 1979. On 10 September 1979 he was admitted to ward 23 of that hospital, and stayed there until his release on 28 November 1984.', 'The applicant ’ s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Vienna Court of Appeal on 8 October 1979.', '18. In the meantime the Supreme Court had on 3 October 1979 varied the judgment of 10 January 1979 in part (see paragraphs 14-15 above), quashed the detention order and remitted the case to the Regional Court.', '19. On 4 December 1979 Mr Herczegfalvy requested his release. On 14 December the investigating judge informed him that he continued to be detained in accordance with Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', 'At that judge ’ s request, the psychiatric hospital submitted a report dated 17 January 1980 expressing the opinion that it was not possible to place the applicant in ordinary pre-trial detention, as his aggressive behaviour was still causing danger to those around him.', 'Pursuant to Article 429 (4), the Review Chamber and the Court of Appeal extended the detention in question in 1980.', '20. After hearings on 20 March and 9 April 1980 the Regional Court, to which the case had been remitted (see paragraph 18 above), found that the charges against Mr Herczegfalvy - which included further serious threats against a judge on 24 December 1979 - had been proved and ordered him to be detained in an institution for mentally ill offenders under Article 21 (1) of the Criminal Code. It based its decision on the judgment of 10 January 1979, the three psychiatric reports on which it had been based (see paragraph 14 above), and the opinions of the authors of the reports, who had appeared at the hearing and stated that despite certain improvements there had been no fundamental change in the situation.', 'As the applicant had withdrawn his appeal and application for a declaration of nullity in writing on 30 October 1980 and at a hearing on 6 November, the judgment was on the latter date declared binding by a final order ( Endverfügung ), which set the date of 1 October 1981 for the next judicial review of the detention (Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 46 below).', 'The applicant subsequently challenged the validity of his declarations. He said that he had made them only with a view to his repatriation to Hungary, which was discussed on 6 November 1980 but did not come about.', '21. On 8 February 1982 the Regional Court, acting under Article 21 (1) of the Criminal Code, extended Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s detention, as a psychiatric report produced at the request of that court stated that he was a dangerous person. The court took its decision under Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code, after an official of the psychiatric hospital had stated to the court that the annual review of the lawfulness of the detention should have taken place on 1 October 1981 at the latest (see paragraph 20 above).', '22. On 13 July, 19 September and a date in October 1983 the applicant requested his release, pointing out that the period for carrying out the annual review had expired on 8 February 1983. On receiving the first of these applications, the court consulted a psychiatrist, who submitted a report on 22 October recommending the applicant ’ s release subject to supervision (see paragraph 33 below).', 'An application to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction ( Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde ) was made to the Court of Appeal, which ordered the Regional Court to reach a decision speedily; on 16 February 1984 the latter court ordered a further extension of the detention in issue. Taking into account the opinions of the psychiatric expert and the director of the hospital, filed on 25 January 1984, it considered that there had been no fundamental change in Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s mental state. He was still suffering from paranoia querulans, and if released would undoubtedly refuse to follow the necessary course of treatment; he would consequently be likely to bring numerous complaints or even carry out the threats he had made, in particular those against the prison staff (see paragraph 33 below).', 'On 4 April 1984 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s appeal and confirmed that the requirements for his release under Article 47 (2) of the Criminal Code were not satisfied.', '23. Mr Herczegfalvy made further applications for release on 6 June and 23 September 1984. He was conditionally released on 28 November in accordance with the court ’ s decision of 14 November, itself based on a psychiatric report dated 14 September (see paragraph 34 below). The court found that the applicant ’ s paranoia had admittedly worsened, but that it was primarily due to his detention ( Haftquerulanz ); the vexatious complaints and petitions ( Rechtsquerulanz ) did not constitute a danger within the meaning of Article 21 of the Criminal Code; since being detained the applicant had behaved with genuine aggressiveness on a few occasions only; although the possibility could not be excluded of his becoming aggressive in the event of frustration, his psychiatric history did not permit the conclusion that his abnormal personality would induce him to commit criminal offences; moreover, continued psychiatric treatment or treatment by drugs was not considered necessary by the expert, although it was recommended.', 'B. The medical treatment', '24. On being returned to prison after his stay in the Vienna psychiatric hospital from 29 June to 23 July 1979 (see paragraph 16 above), Mr Herczegfalvy had begun a hunger strike on 2 August 1979 as a protest against his detention and the refusal to give him his files. He collapsed on 28 August and was transferred to a clinic where he received intensive medical care. On 10 September 1979 he was transferred back to the Vienna psychiatric hospital, where he remained until his release on 28 November 1984 (see paragraph 23 above).', '25. As the applicant was in an extremely weak state when returned there, the director of the hospital ordered him to be force fed, pursuant to section 8 (3) of the Hospitals Law (see paragraph 51 below). The applicant refused all contact and refused to have any medical examination or treatment, and was also given sedatives against his will (three doses of 30mg each of Taractan IM); on 14 and 15 September 1979 he was attached to a security bed, the net and straps of which he succeeded in cutting through. On 17 September he was given a different neuroleptic ( Sordinol IM), as infiltrations had appeared. He stopped refusing food on 27 September 1979, after being allocated a single room and being given some of his files.', '26. Mr Herczegfalvy again went on hunger strike from 26 November to 13 December 1979, on which date he allegedly eventually agreed to be fed through a tube ( Sondenernährung ) once daily. However, he later denied that his consent had been validly given.', '27. In view of the deterioration of his physical and mental state, he was injected by force with 90mg of Taractan on 15 January 1980, in order to bring about a state of somnolence ( Dämmerschlaf ) in which it would be possible to treat him by means of perfusions. Since he had resisted this with violence, the emergency team had had to overpower him. On 18 January he was transferred to the intensive care unit, as he showed symptoms of pneumonia and nephritis; he stayed there until 30 January 1980.', '28. He had not made a complete recovery when he left, and he still needed treatment with antibiotics and neuroleptics. On his return to the closed unit he was handcuffed and a belt placed around his ankles because of the danger of aggression and the death threats he was making; the restraints were not removed until 14 February 1980. According to the Government, their position was changed regularly, in order to avoid nervous paralysis, and on 12 February he had agreed to be fed by a woman doctor. The applicant stated, however, that other belts had been put around his thighs and stomach and had been untied for the first time only on 2 February; in order to obtain his files and writing materials with which to write his complaints, he had continued his hunger strike without interruption, and had been artificially fed throughout this period.', '29. From 19 February 1980 the applicant calmed down and behaved in a more co-operative manner. Although he continued to insult the staff from time to time, he agreed to communicate with those around him and consented to being fed through a tube by a female doctor twice weekly. On 22 February he was given paper and a ballpoint pen.', '30. Following a dispute about his correspondence, Mr Herczegfalvy was forbidden on 27 December 1980 to watch television. As his physical resistance to the forced administration of neuroleptics had frequently been in vain and had even led to injuries (loss of teeth, broken ribs and bruises), he brought a complaint of assault on each occasion that he was given medicaments. These letters, which he claimed had not been communicated to the relevant authorities, filled six binders; they were given to him on his discharge.', '31. During this period he continued to refuse, at least in part, to take nourishment other than through a tube, but on 12 November 1982 he stated that he no longer needed to be fed artificially, as a doctor had persuaded him to end his hunger strike by explaining to him that it was endangering his life. Hospital reports had, however, stated that he appeared to be adequately nourished.', '32. In an opinion of 5 March 1983 an expert considered that conditional release of the applicant would be possible if certain accompanying psychiatric and social measures were taken. In his view, Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s behaviour was much improved, so that there was now virtually no danger.', '33. After a further series of complaints which were regarded as vexatious, the Regional Court consulted the hospital on 28 July 1983 as to the applicant ’ s possible release.', 'On 22 October 1983 an expert noted the progress which the applicant had made and expressed the opinion that troublesome behaviour did not constitute a risk within the meaning of Article 21 of the Criminal Code.', 'However, in a letter of 25 January 1984, the director of the hospital advised the court not to terminate Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s detention; as the treatment carried out, based on medication, had only a sedative effect, the possibility could not be excluded that if he were released, he would again become aggressive and dangerous.', 'The Regional Court thereupon on 16 February 1984 refused to release the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).', '34. He eventually recovered his liberty on 28 November 1984, after a further expert report dated 14 September 1984 (see paragraph 23 above).', 'C. The control of correspondence', '35. While in detention Mr Herczegfalvy addressed an extremely large number of petitions and complaints to various authorities, relating inter alia to his medical treatment and the proceedings brought by him. As he considered that he did not have the necessary money, he refused on several occasions to put stamps on his letters, or sent them to the Ministry of Justice for that purpose. In order to stem this flow of correspondence, he was deprived from time to time of writing materials, and his unstamped letters were frequently returned to him, with the exception of those addressed to the public authorities, in particular the courts.', '36. With respect to the letters written at the psychiatric hospital, the hospital management had agreed with the applicant ’ s curator that they would be transmitted to him regularly and it would be for him to decide whether it was necessary to send them on; this system would apply to all letters other than those to his lawyer, his adviser and the guardianship court. Mr Herczegfalvy has complained that even those letters were not all sent on.', '37. When he left the hospital the applicant was given six binders containing the originals of these letters and also about fifty sealed letters; the postal register showed that the latter had never been sent to their addressees, namely the police, the public prosecutor ’ s office and the courts.', 'D. The restrictions on access to information', '38. Mr Herczegfalvy also claimed that he had been deprived of reading matter, radio and television for long periods during his detention, in particular from 15 January 1980 to the end of February of that year and from 27 December 1980; from 15 June 1981 there had been no television set in his cell or in the ward. He alleged that these measures had been taken for disciplinary purposes only.', '39. According to the Government, these measures were based on section 51 (1) of the Hospitals Law (see paragraph 51 below), had been justified for therapeutic reasons, and had lasted for a short time only on each occasion.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. Deprivation of liberty', '1. Pre-trial detention', '40. Article 180 (1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the version in force at the time, permits the pre-trial detention of a person (where there are serious reasons for suspecting him of having committed a criminal offence) if there is a danger of absconding, collusion or repetition of offences.', '41. The risk of absconding cannot be presumed if the accused is liable to a penalty of not more than five years ’ imprisonment, is living in normal conditions and has a permanent address in Austria, unless he has already attempted to abscond (Article 180 (3)).', '42. The accused can bring an application for release at any time (Article 194 (2)). Under Articles 194 and 195 the request is examined by the Review Chamber of the Regional Court at a hearing in private, in the presence of the accused or his lawyer. If the accused or the public prosecutor ’ s office appeals to the Court of Appeal, the hearing also takes place in private, in the presence of a member of the principal public prosecutor ’ s office, but in the absence of the accused and his lawyer.', 'If no such application is made by the accused, the Review Chamber of its own motion reviews the detention when it has lasted for two months or where three months have passed since the last hearing and the accused has no lawyer (Article 194 (3)).', 'After the definitive indictment or the fixing of the hearing date for the trial, these review hearings cease. Decisions on the continuation of the detention are now taken by the trial court during the hearing and by the Review Chamber, sitting in private, at other times (Article 194 (4)).', '43. Detention on remand is terminated at the latest at the time when a person who has been convicted begins to serve his sentence; the time spent in detention on remand is automatically deducted from the sentence (Article 38 of the Criminal Code).', '2. Provisional placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders', '44. In two cases specified in Articles 429 (4) and 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, pre-trial detention may take the form of placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders:', 'Article 429 (4)', '""If one of the reasons for detention specified in Article 180 (2) or (7) exists, or if the person concerned cannot remain at liberty without there being a danger for himself or other persons, or if medical observation of him is necessary, an order shall be made for his provisional detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders or for his admission to a public hospital for mental illnesses ...""', 'Article 438', '""If there are sufficient reasons for presuming that the conditions in [Article] 21 (2) ... of the Criminal Code are fulfilled, and if reasons for detention (Article 180 (2) and (7)) exist, but the accused cannot without difficulty be detained in the prison of a court, an order shall be made that detention on remand is to take the form of provisional placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders ...""', '3. Placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders (preventive measures)', '45. Under Article 21 of the Criminal Code:', '""(1) If a person commits an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and if he cannot be punished for the sole reason that he committed the offence under the influence of a state of mind excluding responsibility (Article 11) resulting from a serious mental or emotional abnormality, the court shall order him to be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders, if in view of his person, his condition and the nature of the offence it is to be feared that he will otherwise, under the influence of his mental or emotional abnormality, commit a criminal offence with serious consequences.', '(2) If such a fear exists, an order for placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders shall also be made in respect of a person who, while not lacking responsibility, commits an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding one year under the influence of his severe mental or emotional abnormality. In such a case the placement is to be ordered at the same time as the sentence is passed.""', '46. The duration of these preventive measures is governed by Article 25 of the Criminal Code, which states that:', '""(1) Preventive measures are to be ordered for an indefinite period. They are to be implemented for as long as is required by their purpose ...', '(2) The termination of preventive measures shall be decided by the court.', '(3) The court must of its own motion examine at least once yearly whether the placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders ... is still necessary.', '...""', 'B. Conditions of detention', '1. Rules governing pre-trial detention', '47. Article 184 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that:', '""Pre-trial detention is intended to counteract the dangers specified in Article 180 (2). In accordance with the statutory provisions and the regulations based thereon, persons in pre-trial detention may be subjected to restrictions only if they serve the purposes of detention or the maintenance of security or order in the institutions. Prisoners in pre-trial detention are to be treated with calm, seriousness and firmness, in a just manner and with respect for their sense of honour, human dignity and with as little as possible interference with their personality.""', '48. Articles 187 and 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure govern the correspondence of prisoners in pre-trial detention:', 'Article 187', '""(1) Prisoners in pre-trial detention may, without prejudice to Article 45 of this Code and sections 85 and 88 of the Law on Enforcement of Sentences, correspond in writing with all persons who are not likely to prejudice the purpose of the pre-trial detention, and to receive visits from such persons.', '(2) Correspondence shall not be subject to any restrictions, unless surveillance is prejudiced by the exceptional volume of the correspondence of a prisoner in pre-trial detention. In such a case the restrictions which are necessary for proper surveillance shall be ordered. Letters which are likely to prejudice the purpose of the detention are to be withheld, unless provided otherwise by sections 88 and 90 (4) of the Law on Enforcement of Sentences, relating to written correspondence with official bodies and legal advisers. Letters from prisoners in pre-trial detention which give rise to suspicion that an offence, not being an offence which can be prosecuted only at the request of a person concerned, is being committed by means of them, are always to be stopped, unless they are addressed to a national general representative body, a national court or another national authority, or to the European Commission of Human Rights.', '...""', 'Article 188 (1)', '""Decisions as to which persons prisoners in pre-trial detention may correspond in writing with and which visits they may receive, surveillance of correspondence and visits, and all other orders and decisions relating to contacts between prisoners in pre-trial detention and the outside world (sections 86-100 of the Law on Enforcement of Sentences) are to be taken by the investigating judge, with the exception of surveillance of parcels. Surveillance of correspondence can be waived only in so far as no prejudice of the purpose of detention is to be feared as a result thereof.""', '2. Rules relating to institutions for mentally ill offenders', '49. Unless provided otherwise, the provisions of the Law on Enforcement of Sentences ( Strafvollzugsgesetz ) applicable to persons in prison also apply by analogy to persons placed in institutions for mentally ill offenders (section 167 (1) of that law). They lay down detailed regulations, for example, with respect to:', '- the right to necessary medical treatment (sections 66 et seq.), and compulsory medical treatment and force-feeding (section 69);', '- the right of access to information by means of books, magazines, newspapers, radio and television (sections 58 et seq.);', '- the right of correspondence, in particular with close relatives and other persons, lawyers, courts and other authorities, representative bodies, the ombudsman, the European Commission of Human Rights and, in the case of a foreign national, his consulate (sections 86 et seq.);', '- the right to bring petitions and complaints (sections 119 et seq.). Prisoners may submit petitions concerning their conditions of imprisonment (section 119) and complain of actions of the prison staff which in their opinion infringe their rights (section 120). Complaints are to be addressed to the governor of the prison or, where the complaint is brought against the governor, to the Federal Ministry of Justice (section 121); this remains subject to review by the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court (Articles 130 and 144 of the Federal Constitution).', 'Prisoners may submit petitions and requests, other than those relating to their medical treatment, by means of an application to a higher official, but this does not give the right to an administrative decision (section 120 (1), second sentence, and section 122).', '50. Section 165 (1) authorises restrictions on the rights of mentally ill offenders only to the extent necessary for the attainment of the purpose of the detention, and prohibits all interferences with their human dignity and with the rights guaranteed them by sections 119 to 122. It also provides that complaints which have obviously been brought solely because of the detainee ’ s mental or emotional disturbance and which are not based on an infringement of his rights shall be rejected without any formal procedure.', '3. Rules relating to the closed units of psychiatric hospitals', '51. Before the establishment of special institutions for mentally ill offenders, they were placed in closed units of public psychiatric hospitals, regulated by the Hospitals Law ( Krankenanstaltengesetz ). That law provides inter alia:', 'Section 8', '""(1) The medical service must be organised in such a way that medical assistance is always immediately available in the hospital.', '(2) Hospital patients may be medically treated only in accordance with the principles and recognised methods of medical science.', '(3) Special curative treatments including surgical operations may be carried out on a patient only with his consent, but if the patient has not yet reached the age of eighteen or if because he lacks mental maturity or health he cannot assess the necessity or usefulness of the treatment, only with the consent of his legal representative. Consent is not required if the treatment is so urgently necessary that the delay involved in obtaining the consent of the patient or his legal representative or in appointing a legal representative would endanger his life or would entail the danger of serious harm to his health. The medical director of the hospital or the doctor responsible for the management of the hospital department concerned shall decide on the necessity and urgency of treatment.""', 'Section 51 (1)', '""Patients who are compulsorily detained ... may be subjected to restrictions with respect to freedom of movement or contact with the outside world.""', 'C. Lack of legal capacity', '52. The applicant ’ s partial legal incapacitation, which was pronounced in 1975 (see paragraph 10 above), was based on sections 1 (2) and 4 of the Incapacitation Regulations ( Entmündigungsordnung ) of 1916:', 'Section 1 (2)', '""Adults who are unable to look after their own affairs and, because of a mental illness or a handicap, need the assistance of an adviser ( Beistand ) to look after their affairs appropriately, may be declared partially incapacitated.""', 'Section 4', '""(1) A person who is partially incapacitated shall be treated as a minor over fourteen years ( mündiger Minderjähriger ) and shall be given an adviser.', '...', '(3) The adviser shall have the rights and duties of a guardian ( Vormund ), but the guardianship court may reserve to the adviser the right to dispose over what the incapacitated person acquires by his work.""', '53. The functions of a guardian are defined in Article 188, first sentence, of the Civil Code ( Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ), which reads as follows:', '""A guardian must primarily take care of the person of the minor, but also administer his property.""', 'Article 216 (1) states that if care for the person and education of a minor is not the responsibility of a person having parental authority, the guardian shall have responsibility therefor.', '54. Under the Law of 1983 on the appointment of curators of handicapped persons ( Sachwaltergesetz ), persons who have been declared totally or partly legally incapacitated are to be regarded from 1 July 1984 as having the assistance of a curator ( Sachwalter ), empowered under Article 273 (3), sub-paragraph 3, of the Civil Code to look after all their affairs.', 'Under Article 282 of the Civil Code a curator has the same rights and obligations as a guardian, but must also care for the person of a handicapped person, in particular his medical and social treatment, unless a court decides otherwise.', 'D. Applications to the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court', '55. Any administrative act, including the exercise of direct administrative compulsion against a particular person, may in principle be challenged as to its lawfulness before the Administrative Court ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof, Article 130 of the Federal Constitution) and as to its constitutionality before the Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof, Article 144).', 'However, there does not appear to be any example in the case-law of such an application against the acts of a psychiatric hospital of the type of those in issue in the present case.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '56. In his application of 27 November 1978 to the Commission (no. 10533/83) Mr Herczegfalvy brought a series of complaints relating to the lawfulness, length and conditions of his detention and the medical treatment carried out during it.', '57. On 10 March 1988 the Commission inter alia declared inadmissible as out of time (Article 26 in fine of the Convention) (art. 26) the complaints relating to facts prior to 27 May 1978. On 4 October 1989 it declared certain of the other complaints admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 1 March 1991 (made under Article 31) (art. 31) it expressed the opinion that there had been violations of Article 3 (art. 3) (unanimously), Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) for the periods from 11 December 1981 to 8 February 1982 and from 8 February 1983 to 16 February 1984 (unanimously), Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) (unanimously), Article 8 (art. 8) (unanimously), Article 10 (art. 10) (unanimously) and Article 13 (art. 13) (eighteen votes to two), but not of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) (eleven votes to nine), Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) for the other periods (eleven votes to nine) or Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) (unanimously). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 1 (art. 5-1)', 'A. Introduction', '58. The applicant claimed there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), according to which:', '""Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:', '(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;', '...', '(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;', '...', '(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;', '...""', '59. In view of the Commission ’ s decisions on admissibility (see paragraphs 56-57 above), the detention to be taken into consideration commenced on 27 May 1978. As its legal basis changed over the years, it is necessary to distinguish between various periods.', 'B. 27 May 1978 to 10 January 1979', '60. From 27 May 1978 to 10 January 1979 the detention in issue, based in turn on Article 438 and Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 44 above), had as its purpose to ensure that Mr Herczegfalvy would appear before the Regional Court (see paragraphs 11-12 above). It therefore came under paragraph 1 (c) of Article 5 (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention, and this was indeed not disputed by any of those appearing before the Court.', '61. The case-file does not reveal any shortcomings at this stage. Thus there is nothing to show that the judicial authorities failed to observe the procedures of national law when ordering Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s pre-trial detention and subsequent placement or when confirming these two measures (see paragraphs 11-13 above). As for the reasons put forward in support - the suspicion against him and the risks of repetition of offences and absconding - the Court sees nothing to suggest that they were not well-founded, especially in the light of the applicant ’ s aggressive behaviour and the nature of the offences he was charged with.', 'C. 10 January to 3 October 1979', '62. The second period consists of the time during which the application for the declaration of nullity directed against the first detention order was before the Supreme Court, namely from 10 January to 3 October 1979. Although under Austrian law the detention was still pre-trial detention (see paragraph 15 above), it now came under paragraph 1 (e) alone of Article 5 (art. 5-1-e), as the Regional Court had not convicted or sentenced Mr Herczegfalvy in view of his lack of criminal responsibility (see paragraph 14 above; and see inter alia the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 17-18, para. 39, and the B. v. Austria judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 175, pp. 14-15, paras. 36 and 38).', '63. In order to comply with paragraph 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e), the detention in issue must first of all be ""lawful"", including the observance of a procedure prescribed by law; in this respect the Convention refers back essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. It requires in addition, however, that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see inter alia the van der Leer v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170-A, p. 12, para. 22, and the Wassink v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 185-A, p. 11, para. 24). Consequently, in order to justify detention, the fact that a person is ""of unsound mind"" must be established conclusively, except in case of emergency. To this end an objective medical report must demonstrate to the competent national authority the existence of genuine mental disturbance whose nature or extent is such as to justify such deprivation of liberty, which cannot be extended unless the mental disturbance continues.', 'It must, however, be acknowledged that the national authorities have a certain discretion when deciding whether a person is to be detained as ""of unsound mind"", as it is for them in the first place to evaluate the evidence put before them in a particular case; the Court ’ s task is to review their decisions from the point of view of the Convention (see the Winterwerp v. the Netherlands judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 18, paras. 39-40, and the Wassink judgment cited above, Series A no. 185-A, p. 11, para. 25).', '64. In the present case the Court does not consider that the Austrian courts failed to comply with the relevant national law, in particular Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which continued to serve as a basis for the detention in question (see paragraphs 15-17 above). Nor does the detention appear to have been tainted by arbitrariness, as when the Regional Court took its decision on 10 January 1979 it had before it three expert reports which concluded unanimously that the applicant was suffering from paranoia querulans which was serious enough to be equivalent to a mental illness and dangerous for those around him (see paragraphs 14-15 above), this also being confirmed by the applicant ’ s previous convictions (see paragraph 9 above).', 'No violation of paragraph 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) has thus been shown to exist at this stage.', 'D. 3 October 1979 to 9 April 1980', '65. On 3 October 1979, following the Supreme Court ’ s judgment quashing the detention order (see paragraph 18 above), the impugned deprivation of liberty once more came under paragraph 1 (c), until the Regional Court ’ s decision of 9 April 1980 (see paragraph 20 above).', 'During this period the detention remained based on Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, compliance with which is not in dispute. The risk of repetition of offences was still capable of justifying Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s detention, having regard in particular to the further verbal attacks made by him (see paragraph 20 above). Accordingly, there was no violation of paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).', 'E. 9 April 1980 to 28 November 1984', '66. The judgment of 9 April 1980 ordering the applicant to be detained in hospital again (see paragraph 20 above) opened a new period of his detention, which lasted until his release on 28 November 1984 (see paragraph 23 above). It came under Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) alone, as the court had not found the applicant guilty (see paragraphs 20 and 62 above).', 'It was initially governed by Article 429 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and then by Article 25 (1) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 46 above) once the final order of 6 November 1980 had been made (see paragraph 20 above). Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s subsequent repudiation of his declarations which gave rise to the order makes no difference; the order in itself gave final and binding effect to the said judgment of 9 April 1980; moreover, it was not challenged (see paragraph 20 above).', '67. The applicant alleged that there had been various breaches of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) during this period. Firstly, there had on two occasions been a failure to carry out the annual review by the court of its own motion, as required by Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 21-22 and 46 above). Secondly, he claimed that his state of health had improved to the extent that it no longer justified his detention; the last act of physical aggression recorded was on 9 July 1981, and one of the psychiatrists consulted by the court had recommended his release in March 1983.', '68. The Court notes that before extending the detention in issue on 8 February 1982 and 16 February 1984 the Regional Court had consulted several experts. One of them had on 22 October 1983 recommended that the applicant should be released under psychiatric supervision, but all the others had been of the opinion that his aggressive tendencies still justified his detention, especially as it was to be feared that if released he would refuse to accept treatment even though it was necessary (see paragraphs 21-22 above).', 'Furthermore, there is nothing in the case-file to support Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s claim that his querulous behaviour was the sole reason for the measures complained of. Consequently, the Court cannot regard them as arbitrary.', 'The complaints based on the failure to comply with Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code will be examined by the Court from the point of view of paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. There is therefore no need to examine them from the point of view of paragraph 1 (art. 5-1) as well.', 'F. Conclusion', '69. In conclusion, no violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) has been established.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 3 (art. 5-3)', '70. Mr Herczegfalvy also relied on Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), according to which:', '""Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) ... shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.""', 'He claimed that the length of his pre-trial detention had exceeded the limits laid down in this paragraph.', '71. The periods to be taken into consideration are those from 27 May 1978 to 10 January 1979 and from 3 October 1979 to 9 April 1980. The Court refers to its observations relating to Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraphs 59-61 and 65 above).', 'The Court has already stated that the reasons which the Austrian courts regarded as justifying the detention in question were ""relevant"" and ""sufficient""; it therefore remains to be ascertained whether the authorities displayed ""special diligence"" in the conduct of the proceedings (see, as the most recent authority, the Tomasi v. France judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A, p. 35, para. 84).', '72. The first period lasted for seven months and fifteen days, but at its commencement on 27 May 1978 the applicant had already been deprived of his liberty from 13 May 1977, in other words for over one year (see paragraph 11 above).', 'He did not dispute the Commission ’ s findings relating to this period of detention (see paragraphs 33-50 of the report). Nor does the Court find any negligence on the part of the authorities between 27 May 1978 and 10 January 1979 such as to delay the proceedings to the point of violating the Convention. Moreover, the applicant himself contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings, in particular by the incident caused by him and involving the President of the Regional Court (see paragraphs 13-14 above).', 'As for the period from 3 October 1979 to 9 April 1980, this does not appear excessive, bearing in mind inter alia the different composition of the court to which the case had been remitted by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above).', '73. In short, there was no violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 4 (art. 5-4)', '74. The applicant further complained of a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4), which provides that:', '""Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.""', 'He claimed that the decisions of the Austrian courts under Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 46 above) had not been given ""speedily"".', 'The Government disputed this argument; the Commission agreed with it in essence.', '75. The procedure provided for in Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code amounts to an automatic periodic review of a judicial character (see inter alia the X v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, Series A no. 46, p. 23, para. 52).', 'According to the Court ’ s case-law on the scope of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-4) of the Convention, in order to satisfy the requirements of the Convention such a review must comply with both the substantive and procedural rules of the national legislation and moreover be conducted in conformity with the aim of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect the individual against arbitrariness. The latter condition implies not only that the competent courts must decide ""speedily"" (see the Koendjbiharie v. the Netherlands judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 185-B, p. 40, para. 27), but also that their decisions must follow at reasonable intervals. The latter point should be considered first, bearing in mind that the intention of the Austrian legislature was that the interval should not exceed one year.', '76. The only complaints under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) which are admissible are those relating to the period after 9 April 1980, as the Commission on 4 October 1989 declared the other complaints manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (art. 27-2).', '77. In this case the three decisions taken under Article 25 (3) of the Criminal Code were taken at intervals of fifteen months (6 November 1980 - 8 February 1982), two years (8 February 1982 - 16 February 1984) and nine months (16 February 1984 - 14 November 1984) respectively. The first two decisions cannot be regarded as having been taken at reasonable intervals, especially as the numerous requests for release submitted at that time by Mr Herczegfalvy brought no response (see paragraphs 20-23 above).', 'These conclusions mean that there is no need for the Court to examine whether the decisions in issue complied with national law.', '78. In short, there was a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).', 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 (art. 3)', '79. Mr Herczegfalvy also complained of his medical treatment. In that he had been forcibly administered food and neuroleptics, isolated and attached with handcuffs to a security bed during the weeks following the incident of 15 January 1980 (see paragraphs 24-28 above), he had been subjected to brutal treatment incompatible with Article 3 (art. 3), according to which:', '""No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""', '80. The Commission considered that the manner in which the treatment was administered had not complied with the requirements of Article 3 (art. 3): the various measures complained of had been violent and excessively prolonged, and taken together had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, and even contributed to the worsening of the patient ’ s condition.', '81. In the Government ’ s opinion, on the other hand, the measures were essentially the consequence of the applicant ’ s behaviour, as he had refused medical treatment which was urgent in view of the deterioration in his physical and mental health.', 'Thus when Mr Herczegfalvy returned to the hospital on 10 September 1979 it proved to be necessary to feed him artificially, in view of his extremely weak state caused by his refusal to take any food (see paragraphs 24-25 above). Later on, it was partly at his own request that he was fed through a tube, while continuing - at least ostensibly - with his hunger strike.', 'Similarly, it was only his resistance to all treatment, his extreme aggressiveness and the threats and acts of violence on his part against the hospital staff which explained why the staff had used coercive measures including the intramuscular injection of sedatives and the use of handcuffs and the security bed. These measures had been agreed to by Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s curator, their sole aim had always been therapeutic, and they had been terminated as soon as the state of the patient permitted this.', 'Finally, the Government claimed that the isolation complained of had in fact consisted of being placed in an individual cell, in accordance with Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s wishes. He had had contact with doctors and nurses, and had been able to receive visits and even walk in the garden.', '82. The Court considers that the position of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with. While it is for the medical authorities to decide, on the basis of the recognised rules of medical science, on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves and for whom they are therefore responsible, such patients nevertheless remain under the protection of Article 3 (art. 3), whose requirements permit of no derogation.', 'The established principles of medicine are admittedly in principle decisive in such cases; as a general rule, a measure which is a therapeutic necessity cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading. The Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist.', '83. In this case it is above all the length of time during which the handcuffs and security bed were used (see paragraphs 27-28 above) which appears worrying. However, the evidence before the Court is not sufficient to disprove the Government ’ s argument that, according to the psychiatric principles generally accepted at the time, medical necessity justified the treatment in issue. Moreover, certain of the applicant ’ s allegations are not supported by the evidence. This is the case in particular with those relating to what happened on 15 January 1980 (see paragraph 27 above) and the extent of the isolation.', '84. No violation of Article 3 (art. 3) has thus been shown.', 'V. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8)', '85. Mr Herczegfalvy further alleged that by administering food to him by force, imposing on him the treatment complained of and refusing to send on his correspondence, the hospital authorities had also violated Article 8 (art. 8), which reads as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', '86. The first two complaints relate to facts already complained of from the point of view of Article 3 (art. 3). Reference should therefore first be made to paragraph 83 above. In addition, the Court attaches decisive weight here to the lack of specific information capable of disproving the Government ’ s opinion that the hospital authorities were entitled to regard the applicant ’ s psychiatric illness as rendering him entirely incapable of taking decisions for himself. Consequently, no violation of Article 8 (art. 8) has been shown in this respect.', '87. The third and last complaint is directed in particular against the psychiatric hospital ’ s practice of sending all the applicant ’ s letters to the curator for him to select which ones to pass on (see paragraph 36 above).', 'The Government conceded that this was an interference with the exercise of Mr Herczegfalvy ’ s right to respect for his correspondence, but maintained that it had been justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2), as its essential purpose had been to protect his health.', '88. This interference constituted a breach of Article 8 (art. 8), unless it was ""in accordance with the law"", pursued a legitimate aim or aims under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2), and was moreover ""necessary in a democratic society"" for achieving those aims.', 'The Court recalls that the expression ""in accordance with the law"" requires firstly that the impugned measure should have some basis in national law; it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law (see, inter alia, the Kruslin and Huvig v. France judgments of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, p. 20, paras. 26-27, and no. 176-B, p. 52, paras. 25-26).', '89. While there can be no doubt as to the existence of a legal basis and the accessibility of the law in this case, this is not true of the requirement of foreseeability of the law as to the meaning and nature of the applicable measures.', 'Compatibility with the rule of law implies that there must be a measure of protection in national law against arbitrary interferences with the rights safeguarded by paragraph 1 (art. 8-1). If a law confers a discretion on a public authority, it must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the degree of precision required will depend upon the particular subject matter (see, inter alia, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 33, para. 88; the Malone v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, pp. 32-33, paras. 67-68; and the Kruslin and Huvig judgments cited above, Series A no. 176-A, pp. 22-23, para. 30, and no. 176-B, pp. 54-55, para. 29).', '90. The Government argued that the impugned decisions were based directly on section 51 (1) of the Hospitals Law and Articles 216 and 282 of the Civil Code, to which should be added section 8 (2) of the Hospitals Law and sections 3 and 4 of the Incapacitation Regulations (see paragraphs 51-54 above).', '91. These very vaguely worded provisions do not specify the scope or conditions of exercise of the discretionary power which was at the origin of the measures complained of. But such specifications appear all the more necessary in the field of detention in psychiatric institutions in that the persons concerned are frequently at the mercy of the medical authorities, so that their correspondence is their only contact with the outside world.', 'Admittedly, as the Court has previously stated, it would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality (see, inter alia, the Silver and Others judgment cited above, Series A no. 61, p. 33, para. 88). For all that, in the absence of any detail at all as to the kind of restrictions permitted or their purpose, duration and extent or the arrangements for their review, the above provisions do not offer the minimum degree of protection against arbitrariness required by the rule of law in a democratic society. According to the information provided to the Court, there has been no case-law to remedy this state of affairs. There has therefore been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention.', '92. This being so, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine in this case whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) were complied with.', 'VI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '93. The applicant maintained that the restrictions on his access to information (see paragraph 38 above) had breached Article 10 (art. 10).', 'The Government conceded that there had been interferences, but argued that they had been based on section 51 (1) of the Hospitals Law and had come under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) of the Convention.', '94. The Court has already stated the reasons for which it is unable to regard section 51 (1) of that law as ""law"" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) (see paragraph 91 above). As there are no grounds for a different conclusion here, there has also been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). Consequently, it is not necessary to examine the other requirements of paragraph 2 of that Article (art. 10-2).', 'VII. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13)', '95. Mr Herczegfalvy complained, finally, that there had been a breach of Article 13 (art. 13), in that he had not had an effective national remedy in respect of the violations of the Convention complained of.', '96. The Court does not consider it necessary to rule on this point, in view of its decision with respect to Articles 8 and 10 (art. 8, art. 10) (see paragraphs 91 and 94 above).', 'VIII. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '97. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'The applicant put forward claims under this Article (art. 50) for the award of pecuniary compensation and reimbursement of costs and expenses.', '98. Mr Herczegfalvy left it to the Court to assess the non-pecuniary damage suffered. As a guide, he estimated it at 2,737,753,802 Austrian schillings and 45 groschen for the period from 15 May 1972 to 1 December 1979, and produced a calculation in support of this.', 'In respect of his costs of representation before the Convention institutions, he sought DEM 8,000 and ATS 12,000, for lawyer ’ s fees and travelling expenses respectively.', '99. The Government described the amounts claimed in respect of damage as exorbitant and unrealistic; the Commission expressed no opinion.', '100. Taking a decision on an equitable basis, the Court assesses the damage resulting from the violations found at ATS 100,000. It orders the costs to be reimbursed in full, less FRF 22,971 already paid by the Council of Europe as legal aid.']",2,at,001-57781,1

The applicants in this case are (a) Open Door Counselling Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Open Door), a company incorporated under Irish law, which was engaged, inter alia, in counselling pregnant women in Dublin and in other parts of Ireland; and (b) Dublin Well Woman Centre Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Dublin Well Woman), a company also incorporated under Irish law which provided similar services at two clinics in Dublin; (c) Bonnie Maher and Ann Downes, who worked as trained counsellors for Dublin Well Woman; (d) Mrs X, born in 1950 and Ms Maeve Geraghty, born in 1970, who join in the Dublin Well Woman application as women of child-bearing age. The applicants complained of an injunction imposed by the Irish courts on Open Door and Dublin Well Woman to restrain them from providing certain information to pregnant women concerning abortion facilities outside the jurisdiction of Ireland by way of non-directive counselling (see paragraphs 13 and 20 below).', 'Open Door and Dublin Well Woman are both non-profit- making organisations. Open Door ceased to operate in 1988 (see paragraph 21 below). Dublin Well Woman was established in 1977 and provides a broad range of services relating to counselling and marriage, family planning, procreation and health matters. The services offered by Dublin Well Woman relate to every aspect of women ’ s health, ranging from smear tests to breast examinations, infertility, artificial insemination and the counselling of pregnant women.', '10. In 1983, at the time of the referendum leading to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (see paragraph 28 below), Dublin Well Woman issued a pamphlet stating inter alia that legal advice on the implications of the wording of the provision had been obtained and that ""with this wording anybody could seek a court injunction to prevent us offering"" the non-directive counselling service. The pamphlet also warned that ""it would also be possible for an individual to seek a court injunction to prevent a woman travelling abroad if they believe she intends to have an abortion"".', 'B. The injunction proceedings', '1. Before the High Court', '11. The applicant companies were the defendants in proceedings before the High Court which were commenced on 28 June 1985 as a private action brought by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as S.P.U.C.), which was converted into a relator action brought at the suit of the Attorney General by order of the High Court of 24 September 1986 (the Attorney General at the relation of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd v. Open Door Counselling Ltd and Dublin Well Woman Centre Ltd [1988] Irish Reports, pp. 593-627).', '12. S.P.U.C. sought a declaration that the activities of the applicant companies in counselling pregnant women within the jurisdiction of the court to travel abroad to obtain an abortion were unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3 o of the Constitution which protects the right to life of the unborn (see paragraph 28 below) and an order restraining the defendants from such counselling or assistance.', '13. No evidence was adduced at the hearing of the action which proceeded on the basis of certain agreed facts. The facts as agreed at that time by Dublin Well Woman may be summarised as follows:', '(a) It counsels in a non-directive manner pregnant women resident in Ireland;', '(b) Abortion or termination of pregnancy may be one of the options discussed within the said counselling;', '(c) If a pregnant woman wants to consider the abortion option further, arrangements will be made by the applicant to refer her to a medical clinic in Great Britain;', '(d) In certain circumstances, the applicant may arrange for the travel of such pregnant women;', '(e) The applicant will inspect the medical clinic in Great Britain to ensure that it operates at the highest standards;', '(f) At those medical clinics abortions have been performed on pregnant women who have been previously counselled by the applicant;', '(g) Pregnant women resident in Ireland have been referred to medical clinics in Great Britain where abortions have been performed for many years including 1984.', 'The facts agreed by Open Door were the same as above with the exception of point (d).', '14. The meaning of the concept of non-directive counselling was described in the following terms by Mr Justice Finlay CJ in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case (judgment of 16 March 1988, [1988] Irish Reports 618 at p. 621):', '""It was submitted on behalf of each of the Defendants that the meaning of non-directive counselling in these agreed sets of facts was that it was counselling which neither included advice nor was judgmental but that it was a service essentially directed to eliciting from the client her own appreciation of her problem and her own considered choice for its solution. This interpretation of the phrase ‘ non-directive counselling ’ in the context of the activities of the Defendants was not disputed on behalf of the Respondent. It follows from this, of course, that non- directive counselling to pregnant women would never involve the actual advising of an abortion as the preferred option but neither, of course, could it permit the giving of advice for any reason to the pregnant women receiving such counselling against choosing to have an abortion.""', '15. On 19 December 1986 Mr Justice Hamilton, President of the High Court, found that the activities of Open Door and Dublin Well Woman in counselling pregnant women within the jurisdiction of the court to travel abroad to obtain an abortion or to obtain further advice on abortion within a foreign jurisdiction were unlawful having regard to the provisions of Article 40.3.3 o of the Constitution of Ireland.', 'He confirmed that Irish criminal law made it an offence to procure or attempt to procure an abortion, to administer an abortion or to assist in an abortion by supplying any noxious thing or instrument (sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 - see paragraph 29 below). Furthermore, Irish constitutional law also protected the right to life of the unborn from the moment of conception onwards.', 'An injunction was accordingly granted ""... that the Defendants [Open Door and Dublin Well Woman] and each of them, their servants or agents, be perpetually restrained from counselling or assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction of this Court to obtain further advice on abortion or to obtain an abortion"". The High Court made no order relating to the costs of the proceedings, leaving each side to bear its own legal costs.', '2. Before the Supreme Court', '16. Open Door and Dublin Well Woman appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court which in a unanimous judgment delivered on 16 March 1988 by Mr Justice Finlay CJ rejected the appeal.', 'The Supreme Court noted that the appellants did not consider it essential to the service which they provided for pregnant women in Ireland that they should take any part in arranging the travel of women who wished to go abroad for the purpose of having an abortion or that they arranged bookings in clinics for such women. However, they did consider it essential to inform women who wished to have an abortion outside the jurisdiction of the court of the name, address, telephone number and method of communication with a specified clinic which they had examined and were satisfied was one which maintained a high standard.', '17. On the question of whether the above activity should be restrained as being contrary to the Constitution, Mr Justice Finlay CJ stated:', '""... the essential issues in this case do not in any way depend upon the Plaintiff establishing that the Defendants were advising or encouraging the procuring of abortions. The essential issue in this case, having regard to the nature of the guarantees contained in Article 40, s.3, sub-s.3 of the Constitution, is the issue as to whether the Defendants ’ admitted activities were assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel outside that jurisdiction in order to have an abortion. To put the matter in another way, the issue and the question of fact to be determined is: were they thus assisting in the destruction of the life of the unborn?', 'I am satisfied beyond doubt that having regard to the admitted facts the Defendants were assisting in the ultimate destruction of the life of the unborn by abortion in that they were helping the pregnant woman who had decided upon that option to get in touch with a clinic in Great Britain which would provide the service of abortion. It seems to me an inescapable conclusion that if a woman was anxious to obtain an abortion and if she was able by availing of the counselling services of one or other of the Defendants to obtain the precise location, address and telephone number of, and method of communication with, a clinic in Great Britain which provided that service, put in plain language, that was knowingly helping her to attain her objective. I am, therefore, satisfied that the finding made by the learned trial Judge that the Defendants were assisting pregnant women to travel abroad to obtain further advice on abortion and to secure an abortion is well supported on the evidence ...""', 'The Court further noted that the phrase in Article 40.3.3 o ""with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother"" did not arise for interpretation in the case since the applicants were not claiming that the service they were providing for pregnant women was ""in any way confined to or especially directed towards the due regard to the equal right to life of the mother ..."".', '18. Open Door and Dublin Well Woman had submitted that if they did not provide this counselling service it was likely that pregnant women would succeed nevertheless in obtaining an abortion in circumstances less advantageous to their health. The Court rejected this argument in the following terms:', '""Even if it could be established, however, it would not be a valid reason why the Court should not restrain the activities in which the defendants were engaged.', 'The function of the courts, which is not dependent on the existence of legislation, when their jurisdiction to defend and vindicate a constitutionally guaranteed right has been invoked, must be confined to the issues and to the parties before them.', 'If the Oireachtas enacts legislation to defend and vindicate a constitutionally guaranteed right it may well do so in wider terms than are necessary for the resolution of any individual case. The courts cannot take that wide approach. They are confined to dealing with the parties and issues before them. I am satisfied, therefore, that it is no answer to the making of an order restraining these defendants ’ activities that there may be other persons or the activities of other groups or bodies which will provide the same result as that assisted by these defendants ’ activities.""', '19. As to whether there was a constitutional right to information about the availability of abortion outside the State, the court stated as follows:', '""The performing of an abortion on a pregnant woman terminates the unborn life which she is carrying. Within the terms of Article 40.3.3 o it is a direct destruction of the constitutionally guaranteed right to life of that unborn child.', 'It must follow from this that there could not be an implied and unenumerated constitutional right to information about the availability of a service of abortion outside the State which, if availed of, would have the direct consequence of destroying the expressly guaranteed constitutional right to life of the unborn. As part of the submission on this issue it was further suggested that the right to receive and give information which, it was alleged, existed and was material to this case was, though not expressly granted, impliedly referred to or involved in the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions provided by Article 40, s.6, sub-s.1 ( i ) of the Constitution, since, it was claimed, the right to express freely convictions and opinions may, under some circumstances, involve as an ancillary right the right to obtain information. I am satisfied that no right could constitutionally arise to obtain information the purpose of the obtaining of which was to defeat the constitutional right to life of the unborn child.""', '20. The court upheld the decision of the High Court to grant an injunction but varied the terms of the order as follows:', '""... that the defendants and each of them, their servants or agents be perpetually restrained from assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel abroad to obtain abortions by referral to a clinic, by the making for them of travel arrangements, or by informing them of the identity and location of and the method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics or otherwise.""', 'The costs of the Supreme Court appeal were awarded against the applicant companies on 3 May 1988.', '21. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court, Open Door, having no assets, ceased its activities.', 'C. Subsequent legal developments', '22. On 25 September 1989 S.P.U.C. applied to the High Court for a declaration that the dissemination in certain student publications of information concerning the identity and location of abortion clinics outside the jurisdiction was unlawful and for an injunction restraining its distribution. Their standing to apply to the courts for measures to protect the right to life of the unborn had previously been recognised by the Supreme Court following a similar action in the case of Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd v. Coogan and Others ([1989] Irish Reports, pp. 734-751).', 'By a judgment of 11 October 1989 the High Court decided to refer certain questions to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling under Article 177 of the EEC Treaty concerning, inter alia, the question whether the right to information concerning abortion services outside Ireland was protected by Community law.', '23. An appeal was brought against this decision and, on 19 December 1989, the Supreme Court granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the students from ""publishing or distributing or assisting in the printing, publishing or distribution of any publication produced under their aegis providing information to persons (including pregnant women) of the identity and location of and the method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics where abortions are performed"" (Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd v. Stephen Grogan and Others, [1989] Irish Reports, pp. 753-771).', 'Mr Justice Finlay CJ (with whom Mr Justice Walsh, Mr Justice Griffin and Mr Justice Hederman concurred) considered that the reasoning of the court in the case brought against the applicant companies applied to the activities of the students:', '""I reject as unsound the contention that the activity involved in this case of publishing in the students ’ manuals the name, address and telephone number, when telephoned from this State, of abortion clinics in the United Kingdom, and distributing such manuals in Ireland, can be distinguished from the activity condemned by this Court in [the Open Door Counselling case] on the grounds that the facts of that case were that the information was conveyed during periods of one to one non-directive counselling. It is clearly the fact that such information is conveyed to pregnant women, and not the method of communication which creates the unconstitutional illegality, and the judgment of this Court in the Open Door Counselling case is not open to any other interpretation.""', 'Mr Justice McCarthy also considered that an injunction should be issued and commented as follows:', '""In the light of the availability of such information from a variety of sources, such as imported magazines, etc., I am far from satisfied that the granting of an injunction to restrain these defendants from publishing the material impugned would save the life of a single unborn child, but I am more than satisfied that if the courts fail to enforce, and enforce forthwith, that guarantee as construed in A.G. (S.P.U.C.) v. Open Door Counselling Ltd ([1988] Irish Reports 593), then the rule of law will be set at nought.""', '24. In a judgment of 4 October 1991 on the questions referred under Article 177 of the EEC Treaty, following the Supreme Court ’ s judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled that the medical termination of pregnancy, performed in accordance with the law of the State in which it is carried out, constitutes a service within the meaning of Article 60 of the Treaty. However it found that the link between the activity of the student associations and medical terminations of pregnancy carried out in clinics in another member State was too tenuous for the prohibition on the distribution of information to be capable of being regarded as a restriction on the freedom to supply services within the meaning of Article 59 of the Treaty. The Court did not examine whether the prohibition was in breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. In the light of its conclusions concerning the restriction on services it considered that it had no jurisdiction with regard to national legislation ""lying outside the scope of Community law"". Accordingly, the restrictions on the publication of information by student associations were not considered to be contrary to Community law (see paragraphs 22-23 above, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( Ireland ) Ltd v. Stephen Grogan and Others [1991] European Court Reports I, pp. 4733-4742).', '25. The interpretation to be given to Article 40.3.3 o of the Constitution also arose before the Supreme Court in the case of The Attorney General v. X and Others which concerned an application to the courts by the Attorney General for an injunction to prevent a 14-year-old girl who was pregnant from leaving the jurisdiction to have an abortion abroad. The girl alleged that she had been raped and had expressed the desire to commit suicide. The Supreme Court, in its judgment of 5 March 1992, found that termination of pregnancy was permissible under Article 40.3.3 o where it was established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother if such termination was not effected. Finding that this test was satisfied on the facts of the case the Supreme Court discharged the injunction which had been granted by the High Court at first instance.', 'A majority of three judges of the Supreme Court ( Finlay CJ, Hederman and Egan JJ.) expressed the view that Article 40.3.3 o empowered the courts in proper cases to restrain by injunction a pregnant woman from leaving the jurisdiction to have an abortion so that the right to life of the unborn might be defended and vindicated.', 'During the oral hearing before the European Court of Human Rights, the Government made the following statement in the light of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in this case:', '""... persons who are deemed to be entitled under Irish law to avail themselves of termination of pregnancy in these circumstances must be regarded as being entitled to have appropriate access to information in relation to the facilities for such operations, either in Ireland or abroad.""', 'D. Evidence presented by the applicants', '26. The applicants presented evidence to the Court that there had been no significant drop in the number of Irish women having abortions in Great Britain since the granting of the injunction, that number being well over 3,500 women per year. They also submitted an opinion from an expert in public health (Dr J.R. Ashton) which concludes that there are five possible adverse implications for the health of Irish women arising from the injunction in the present case:', '1. An increase in the birth of unwanted and rejected children;', '2. An increase in illegal and unsafe abortions;', '3. A lack of adequate preparation of Irish women obtaining abortions;', '4. Increases in delay in obtaining abortions with ensuing increased complication rates;', '5. Poor aftercare with a failure to deal adequately with medical complications and a failure to provide adequate contraceptive advice.', 'In their written comments to the Court, S.P.U.C. claimed that the number of abortions obtained by Irish women in England, which had been rising rapidly prior to the enactment of Article 40.3.3 o, had increased at a much reduced pace. They further submitted that the number of births to married women had increased at a ""very substantial rate"".', '27. The applicants claimed that the impugned information was available in British newspapers and magazines which were imported into Ireland as well as in the yellow pages of the London telephone directory which could be purchased from the Irish telephone service. It was also available in publications such as the British Medical Journal which was obtainable in Ireland.', 'While not challenging the accuracy of the above information the Government observed that no newspaper or magazine had been produced in evidence to the Court.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE CONCERNING PROTECTION OF THE UNBORN', 'A. Constitutional protection', '28. Article 40.3.3 o of the Irish Constitution (the Eighth Amendment), which came into force in 1983 following a referendum, reads:', '""The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.""', 'This provision has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the present case, in the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( Ireland ) Ltd v. Grogan and Others ([1989] Irish Reports, p. 753) and in The Attorney General v. X and Others (see paragraphs 22-25 above).', 'B. Statutory protection', '29. The statutory prohibition of abortion is contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Section 58 provides that:', '""Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, and whosoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or not be with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to betaken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, shall be guilty of a felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, [to imprisonment for life] ...""', 'Section 59 states that:', '""Whoever shall unlawfully supply or procure any poison or other noxious thing, or any instrument or thing whatsoever, knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof, ...""', '30. Section 16 of the Censorship of Publications Act 1929 as amended by section 12 of the Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 provides that:', '""It shall not be lawful for any person, otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing granted to him under this section', '(a) to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published, or', '(b) to sell or expose, offer or keep for sale or', '(c) to distribute, offer or keep for distribution,', 'any book or periodical publication (whether appearing on the register of prohibited publications or not) which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or any method, treatment or appliance to be used for the purpose of such procurement.""', '31. Section 58 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 provides that ""the law relating to wrongs shall apply to an unborn child for his protection in like manner as if the child were born, provided the child is subsequently born alive"".', '32. Section 10 of the Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 re-affirms the statutory prohibition of abortion and states as follows:', '""Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorising -', '(a) the procuring of abortion,', '(b) the doing of any other thing the doing of which is prohibited by section 58 or 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 (which sections prohibit the administering of drugs or the use of any instruments to procure abortion) or,', '(c) the sale, importation into the State, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients .""', 'C. Case-law', '33. Apart from the present case and subsequent developments (see paragraphs 11-25 above), reference has been made to the right to life of the unborn in various decisions of the Supreme Court (see, for example, McGee v. Attorney General [1974] Irish Reports, p. 264, G. v. An Bord Uchtala [1980] Irish Reports, p. 32, Norris v. Attorney General [1984] Irish Reports, p. 36).', '34. In the case of G. v. An Bord Uchtala (loc. cit.) Mr Justice Walsh stated as follows:', '""[A child] has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against all threats directed to its existence, whether before or after birth ... The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended that life ...""', '35. The Supreme Court has also stated that the courts are the custodians of the fundamental rights set out in the Constitution and that their powers in this regard are as ample as the defence of the Constitution requires (The State (Quinn) v. Ryan [1965] Irish Reports 70). Moreover, an infringement of a constitutional right by an individual may be actionable in damages as a constitutional tort ( Meskell v. C.I.E. [1973] Irish Reports, p. 121).', 'In his judgment in The People v. Shaw ([1982] Irish Reports, p. 1), Mr Justice Kenny observed:', '""When the People enacted the Constitution of 1937, they provided (Article 40,s.3) that the State guaranteed in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen and that the State should, in particular, by its laws protect as best it might from unjust attack and in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen. I draw attention to the use of the words ‘ the State ’. The obligation to implement this guarantee is imposed not on the Oireachtas only, but on each branch of the State which exercises the powers of legislating, executing and giving judgment on those laws: Article 6. The word ‘ laws ’ in Article 40,s.3 is not confined to laws which have been enacted by the Oireachtas, but comprehends the laws made by judges and by ministers of State when they make statutory instruments or regulations.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '36. In their applications (nos. 14234 and 14235/88) lodged with the Commission on 19 August and 22 September 1988 the applicants complained that the injunction in question constituted an unjustified interference with their right to impart or receive information contrary to Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. Open Door, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty further claimed that the restrictions amounted to an interference with their right to respect for private life in breach of Article 8 (art. 8) and, in the case of Open Door, discrimination contrary to Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 8 and 10 (art. 14+8, art. 14+10).', '37. The Commission joined the applications on 14 March 1989 and declared the case admissible on 15 May 1990. In its report of 7 March 1991 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion:', '(a) by eight votes to five, that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) in respect of the Supreme Court injunction as it affected the applicant companies and counsellors;', '(b) by seven votes to six, that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) in respect of the Supreme Court injunction as it affected Mrs X and Ms Geraghty;', '(c) by seven votes to two, with four abstentions, that it was not necessary to examine further the complaints of Mrs X and Ms Geraghty under Article 8 (art. 8);', '(d) unanimously, that there had been no violation of Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) in respect of Open Door.', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the seven separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT', '38. At the public hearing on 24 March 1992 the Government maintained in substance the arguments and submissions set out in their memorial whereby they invited the Court to find that there had been no breach of the Convention.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. SCOPE OF THE DUBLIN WELL WOMAN CASE', '39. In their original application to the Commission Dublin Well Woman and the two counsellors, Ms Maher and Ms Downes, alleged that the Supreme Court injunction constituted an unjustified interference with their right to impart information, in breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'In their pleadings before the Court they further complained that there had also been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8). They had not raised this complaint before the Commission.', '40. The scope of the Court ’ s jurisdiction is determined by the Commission ’ s decision declaring the originating application admissible (see, inter alia, the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 27, para. 46). The Court considers that the applicants are now seeking to raise before the Court a new and separate complaint. As such it has no jurisdiction to entertain it.', 'II. THE GOVERNMENT ’ S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS', 'A. Whether Ms Maher, Ms Downes, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty can claim to be ""victims"" of a violation of the Convention', '41. The Government submitted, as they had done before the Commission, that only the corporate applicants could claim to be ""victims"" of an infringement of their Convention rights. Ms Maher, Ms Downes, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty had not been involved in the proceedings before the Irish courts. Moreover the applicants had failed to identify a single pregnant woman who could claim to be a ""victim"" of the matters complained of. In this respect the case was in the nature of an actio popularis, particularly as regards Mrs X and Ms Geraghty.', '1. Ms MahDoneer and Ms Downes', '42. The Delegate of the Commission pointed out that the Government ’ s plea as regards the applicant counsellors (Ms Maher and Ms Downes ) conflicted with their concession in the pleadings before the Commission that these applicants were subject to the restraint of the Supreme Court injunction and could therefore properly claim to have suffered an interference with their Article 10 (art. 10) rights.', '43. The Court agrees with the Commission that Ms Maher and Ms Downes can properly claim to be ""victims"" of an interference with their rights since they were directly affected by the Supreme Court injunction. Moreover, it considers that the Government are precluded from making submissions as regards preliminary exceptions which are inconsistent with concessions previously made in their pleadings before the Commission (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland judgment of 29 November 1991, Series A no. 222, pp. 21-22, para. 47, and the Kolompar v. Belgium judgment of 24 September 1992, Series A no. 235-C, p. 54, para. 32).', '2. Mrs X and Ms Geraghty', '44. The Court recalls that Article 25 (art. 25) entitles individuals to contend that a law violates their rights by itself, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if they run the risk of being directly affected by it (see, inter alia, the Johnston and Others v. Ireland judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, p. 21, para. 42).', 'In the present case the Supreme Court injunction restrained the corporate applicants and their servants and agents from providing certain information to pregnant women. Although it has not been asserted that Mrs X and Ms Geraghty are pregnant, it is not disputed that they belong to a class of women of child-bearing age which may be adversely affected by the restrictions imposed by the injunction. They are not seeking to challenge in abstracto the compatibility of Irish law with the Convention since they run a risk of being directly prejudiced by the measure complained of. They can thus claim to be ""victims"" within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1).', 'B. Whether the application complies with the six-month rule', '45. At the oral hearing the Government submitted that the application should be rejected under Article 26 (art. 26) for failure to comply with the six-month rule, on the grounds that the applicants were relying on case-law and arguments which were not raised before the domestic courts.', '46. The Court observes that while this plea was made before the Commission (see Appendix II of the Commission ’ s report) it was not re-iterated in the Government ’ s memorial to the Court and was raised solely at the oral hearing. Rule 48 para. 1 of the Rules of Court, however, required them to file it before the expiry of the time-limit laid down for the filing of their memorial, with the result that it must therefore be rejected as being out of time (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, p. 28, para. 56).', 'C. Whether the applicants had exhausted domestic remedies', '47. In their memorial the Government submitted - as they had also done before the Commission - that domestic remedies had not been exhausted, as required by Article 26 (art. 26), by:', '1. Open Door as regards its complaints under Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14);', '2. both Open Door and Dublin Well Woman in so far as they sought to introduce in their complaint under Article 10 (art. 10) evidence and submissions concerning abortion and the impact of the Supreme Court injunction on women ’ s health that had not been raised before the Irish courts;', '3. Ms Maher, Ms Downes, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty on the grounds that they had made no attempt to exhaust domestic remedies under Irish law and that they had not been involved in any capacity in the relevant proceedings before the Irish courts.', '48. As regards (1) the Court observes that Open Door would have had no prospect of success in asserting these complaints having regard to the reasoning of the Supreme Court concerning the high level of protection afforded to the right to life of the unborn child under Irish law (see paragraphs 16-25 above).', '49. As regards (2) Open Door and Dublin Well Woman are not introducing a fresh complaint in respect of which they have not exhausted domestic remedies. They are merely developing their submissions in respect of complaints which have already been examined by the Irish courts. Article 26 (art. 26) imposes no impediments to applicants in this regard. It is clear from the judgment of the Supreme Court that the applicants had in fact argued that an injunction would adversely affect women ’ s health and that this submission was rejected (see paragraph 18 above).', '50. Finally, as regards (3) it emerges from the judgments of the Supreme Court in the present case and in subsequent cases (see paragraphs 16-25 above) that any action brought by the four individual applicants would have had no prospects of success.', '51. Accordingly, the Government ’ s objection based on non- exhaustion of domestic remedies fails.', 'Conclusion', '52. To sum up, the Court is able to take cognisance of the merits of the case as regards all of the applicants.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '53. The applicants alleged that the Supreme Court injunction, restraining them from assisting pregnant women to travel abroad to obtain abortions, infringed the rights of the corporate applicants and the two counsellors to impart information, as well as the rights of Mrs X and Ms Geraghty to receive information. They confined their complaint to that part of the injunction which concerned the provision of information to pregnant women as opposed to the making of travel arrangements or referral to clinics (see paragraph 20 above). They invoked Article 10 (art. 10) which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '54. In their submissions to the Court the Government contested these claims and also contended that Article 10 (art. 10) should be interpreted against the background of Articles 2, 17 and 60 (art. 2, art. 17, art. 60) of the Convention the relevant parts of which state:', 'Article 2 (art. 2)', '""1. Everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.', '...""', 'Article 17 (art. 17)', '""Nothing in [the] Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.""', 'Article 60 (art. 60)', '""Nothing in [the] Convention shall be construed as limiting or derogating from any of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which may be ensured under the laws of any High Contracting Party or under any other agreement to which it is a Party.""', 'A. Was there an interference with the applicants ’ rights?', '55. The Court notes that the Government accepted that the injunction interfered with the freedom of the corporate applicants to impart information. Having regard to the scope of the injunction which also restrains the ""servants or agents"" of the corporate applicants from assisting ""pregnant women"" (see paragraph 20 above), there can be no doubt that there was also an interference with the rights of the applicant counsellors to impart information and with the rights of Mrs X and Ms Geraghty to receive information in the event of being pregnant.', 'To determine whether such an interference entails a violation of Article 10 (art. 10), the Court must examine whether or not it was justified under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) by reason of being a restriction ""prescribed by law"" which was necessary in a democratic society on one or other of the grounds specified in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'B. Was the restriction ""prescribed by law""?', '1. Arguments presented by those appearing before the Court', '56. Open Door and Dublin Well Woman submitted that the law was not formulated with sufficient precision to have enabled them to foresee that the non-directive counselling in which they were involved would be restrained by the courts. It was not clear from the wording of Article 40.3.3 o of the Constitution (the Eighth Amendment), which gave rise to many difficulties of interpretation and application, that those giving information to pregnant women would be in breach of this provision. In the same way, it was not clear whether it could have been used as a means of prohibiting access to foreign periodicals containing advertisements for abortion facilities abroad or of restricting other activities involving a ""threat"" to the life of the unborn such as travelling abroad to have an abortion.', 'In this respect the applicants pointed out that the provision had been criticised at the time of its enactment by both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions on the grounds that it was ambiguous and uncertain. Furthermore, although there was an expectation that there would be legislation to clarify the meaning of the provision, none was in fact enacted.', 'They also maintained that on its face Article 40.3.3 o is addressed only to the State and not to private persons. Thus they had no way of knowing that it would apply to non-directive counselling by private agencies. Indeed, since none of Ireland ’ s other laws concerning abortion forbids such counselling or travelling abroad to have an abortion they had good reason to believe that this activity was lawful.', 'Finally, the insufficient precision of the Eighth Amendment was well reflected in the recent judgment of the Supreme Court of 5 March 1992 in The Attorney General v. X and Others which, as conceded by the Government, had the consequence that it would now be lawful to provide information concerning abortion services abroad in certain circumstances (see paragraph 25 above).', 'In sum, given the uncertain scope of this provision and the considerable doubt as to its meaning and effect, even amongst the most authoritative opinion, the applicants could not have foreseen that such non-directive counselling was unlawful.', '57. The Government submitted that the legal position was reasonably foreseeable with appropriate legal advice, within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law. The applicants ought to have known that an injunction could be obtained against them to protect or defend rights guaranteed by the Constitution, or recognised at common law, or under the principles of the law of equity. Indeed, evidence had now come to light subsequent to the publication of the Commission ’ s report that Dublin Well Woman had actually received legal advice concerning the implications of the wording of the Amendment which warned that a court injunction to restrain their counselling activities was possible (see paragraph 10 in fine above). It was thus not open to the applicants, against this background, to argue that the injunction was unforeseeable.', '58. For the Commission, the Eighth Amendment did not provide a clear basis for the applicants to have foreseen that providing information about lawful services abroad would be unlawful. A law restricting freedom of expression across frontiers in such a vital area required particular precision to enable individuals to regulate their conduct accordingly. Since it was not against the criminal law for women to travel abroad to have an abortion, lawyers could reasonably have concluded that the provision of information did not involve a criminal offence. In addition, the Government had been unable to show, with reference to case-law, that the applicant companies could have foreseen that their counselling service was a constitutional tort (see paragraph 35 above). Moreover, the wording of the Amendment suggested that legislation was to have been enacted regulating the protection of the rights of the unborn.', '2. Court ’ s examination of the issue', '59. This question must be approached by considering not merely the wording of Article 40.3.3 o in isolation but also the protection given under Irish law to the rights of the unborn in statute law and in case-law (see paragraphs 28-35 above).', 'It is true that it is not a criminal offence to have an abortion outside Ireland and that the practice of non-directive counselling of pregnant women did not infringe the criminal law as such. Moreover, on its face the language of Article 40.3.3 o appears to enjoin only the State to protect the right to life of the unborn and suggests that regulatory legislation will be introduced at some future stage.', 'On the other hand, it is clear from Irish case-law, even prior to 1983, that infringement of constitutional rights by private individuals as well as by the State may be actionable (see paragraph 35 above). Furthermore, the constitutional obligation that the State defend and vindicate personal rights ""by its laws"" has been interpreted by the courts as not being confined merely to ""laws"" which have been enacted by the Irish Parliament ( Oireachtas ) but as also comprehending judge-made ""law"". In this regard the Irish courts, as the custodians of fundamental rights, have emphasised that they are endowed with the necessary powers to ensure their protection (ibid.).', '60. Taking into consideration the high threshold of protection of the unborn provided under Irish law generally and the manner in which the courts have interpreted their role as the guarantors of constitutional rights, the possibility that action might be taken against the corporate applicants must have been, with appropriate legal advice, reasonably foreseeable (See the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, para. 49). This conclusion is reinforced by the legal advice that was actually given to Dublin Well Woman that, in the light of Article 40.3.3 o, an injunction could be sought against its counselling activities (see paragraph 10 in fine above).', 'The restriction was accordingly ""prescribed by law"".', 'C. Did the restriction have aims that were legitimate under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2)?', '61. The Government submitted that the relevant provisions of Irish law are intended for the protection of the rights of others - in this instance the unborn -, for the protection of morals and, where appropriate, for the prevention of crime.', '62. The applicants disagreed, contending inter alia that, in view of the use of the term ""everyone"" in Article 10 para. 1 (art. 10-1) and throughout the Convention, it would be illogical to interpret the ""rights of others"" in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) as encompassing the unborn.', '63. The Court cannot accept that the restrictions at issue pursued the aim of the prevention of crime since, as noted above (paragraph 59), neither the provision of the information in question nor the obtaining of an abortion outside the jurisdiction involved any criminal offence. However, it is evident that the protection afforded under Irish law to the right to life of the unborn is based on profound moral values concerning the nature of life which were reflected in the stance of the majority of the Irish people against abortion as expressed in the 1983 referendum (see paragraph 28 above). The restriction thus pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of morals of which the protection in Ireland of the right to life of the unborn is one aspect. It is not necessary in the light of this conclusion to decide whether the term ""others"" under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) extends to the unborn.', 'D. Was the restriction necessary in a democratic society?', '64. The Government submitted that the Court ’ s approach to the assessment of the ""necessity"" of the restraint should be guided by the fact that the protection of the rights of the unborn in Ireland could be derived from Articles 2, 17 and 60 (art. 2, art. 17, art. 60) of the Convention. They further contended that the ""proportionality"" test was inadequate where the rights of the unborn were at issue. The Court will examine these issues in turn.', '1. Article 2 (art. 2)', '65. The Government maintained that the injunction was necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the right to life of the unborn and that Article 10 (art. 10) should be interpreted inter alia against the background of Article 2 (art. 2) of the Convention which, they argued, also protected unborn life. The view that abortion was morally wrong was the deeply held view of the majority of the people in Ireland and it was not the proper function of the Court to seek to impose a different viewpoint.', '66. The Court observes at the outset that in the present case it is not called upon to examine whether a right to abortion is guaranteed under the Convention or whether the foetus is encompassed by the right to life as contained in Article 2 (art. 2). The applicants have not claimed that the Convention contains a right to abortion, as such, their complaint being limited to that part of the injunction which restricts their freedom to impart and receive information concerning abortion abroad (see paragraph 20 above).', 'Thus the only issue to be addressed is whether the restrictions on the freedom to impart and receive information contained in the relevant part of the injunction are necessary in a democratic society for the legitimate aim of the protection of morals as explained above (see paragraph 63). It follows from this approach that the Government ’ s argument based on Article 2 (art. 2) of the Convention does not fall to be examined in the present case. On the other hand, the arguments based on Articles 17 and 60 (art. 17, art. 60) fall to be considered below (see paragraphs 78 and 79).', '2. Proportionality', '67. The Government stressed the limited nature of the Supreme Court ’ s injunction which only restrained the provision of certain information (see paragraph 20 above). There was no limitation on discussion in Ireland about abortion generally or the right of women to travel abroad to obtain one. They further contended that the Convention test as regards the proportionality of the restriction was inadequate where a question concerning the extinction of life was at stake. The right to life could not, like other rights, be measured according to a graduated scale. It was either respected or it was not. Accordingly, the traditional approach of weighing competing rights and interests in the balance was inappropriate where the destruction of unborn life was concerned. Since life was a primary value which was antecedent to and a prerequisite for the enjoyment of every other right, its protection might involve the infringement of other rights such as freedom of expression in a manner which might not be acceptable in the defence of rights of a lesser nature.', 'The Government also emphasised that, in granting the injunction, the Supreme Court was merely sustaining the logic of Article 40.3.3 o of the Constitution. The determination by the Irish courts that the provision of information by the relevant applicants assisted in the destruction of unborn life was not open to review by the Convention institutions.', '68. The Court cannot agree that the State ’ s discretion in the field of the protection of morals is unfettered and unreviewable (see, mutatis mutandis, for a similar argument, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, p. 20, para. 45).', 'It acknowledges that the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters of morals, particularly in an area such as the present which touches on matters of belief concerning the nature of human life. As the Court has observed before, it is not possible to find in the legal and social orders of the Contracting States a uniform European conception of morals, and the State authorities are, in principle, in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of the requirements of morals as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" or ""penalty"" intended to meet them (see, inter alia, the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 22, para. 48, and the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35).', 'However this power of appreciation is not unlimited. It is for the Court, in this field also, to supervise whether a restriction is compatible with the Convention.', '69. As regards the application of the ""proportionality"" test, the logical consequence of the Government ’ s argument is that measures taken by the national authorities to protect the right to life of the unborn or to uphold the constitutional guarantee on the subject would be automatically justified under the Convention where infringement of a right of a lesser stature was alleged. It is, in principle, open to the national authorities to take such action as they consider necessary to respect the rule of law or to give effect to constitutional rights. However, they must do so in a manner which is compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions. To accept the Government ’ s pleading on this point would amount to an abdication of the Court ’ s responsibility under Article 19 (art. 19) ""to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties ..."".', '70. Accordingly, the Court must examine the question of ""necessity"" in the light of the principles developed in its case-law (see, inter alia, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59). It must determine whether there existed a pressing social need for the measures in question and, in particular, whether the restriction complained of was ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"" (ibid.).', '71. In this context, it is appropriate to recall that freedom of expression is also applicable to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"" (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Handyside judgment, Series A no. 24, p. 23, para. 49).', '72. While the relevant restriction, as observed by the Government, is limited to the provision of information, it is recalled that it is not a criminal offence under Irish law for a pregnant woman to travel abroad in order to have an abortion. Furthermore, the injunction limited the freedom to receive and impart information with respect to services which are lawful in other Convention countries and may be crucial to a woman ’ s health and well-being. Limitations on information concerning activities which, notwithstanding their moral implications, have been and continue to be tolerated by national authorities, call for careful scrutiny by the Convention institutions as to their conformity with the tenets of a democratic society.', '73. The Court is first struck by the absolute nature of the Supreme Court injunction which imposed a ""perpetual"" restraint on the provision of information to pregnant women concerning abortion facilities abroad, regardless of age or state of health or their reasons for seeking counselling on the termination of pregnancy. The sweeping nature of this restriction has since been highlighted by the case of The Attorney General v. X and Others and by the concession made by the Government at the oral hearing that the injunction no longer applied to women who, in the circumstances as defined in the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in that case, were now free to have an abortion in Ireland or abroad (see paragraph 25 above).', '74. On that ground alone the restriction appears over broad and disproportionate. Moreover, this assessment is confirmed by other factors.', '75. In the first place, it is to be noted that the corporate applicants were engaged in the counselling of pregnant women in the course of which counsellors neither advocated nor encouraged abortion, but confined themselves to an explanation of the available options (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The decision as to whether or not to act on the information so provided was that of the woman concerned. There can be little doubt that following such counselling there were women who decided against a termination of pregnancy. Accordingly, the link between the provision of information and the destruction of unborn life is not as definite as contended. Such counselling had in fact been tolerated by the State authorities even after the passing of the Eighth Amendment in 1983 until the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the present case. Furthermore, the information that was provided by the relevant applicants concerning abortion facilities abroad was not made available to the public at large.', '76. It has not been seriously contested by the Government that information concerning abortion facilities abroad can be obtained from other sources in Ireland such as magazines and telephone directories (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above) or by persons with contacts in Great Britain. Accordingly, information that the injunction sought to restrict was already available elsewhere although in a manner which was not supervised by qualified personnel and thus less protective of women ’ s health. Furthermore, the injunction appears to have been largely ineffective in protecting the right to life of the unborn since it did not prevent large numbers of Irish women from continuing to obtain abortions in Great Britain (see paragraph 26 above).', '77. In addition, the available evidence, which has not been disputed by the Government, suggests that the injunction has created a risk to the health of those women who are now seeking abortions at a later stage in their pregnancy, due to lack of proper counselling, and who are not availing themselves of customary medical supervision after the abortion has taken place (see paragraph 26 above). Moreover, the injunction may have had more adverse effects on women who were not sufficiently resourceful or had not the necessary level of education to have access to alternative sources of information (see paragraph 76 above). These are certainly legitimate factors to take into consideration in assessing the proportionality of the restriction.', '3. Articles 17 and 60 (art. 17, art. 60)', '78. The Government, invoking Articles 17 and 60 (art. 17, art. 60) of the Convention, have submitted that Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a manner as to limit, destroy or derogate from the right to life of the unborn which enjoys special protection under Irish law.', '79. Without calling into question under the Convention the regime of protection of unborn life that exists under Irish law, the Court recalls that the injunction did not prevent Irish women from having abortions abroad and that the information it sought to restrain was available from other sources (see paragraph 76 above). Accordingly, it is not the interpretation of Article 10 (art. 10) but the position in Ireland as regards the implementation of the law that makes possible the continuance of the current level of abortions obtained by Irish women abroad.', '4. Conclusion', '80. In the light of the above, the Court concludes that the restraint imposed on the applicants from receiving or imparting information was disproportionate to the aims pursued. Accordingly there has been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 8 AND 14 (art. 8, art. 14)', '81. Open Door also alleged a violation of the right to respect for private life contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) claiming that it should be open to it to complain of an interference with the privacy rights of its clients. Similarly, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty complained under this provision that the denial to them of access to information concerning abortion abroad constituted an unjustifiable interference with their right to respect for private life.', 'Open Door further claimed discrimination contrary to Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 (art. 14+8) alleging that the injunction discriminated against women since men were not denied information ""critical to their reproductive and health choices"". It also invoked Article 14 in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) claiming discrimination on the grounds of political or other opinion since those who seek to counsel against abortion are permitted to express their views without restriction.', '82. The applicants in the Dublin Well Woman case, in their memorial to the Court, similarly complained of discrimination contrary to Article 14, firstly, in conjunction with Article 8 (art. 14+8) on the same basis as Open Door, and secondly, in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) on the grounds that it followed from the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Grogan case (see paragraph 24 above) that, had Dublin Well Woman been an ""economic operator"", they would have been permitted to distribute and receive such information.', '83. The Court notes that the complaints of discrimination made by the applicants in Dublin Well Woman were made for the first time in the proceedings before the Court and that consequently it may be questioned whether it has jurisdiction to examine them (see paragraph 40 above). However, having regard to its finding that there had been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) (see paragraph 80 above) the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine either these complaints or those made by Open Door, Mrs X and Ms Geraghty.', 'V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '84. Article 50 (art. 50) provides as follows:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Damage', '85. Open Door made no claim for compensation for damage. Dublin Well Woman, on the other hand, claimed pecuniary damages amounting to IR£62,172 in respect of loss of income for the period January 1987 to June 1988 due to the discontinuance of the pregnancy counselling service.', '86. The Government submitted that the claim should be rejected. In particular, they contended that it was made belatedly; that it was inconsistent with Dublin Well Woman ’ s status as a non-profit- making company to claim pecuniary damage and was excessive.', '87. The Court notes that the claim was made on 24 February 1992 and thus well in advance of the hearing of the case on 24 March 1992. Furthermore, it considers that even a non-profit- making company such as the applicant can incur losses for which it should be compensated.', 'The Government have submitted that it was unclear on what basis or in what manner the sum of IR£62,172 was computed and Dublin Well Woman has not indicated how these losses were calculated or sought to substantiate them. Nevertheless, the discontinuance of the counselling service must have resulted in a loss of income. Having regard to equitable considerations as required by Article 50 (art. 50), the Court awards IR£25,000 under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '1. Open Door', '88. Open Door claimed the sum of IR£68,985.75 referable to both the national proceedings and to those before the Convention institutions. This sum did not take into account what had been received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe in respect of fees. On 1 May 1992 Mr Cole, a lawyer who had appeared on behalf of Open Door, filed a supplementary claim for US$24,300 on behalf of the Centre for Constitutional Rights.', '89. The Government considered the claim made by Open Door to be reasonable.', '90. The Court observes that the claim made by Open Door includes an amount for the services of Mr Cole of the Centre for Constitutional Rights. It rejects his supplementary claim on behalf of the Centre for Constitutional Rights which was not itself a party to the proceedings. However, it allows Open Door ’ s uncontested claim less 6,900 French francs paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees.', '2. Dublin Well Woman', '91. Dublin Well Woman claimed a total sum of IR£63,302.84 for costs and expenses incurred in the national proceedings. They further claimed IR£21,084.95 and IR£27,116.30 in respect of proceedings before the Commission and the Court. These sums did not take into account what had been received by way of legal aid in respect of fees and expenses.', '92. The Government accepted that the claims for domestic costs were reasonable. However they submitted that, in the light of the claim made by Open Door, IR£16,000 and IR£19,000 were more appropriate sums for the proceedings before the Commission and Court.', '93. The Court also considers that the amount claimed in respect of the proceedings before the Commission and Court is excessive taking into account the fees claimed by Open Door and the differences between the two applications. It holds that Dublin Well Woman should be awarded IR£100,000 under this head less 52,577 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees and expenses.', '94. The amounts awarded in this judgment are to be increased by any value-added tax that may be chargeable.']",2,ie,001-57789,1

Following a hearing held on 28 February and 1 March 1985, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court appointed two experts - professors at the Athens Polytechnic School - who, with two other experts, designated by the applicant, compared the two studies.', 'In their report of 26 September 1985 the two professors concluded as follows:', '""... in our opinion, the two studies, for the K.E.T.A. and ELFON, follow different methods, the two missiles are different and the second is not a copy of the first .... Nevertheless, some transfer of technical knowledge inevitably occurred .... It is not possible to determine the extent of such transfer beyond what is mentioned above under (b), (c) and (d), because the ELFON study and even more so the K.E.T.A. report were shoddily drafted and were full of imprecisions and omissions; it should be stressed that in both studies the aerodynamic data are erroneous ...""', 'They noted that Mr Hadjianastassiou had some technical knowledge, acquired during his studies in the United States. However, his participation in the K.E.T.A. project had enriched his experience. The components of the missile and some of the theoretical data contained in the two studies could be found in various manuals included in the file and regarded as ""available literature"". These manuals were not classified as ""secret"", but it was not established that they were accessible to private individuals.', '10. At a new hearing held on 21 and 22 November 1985 the Courts-Martial Appeal Court took evidence from nineteen witnesses on whether the two studies contained common data, whether the information which had formed the basis of the studies was freely available in scientific literature and whether the K.E.T.A. study had been classified as a ""military secret"".', '11. After the hearing the Courts-Martial Appeal Court deliberated in private and considered the following questions formulated by its President:', '""1. Is Constantinos Hadjianastassiou guilty of having, between October 1982 and March 1983, unlawfully and intentionally communicated and disclosed to third parties military plans and information classified as secret and which had to remain secret in the military interests of the Greek State? [In particular, is he guilty of having] ..., in October 1982, after having contacted the company ELFON Ltd ... with a view to preparing and drawing up for the latter ’ s benefit a study on guided missiles, for a financial consideration to be agreed with the said company when the work was in progress, unlawfully and intentionally, (a) communicated to the above-mentioned company general information concerning the guided missile which was being designed at the K.E.T.A. and its technical characteristics, although as project officer for the K.E.T.A. missile he knew that such information was secret and that the military interests of the Greek State required that it be kept secret; (b) transmitted to the same company several elements deriving from the study, relating to the project and on the same subject-matter, of the K.E.T.A. and from the whole production programme of the Greek guided missile (""laser kit"") which existed at the centre and which concerned principally the dimensional diagram of the missile, its external geometry, its perimetric plan, its aerodynamic elements, its Nd -YAG laser type, its dynamic model, its dome, its schematic diagram, its seeker ’ s fairing, its basic electronics data, as well as any other theoretical or technical elements contained in the ELFON Ltd study ..., which was elaborated entirely on the basis of the information transmitted and disclosed by him to the company and derived from the corresponding K.E.T.A. project and study, although he knew, in his capacity as project officer ..., that the information was secret and that the military interests of the Greek State required that it be kept secret?', '2. Has it been established ... that, when he disclosed these military secrets, the accused believed, erroneously, that he was entitled to proceed in such a way or [, on the other hand,] that he reasonably believed that, having drawn up the K.E.T.A. study and used his own knowledge, he was entitled to elaborate a new study and submit it through the intermediary of the company ELFON Ltd to the Weapons Industry Department? Was this belief justifiable?', '3. Has it been established ... that the military secrets thus disclosed, namely the general information which [the accused] communicated to the ELFON company concerning the guided missile ... and its technical characteristics, were of minor importance?', '4. Should certain factors be taken into account in mitigation, namely that, prior to committing the above- mentioned act, the accused had led an honest and well-ordered private, family and professional life?', '...""', '12. According to the record of the deliberations, the Courts- Martial Appeal Court replied in the affirmative to questions 1 (a) (four votes to one), 3 and 4 (unanimously) and in the negative to questions 1 (b) (four votes to one) and 2 (three votes to two).', '13. Giving judgment in Mr Hadjianastassiou ’ s presence on 22 November 1985, it sentenced him for disclosure of military secrets of minor importance (Article 97 para. 2 of the Military Criminal Code, see paragraph 21 below) to a suspended term of five months ’ imprisonment, from which it deducted the four months and fourteen days which he had spent in detention on remand.', '14. The President of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court read out the judgment, which did not refer to the questions put to the members of the court.', '15. In order to obtain the text of these questions and the replies given, the applicant asked, on 23 November 1985, to see the record of the hearing. The registrar allegedly told him that he would have to wait for the ""finalised version"" of the judgment.', 'C. The proceedings before the Court of Cassation', '16. On 26 November 1985 - within the five days prescribed in Article 425 para. 1 of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 below) - Mr Hadjianastassiou appealed to the Court of Cassation; in his appeal, which was a page long, he alleged ""the erroneous application and interpretation of the provisions under which he [had been] convicted, namely Article 97 para. 2 of the Military Criminal Code"".', '17. He received a copy of the appeal judgment on 16 December; it was very short and did not state the grounds on which it was based, merely referring to the fixing of sentence.', '18. On 23 December 1985 the applicant again demanded that the record be communicated to him; he received it on 10 January 1986. This document, which was detailed and reproduced in full the six questions and the replies obtained, ended as follows:', '""...', 'The Court, by four votes to one ..., finds the accused Hadjianastassiou guilty of disclosing military secrets, which offence was committed in Attica between October 1982 and March 1983.', 'By three votes to two ..., the Court dismisses the defence request that Article 31 para. 2 of the Criminal Code (not guilty in the event of mistake) be applied.', 'The Court unanimously accepts that the military secrets communicated are of minor importance.', 'The Court unanimously accepts the factors pleaded in mitigation (Article 84 para. 2 (a) of the Criminal Code).', 'Having regard to the following Articles: ...

The hearing in the Court of Cassation ( Areios Pagos ) took place on 11 April 1986.', 'On 14 April Mr Hadjianastassiou filed a memorial in support of his oral pleadings. In his submission the wording of his appeal was sufficient to rule out any danger of its being dismissed for lack of precision. He complained of the shortness of the time-limit for appealing against the decisions of the military courts and the fact that it was impossible for the persons concerned to gain access, in good time, to the contents of the contested judgments. He also challenged the ground on which his conviction rested: the communication of ""general information"" on the K.E.T.A. missile, the charge which the Courts-Martial Appeal Court found to be proved, did not justify the application of Article 98 of the Military Criminal Code as that provision concerned the disclosure of secret information of military importance, a charge of which the Courts-Martial Appeal Court had acquitted him by its reply to question 1 (b) (see paragraph 11 above). In his view, at the most his case might fall under Article 96 (see paragraph 21 below).', '20. On 18 June 1986 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on the following grounds:', '""By the appeal before the Court ..., in which it is sought to have judgment no. 616/1985 of the Athens Courts-Martial Appeal Court set aside, the [applicant] challenges the aforesaid judgment on the ground of erroneous application and interpretation of the provisions under which he was convicted, namely Article 97 para. 2 of the Military Criminal Code. However, this sole ground of appeal, as formulated above, is vague inasmuch as it does not identify any concrete and specific error in the contested judgment which could constitute the basis of the complaint alleging the erroneous application and interpretation of the above-mentioned provision; the appeal must therefore be declared inadmissible by virtue of Articles 476 para. 1 and 513 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.""']","['II.

According to the consistent case-law of the Court of Cassation, the failure to give reasons in the decisions of the military courts does not render them void. The application to these courts of Article 93 para. 3 of the Constitution requires, under the terms of Article 96 para. 5, the adoption of special laws, and this has not yet happened (judgments nos. 470/1975, 483/1979, 18/1980, 647/1983, 531-535/1984 ( Nomiko Vima 1984, p. 1070) and 1494/1986). It is sufficient that such a decision answers the questions put by the President; the questions must indicate accurately all the offences of which the defendant is accused so as to make it possible for a subsequent review by the Court of Cassation to ensure that the provisions of the criminal law have been properly applied to the facts in question as found by the military courts of first or second instance (judgments nos. 456/1986 and 1494/1986).', 'C.

The relevant case-law of the Court of Cassation', '26. According to the case-law of the Court of Cassation (judgments nos. 656/1985 ( Nomiko Vima 1985, p. 891), 1768/1986, 205/1988 ( Nomiko Vima 1988, p. 588) and 565/1988), Article 473 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not apply to appeals on points of law from the decisions of the military courts, as the time-limit for such appeals is fixed by Article 425 of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 above).', 'The grounds of appeal to the Court of Cassation must be set out in the initial appeal memorial.

Mr Hadjianastassiou applied to the Commission on 17 December 1986. He relied on Article 6 (art. 6), complaining that the lack of reasons in the judgment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and the shortness of the time-limit for appealing had prevented him from further substantiating his appeal to the Court of Cassation. He maintained in addition that his conviction for the disclosure of military secrets of secondary importance had infringed his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10).', '28. The Commission declared the application (no. 12945/87) admissible on 4 October 1990. In its report of 6 June 1991 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (b) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-b), but not of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)', '29. Mr Hadjianastassiou relied on paragraphs 1 and 3 (b) of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-b), which are worded as follows:', '""1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...', '...', '3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:', '...', '(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;', '...""', 'He complained of the failure to give reasons in the judgment read out on 22 November 1985 by the President of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and the shortness of the time-limit for appealing to the Court of Cassation. Despite being present at the hearing, he had not discovered the precise reasons for his conviction until 10 January 1986, which had meant that his appeal on points of law had been bound to fail.', '30. The Government contested this view, to which the Commission subscribed in substance. In the former ’ s opinion, the applicant had been aware of the content of the questions put by the President of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court. Questions nos. 2 and 4 had been based on arguments put forward by Mr Hadjianastassiou himself in the Permanent Air Force Court. The reply to question no. 3, which had been formulated for the first time on appeal, was given expressly in the judgment read out by the President. As regards the question concerning the communication of information of ""military importance"", the President had divided it into two parts - 1 (a) and 1 (b) (see paragraph 11 above) - in order to take into account the conclusions of the experts and to show leniency to the accused, whose sentence had moreover been reduced. In addition, the questions, far from marking the conclusion of the court ’ s deliberations, had given rise to keen argument during the trial. In short, it had been entirely possible for Mr Hadjianastassiou to submit detailed and admissible grounds for appeal within the statutory time-limit.', '31. As the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-3) constitute specific aspects of the right to a fair trial, guaranteed under paragraph 1 (art. 6-1), the Court will examine the complaint under both provisions taken together.', '32. The Court notes at the outset that although Article 93 para. 3 of the Greek Constitution (see paragraph 22 above) requires all court judgments to be specifically and thoroughly reasoned, under Article 96 para. 5 the application of this requirement to the military courts is subject to the adoption of a special law. Such a law has still to be enacted. In the meantime the Court of Cassation can review the proper application of the criminal law by those courts only through the questions put by the presidents and the replies given by their colleagues, from which the reasoning is elicited.', '33. The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the appropriate means to ensure that their judicial systems comply with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6). The national courts must, however, indicate with sufficient clarity the grounds on which they based their decision. It is this, inter alia, which makes it possible for the accused to exercise usefully the rights of appeal available to him. The Court ’ s task is to consider whether the method adopted in this respect has led in a given case to results which are compatible with the Convention.', '34. In this instance the judgment read out by the President of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court contained no mention of the questions as they appeared in the record of the hearing (see paragraphs 11 and 18 above). Admittedly it referred to Article 366 et seq. of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 above) and described the information communicated as of minor importance, but it was not based on the same grounds as the decision of the Permanent Air Force Court. Question 1 (a), dealing with the communication of ""general information concerning the guided missile"" which had to be kept secret, appeared for the first time in the proceedings before the appeal court. When, the day after the delivery of the judgment, the applicant sought to obtain the full text of the questions, the registrar allegedly informed him that he would have to wait for the ""finalised version"" of the judgment (see paragraph 15 above). In his appeal on points of law, filed within the five-day time-limit laid down in Article 425 para. 1 of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 above), Mr Hadjianastassiou could rely only on what he had been able to hear or gather during the hearing and could do no more than refer generally to Article 426.', '35. In the Government ’ s contention, the applicant could have made further submissions by means of an additional memorial, pursuant to Article 509 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 25 above); if he had not availed himself of this possibility, it had been because he had had no ground for appeal to put forward.', '36. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. When Mr Hadjianastassiou received the record of the hearing, on 10 January 1986, he was barred from expanding upon his appeal on points of law. According to a consistent line of cases, additional submissions may be taken into account only if the initial appeal sets out at least one ground which is found to be admissible and sufficiently substantiated (see paragraph 26 above).', '37. In conclusion, the rights of the defence were subject to such restrictions that the applicant did not have the benefit of a fair trial. There has therefore been a violation of paragraph 3 (b) of Article 6, taken in conjunction with paragraph 1 (art. 6-3-b, art. 6-1).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '38. In Mr Hadjianastassiou ’ s submission, his conviction by the military courts also infringed Article 10 (art. 10), which provides as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '39. It should be recalled that the applicant, a serving officer, was convicted and sentenced for having disclosed military information of minor importance. The study in question was intended for communication to a private arms manufacturing company for a fee.', 'Of course, the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 (art. 10) applies to servicemen just as it does to other persons within the jurisdiction of the Contracting States (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 41, para. 100). Moreover information of the type in question does not fall outside the scope of Article 10 (art. 10), which is not restricted to certain categories of information, ideas or forms of expression (see the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, p. 17, para. 26).', '40. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the Permanent Air Force Court, then reduced by the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above), constituted an interference with the exercise of the applicant ’ s right to the freedom of expression. Such interference infringes Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in order to attain the aforesaid aims.', 'A. Was the interference ""prescribed by law""?', '41. According to Mr Hadjianastassiou, the first of these conditions was not satisfied because the ""law"" was not sufficiently foreseeable. The application by the Courts-Martial Appeal Court of Articles 97 and 98 of the Military Criminal Code had been erroneous (see paragraph 21 above); although these provisions had served as the basis for that court ’ s decision, it had not mentioned any specific secret data that had been transferred to ELFON.', '42. The Court notes, however, that the wording of the provisions in question (see paragraph 21 above) was not incompatible with the manner in which the Courts-Martial Appeal Court interpreted and applied them. Pointing out that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, the Kruslin v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, p. 21, para. 29), the Court finds, like the Government and the Commission, that the interference was ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Did the interference pursue a legitimate aim?', '43. Clearly the contested sentence was intended to punish the disclosure of information on an arms project classified as secret, and therefore to protect ""national security"", a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'C. Was the interference ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '44. Mr Hadjianastassiou denied that the interference was necessary. He argued that a routine technical study based entirely on his own documentation could not be regarded as damaging to national security. By its reply to question 1 (b) (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above), the Courts-Martial Appeal Court had acknowledged the lack of any relationship between the study effected for the air force and that for ELFON. In his view, there should have been regulations prohibiting serving Greek officers from working for private undertakings or allowing them to do so provided that they did not divulge military secrets; the Courts-Martial Appeal Court had not identified a single such secret divulged by him.', '45. In this instance the project for the manufacture of a guided missile undertaken by the air force was classified as a ""military secret"". The applicant ’ s conviction in the appeal court was, however, based on the disclosure of ""general information"" which military interests required to be kept secret; the experts appointed by the appeal court had concluded prior to its decision that, although the two studies had employed different methods, none the less ""some transfer of technical knowledge [had] inevitably occurred"" (see paragraph 9 above).', 'Like the Government, the Court takes the view that the disclosure of the State ’ s interest in a given weapon and that of the corresponding technical knowledge, which may give some indication of the state of progress in its manufacture, are capable of causing considerable damage to national security.', '46. It is also necessary to take into account the special conditions attaching to military life and the specific ""duties"" and ""responsibilities"" incumbent on the members of the armed forces (see the Engel and Others judgment, cited above, p. 41, para. 100). The applicant, as the officer at the K.E.T.A. in charge of an experimental missile programme, was bound by an obligation of discretion in relation to anything concerning the performance of his duties.', '47. In the light of these considerations, the Greek military courts cannot be said to have overstepped the limits of the margin of appreciation which is to be left to the domestic authorities in matters of national security. Nor does the evidence disclose the lack of a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim pursued.', 'In conclusion, no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) has been established.', 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '48. According to Article 50 (art. 50),', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'Under this provision Mr Hadjianastassiou claimed the reimbursement of his costs and expenses incurred first in the Greek courts (650,000 drachmas), and then before the Convention organs (300,000 drachmas and 29,260 French francs).', 'The Government considered these claims to be excessive, because they far exceeded the fee scales applicable to the legal profession as laid down by Greek law. They stated that they were willing to pay 100,000 drachmas in the event of a finding of a violation.', '49. The Court observes that it is not bound in this context by domestic scales or criteria (see, inter alia, the Granger v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 174, p. 20, para. 55).', 'Like the Commission, it takes the view that, for the costs incurred in Greece, only those referable to the Court of Cassation proceedings - 220,000 drachmas - can be reimbursed. The sums claimed in respect of the Strasbourg proceedings are consistent with the criteria laid down in the case-law and should therefore be awarded in their entirety.']",2,gr,001-57779,0

At the material time he was chairman and managing director of SAPVIN, a wholesale wine firm, whose head office is in Marseilles.', 'A. The house searches and seizures of documents', '7. In October 1976, in the course of an investigation into the SODEVIM company, customs officers seized documents relating to business transactions between SAPVIN and foreign firms.', '8. Thereafter, from 27 January 1977 to 26 February 1980, the customs authorities carried out eighty-three investigative operations in the form of interviews and of raids on SAPVIN’s head office, on the applicant’s home and at other addresses of his and on the homes of other people, during which further items were seized.', 'Each of the house searches was made under Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code (see paragraphs 19-20 below). They were conducted by officials from the National Customs Investigations Department (""the DNED"") in the presence of a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire); a report was made on each of them and they all led to Mr Crémieux’s being subsequently interviewed.', '9. Several such searches were made on 23 January 1979.', 'One of them began at 7 a.m. at the applicant’s Paris home, in his absence. The customs officers were received by Mr Crémieux’s son; they inspected the office and took away 518 documents, some of which, according to Mr Crémieux, had no connection with the customs investigation. The son initialled the inventory of documents. The applicant, who had arrived at 9.10 a.m., signed the report together with his son; he denied having been able, as the Government maintained, to go through the documents.', 'Another search began at 8 a.m. at the home of Mr Crémieux’s female companion, whom, the applicant claimed, the DNED officials had followed into the bathroom when she said she wanted to put on a dressing-gown. Numerous personal papers were seized.', 'Searches were also made of the homes of other people, who had business relations with the applicant and his company.', '10. On 24 January and 17 May 1979 Mr Crémieux was questioned by customs officers.', 'On 16 February 1979 they opened the private strongbox he had at SAPVIN’s head office and took seventeen documents from it.', 'B. The court proceedings', '1. The criminal proceedings against the applicant', '11. On a complaint by the Mediterranean Interregional Head Office of Customs, the Marseilles public prosecutor’s office began a judicial investigation in respect of Mr Crémieux and seven other people and passed the case to a local investigating judge on 16 June 1981.', '12. On 29 November 1982 this judge charged the eight with offences against the legislation and regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries.', 'The customs agreed to compound with those charged (see paragraph 23 below) - Mr Crémieux was to pay 1,400,000 French francs (FRF) and SAPVIN FRF 20,000,000 - and the judge accordingly issued a discharge order on 16 June 1987.', '2. The applicant’s proceedings to have the reports and seizures declared null and void', '(a) Before the Marseilles investigating judge', '13. On 8 August 1983 and 4 and 11 April 1984 Mr Crémieux applied to the Marseilles investigating judge for a declaration that the customs officers’ reports on the facts and on the seizures were null and void.', 'On 24 April 1984 the judge made an order that the file on the investigation in respect of Mr Crémieux and those charged with him should be sent to the Marseilles public prosecutor for an opinion.', 'The customs authorities and the public prosecutor’s office submitted that the relevant reports were valid and the house searches lawful.', '(b) In the Indictment Division of the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal', '14. On 22 June 1984 the investigating judge made an order whereby the case was referred directly to the Indictment Division of the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal for a decision on the lawfulness of the proceedings (Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).', '15. On 30 July 1984 the Indictment Division held that all the impugned reports were valid.', 'In the terms set out below, it dismissed an application by Mr Crémieux for a declaration that Articles 454 and 64 of the Customs Code had ceased to have effect in the light of the principles laid down in the Constitutional Council’s decision of 29 December 1983 (Official Gazette (Journal officiel ), 30 December 1983, p. 3871):', '""Paul Crémieux relied on the fact that in this decision the Constitutional Council held that ‘in order expressly to satisfy the requirements not only of the liberty of the individual and the inviolability of the home but also of the fight against customs evasion, the provisions of Article 89 of the Budget Act 1984 should have been accompanied by provisions and clarifications precluding any improper interpretation or practice and, accordingly, could not, as they stood, be held to be constitutional’.', 'The Indictment Division, however, cannot rule on the constitutionality of Articles 454 and 64 of the Customs Code in whatever form or context such unconstitutionality is pleaded.', 'This is because Article 27 of the Criminal Code provides that ‘any judge ... who stays or suspends the application of a statute ...’ shall be guilty of criminal malfeasance in public office.""', 'The Indictment Division did not rule on the issue - raised by the applicant before the investigating judge - whether the disputed customs measures were compatible with Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention.', '(c) In the Court of Cassation', '16. Mr Crémieux appealed on points of law. In the first of his three grounds he relied on, inter alia, the Convention:', '""Violation on account of the refusal to apply Articles 62 and 66 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958 and Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention ..., violation through improper application of Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code and of Article 593 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;', 'In that the Court of Appeal in the judgment appealed against upheld the validity of the house searches made by customs officers accompanied by a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire) between 27 January 1977 and 26 February 1980 under Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code, and in particular the one made on 23 January 1979 at the applicant’s home;', 'On the grounds that the Indictment Division cannot rule on the constitutionality of Articles 454 and 64 of the Customs Code in whatever form or context such unconstitutionality is pleaded and that Article 127 of the Criminal Code indeed provides that ‘any judge ... who stays or suspends the application of a statute’ shall be guilty of criminal malfeasance in public office;', 'Whereas, firstly, Article 66 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958 makes the right of State officials to search the home of an offender subject to prior judicial leave, and Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code, which did not provide for any such safeguard, before the promulgation of the Constitution of 4 October 1958, were thus implicitly but necessarily abrogated by the Constitution, which, by Article 62, is directly binding on the courts without that entailing any review of the constitutionality of legislation; and the Indictment Division therefore contravened the aforementioned provisions;', 'Whereas, secondly, the provisions of Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code are incompatible with those of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention ..., which are directly binding on national courts, Article 8 (art. 8) providing for the inviolability of the home; and the Indictment Division thus also contravened the provisions of that treaty;', 'Whereas, in the alternative, Articles 64 and 454 of the Customs Code, assuming that they remained in force after the promulgation of the Constitution of 4 October 1958, require, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, that when administrative officials search a person’s home they must have sought and obtained prior judicial leave; and that the report on the house search is null and void unless it mentions that this formality was complied with; on this account likewise the Indictment Division infringed the aforementioned provisions.""', '17. The Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on 21 January 1985. In relation to the foregoing ground it held:', '""Articles 454 and 64 of the Customs Code, as enacted by the Act of 28 December 1966, are legislative in nature and have never been repealed. It is accordingly not within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to review their constitutionality. Furthermore, the provisions they contain satisfy the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention ..., paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) of which allows interference by a public authority with an individual’s home where such interference is, inter alia, ‘in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, [and] for the prevention of disorder or crime’.""']","['II.

House searches', '(a) The rules applicable at the material time', '20. When the house search was made ( 23 January 1979 ), Article 64 of the Customs Code was worded as follows:', '""1. When searching for goods held unlawfully within the customs territory, except for built-up areas with a population of at least 2,000, and when searching in any place for goods subject to the provisions of Article 215 hereinafter, customs officers may make house searches if accompanied by a local municipal officer or a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire).', '2.

If entry is refused, customs officials may force an entry in the presence of a local municipal officer or a senior police officer.""', '(b) The rules applicable later', '21. The Budget Acts of 30 December 1986 (section 80-I and II) and 29 December 1989 (section 108-III, 1 to 3) amended Article 64, which now provides:', '""1. In order to investigate and establish the customs offences referred to in Articles 414-429 and 459 of this code, customs officers authorised for the purpose by the Director- General of Customs and Excise may make searches of all premises, even private ones, where goods and documents relating to such offences are likely to be held and may seize them. They shall be accompanied by a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire).', '2. (a) Other than in the case of a flagrant offence (flagrant délit ), every search must be authorised by an order of the President of the tribunal de grande instance of the locality in which the customs headquarters responsible for the department in charge of the proceedings is situated, or a judge delegated by him.', 'Against such an order there shall lie only an appeal on points of law as provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure; such an appeal shall not have a suspensive effect. The time within which an appeal on points of law must be brought shall run from the date of notification or service of the order.', 'The order shall contain:', '( i ) where applicable, a mention of the delegation by the President of the tribunal de grande instance;', '(ii) the address of the premises to be searched;', '(iii) the name and position of the authorised official who has sought and obtained leave to make the searches.', 'The judge shall give reasons for his decision by setting out the matters of fact and law that he has accepted and which create a presumption in the case that there have been unlawful activities of which proof is sought.', 'If, during the search, the authorised officials discover the existence of a bank strongbox which belongs to the person occupying the premises searched and in which documents, goods or other items relating to the activities referred to in paragraph 1 above are likely to be found, they may, with leave given by any means by the judge who made the original order, immediately search the strongbox. Such leave shall be mentioned in the report provided for in paragraph 2(b) below.', 'The judge shall take practical steps to check that each application for leave made to him is well-founded; each application shall contain all information in the possession of the customs authorities that may justify the search.', 'He shall designate the senior police officer responsible for being present at the operations and keeping him informed of their progress.', 'The search shall be carried out under the supervision of the judge who has authorised it.

If entry is refused, customs officers may force an entry in the presence of a senior police officer.""', 'B. Prosecution of offences', '22. Article 458 of the Customs Code provides:', '""Offences against the legislation and regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries may be prosecuted only on a complaint by the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance or one of his representatives authorised for the purpose.""', 'C. Compounding', '23. The customs authorities may, in certain circumstances, compound with persons being prosecuted for customs offences or for offences against the legislation and regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries (Article 350 of the Customs Code).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '24. Mr Crémieux applied to the Commission on 11 March 1985, complaining of the searches and seizures made by customs officers at his home and at other addresses of his. He relied on three provisions of the Convention: Article 8 (art. 8) (infringement of his right to respect for his private life, his home and his correspondence); Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3) (non-compliance with mandatory formalities); and Article 10 (art. 10) (failure to respect his freedom of expression).', '25. The Commission declared the application (no. 11471/85) admissible on 19 January 1989. In its report of 8 October 1991 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no breach of Article 8 (art. 8) (by eleven votes to seven), Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3) (unanimously) or Article 10 (art. 10) (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '26. In its memorial the Government asked the Court to dismiss all the complaints made by Mr Crémieux.', '27. Counsel for the applicant asked the Court to', '""hold that there ha[d] been in the instant case a breach of Articles 8, 10 and 6 para. 3 (art. 8, art. 10, art. 6-3) of the ... Convention ...;', 'award just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50), having regard to the substantial non-pecuniary damage sustained, in the sum of FRF 500,000;', 'award costs and expenses, to be paid by the French Republic, in the amount of FRF 100,000;', '...""', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8)', '28. In the applicant’s submission, the house searches and seizures made in the instant case were in breach of Article 8 (art. 8), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', 'A. The Government’s preliminary objection', '29. As they had done before the Commission, the Government raised an objection of inadmissibility on the ground that domestic remedies had not been exhausted in that Mr Crémieux had not complained in the ordinary courts of a flagrantly unlawful act ( voie de fait) on the part of the customs officers and had not sought compensation for it.', '30. Like the applicant and the Commission, the Court notes that Mr Crémieux brought proceedings to have customs reports on the facts and on the seizures declared null and void (see paragraphs 13-17 above) and pursued them to a conclusion, without omitting to plead Article 8 (art. 8). He cannot be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end, is hardly ever used and would in any case probably have been doomed to failure. The objection must therefore be dismissed.', 'B. Merits of the complaint', '31. The Government conceded that there had been an interference with Mr Crémieux’s right to respect for his private life, and the Commission additionally found that there had been an interference with his right to respect for his home.', 'Like Mr Crémieux, the Court considers that all the rights secured in Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1) are in issue, except for the right to respect for family life. It must accordingly be determined whether the interferences in question satisfied the conditions in paragraph 2 (art. 8-2).', '1. ""In accordance with the law""', '32. The applicant contended that the interferences had no legal basis. As worded at the time, Article 64 of the Customs Code was, he claimed, contrary to the 1958 Constitution because it did not make house searches and seizures subject to judicial authorisation. Admittedly, its constitutionality could not be reviewed, since it had come into force before the Constitution had. Nevertheless, in the related field of taxation the Constitutional Council had rejected section 89 of the Budget Act for 1984, concerning the investigation of income-tax and turnover-tax offences, holding, inter alia:', '""While the needs of the Revenue’s work may dictate that tax officials should be authorised to make investigations in private places, such investigations can only be conducted in accordance with Article 66 of the Constitution, which makes the judiciary responsible for protecting the liberty of the individual in all its aspects, in particular the inviolability of the home. Provision must be made for judicial participation in order that the judiciary’s responsibility and supervisory power may be maintained in their entirety."" (Decision no. 83-164 DC of 29 December 1983, Official Gazette (Journal officiel ), 30 December 1983, p. 3874)', '33. The Government, whose arguments the Commission accepted in substance, maintained that in Article 64 of the Customs Code, as supplemented by a fairly substantial body of case-law, the power to search houses was defined very closely and represented a transposition to customs legislation and the regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries of the power of search provided for in ordinary criminal procedure. Provision was first made for it in an Act of 6 August 1791 and subsequently in a legislative decree of 12 July 1934, and it had been widened in 1945 to cover investigations into exchange- control offences and confirmed on several occasions. In the Government’s submission, its constitutionality could not be put in doubt, any more than that of Article 454 of the same code, since review of the constitutionality of statutes took place between their enactment by Parliament and promulgation and was within the sole competence of the Constitutional Council, to the exclusion of all other courts.', 'As to the ""quality"" of the national legal rules vis-à-vis the Convention, it was ensured by the precision with which the legislation and case-law laid down the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant power, and this eliminated any risk of arbitrariness. Thus even before the reform of 1986-89 (see paragraph 21 above), the courts had supervised customs investigations ex post facto but very efficiently. And in any case, Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention contained no requirement that house searches and seizures should be judicially authorised in advance.', '34. The Court does not consider it necessary to determine the issue in this instance, as at all events the interferences complained of are incompatible with Article 8 (art. 8) in other respects (see paragraphs 40-41 below).', '2. Legitimate aim', '35. The Government and the Commission considered that the interferences in question were in the interests of ""the economic well- being of the country"" and ""the prevention of crime"".', 'Notwithstanding the applicant’s arguments to the contrary, the Court is of the view that the interferences were in pursuit of at any rate the first of these legitimate aims.', '3. ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '36. In Mr Crémieux’s submission, the interferences could not be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"". Their scope was unlimited and they had also been carried out in an unacceptable manner. In the first place, their sheer scale was, he said, striking: eighty- three investigative operations spread over three years, although the case was neither serious nor complex and ended with a composition; furthermore, none of the documents removed had proved that any exchange-control offence had been committed. The interferences further reflected a lack of discrimination on the part of the customs officers, who took possession of purely private papers and correspondence and lawyer’s letters and subsequently returned a very large number of the documents seized, which they deemed unnecessary for the investigation. Lastly, the interferences illustrated the authorities’ hounding of the applicant, with the customs searches ( visites domiciliaires ) being turned into thoroughgoing general searches ( perquisitions ).', '37. The Government, whose contentions the Commission accepted in substance, argued that house searches and seizures were the only means available to the authorities for investigating offences against the legislation governing financial dealings with foreign countries and thus preventing the flight of capital and tax evasion. In such fields there was a corpus delicti only very rarely if at all; the ""physical manifestation"" of the offence therefore lay mainly in documents which a guilty party could easily conceal or destroy. Such persons, however, had the benefit of substantial safeguards, strengthened by very rigorous judicial supervision: decision-making by the head of the customs district concerned, the rank of the officers authorised to establish offences, the presence of a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire), the timing of searches, the preservation of lawyers’ and doctors’ professional secrecy, the possibility of invoking the liability of the public authorities, etc. In short, even before the reform of 1986-89, the French system had ensured that there was a proper balance between the requirements of law enforcement and the protection of the rights of the individual.', 'As regards the circumstances of the case, the Government made two observations. Firstly, the composition agreed to by the authorities was tantamount to acknowledgement by Mr Crémieux of the offence committed; far from demonstrating that the case was of little importance, it was an efficient procedure commonly used by the customs to obviate more cumbersome proceedings with identical consequences. Secondly, the many house searches had been made necessary by the number of different places where Mr Crémieux might keep documents.', '38. The Court has consistently held that the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for an interference, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision. The exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) are to be interpreted narrowly (see the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 21, para. 42), and the need for them in a given case must be convincingly established.', '39. Undoubtedly, in the field under consideration - the prevention of capital outflows and tax evasion - States encounter serious difficulties owing to the scale and complexity of banking systems and financial channels and to the immense scope for international investment, made all the easier by the relative porousness of national borders. The Court therefore recognises that they may consider it necessary to have recourse to measures such as house searches and seizures in order to obtain physical evidence of exchange-control offences and, where appropriate, to prosecute those responsible. Nevertheless, the relevant legislation and practice must afford adequate and effective safeguards against abuse (see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, the Klass and Others judgment previously cited, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 50).', '40. This was not so in the instant case. At the material time - and the Court does not have to express an opinion on the legislative reforms of 1986 and 1989, which were designed to afford better protection for individuals (see paragraph 21 above) - the customs authorities had very wide powers; in particular, they had exclusive competence to assess the expediency, number, length and scale of inspections. Above all, in the absence of any requirement of a judicial warrant the restrictions and conditions provided for in law, which were emphasised by the Government (see paragraph 37 above), appear too lax and full of loopholes for the interferences with the applicant’s rights to have been strictly proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.', '41. In sum, there has been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 3 AND ARTICLE 10 (art. 6-3, art. 10)', '42. The applicant also relied on Article 6 para. 3 and Article 10 (art. 6-3, art. 10).', 'The alleged infringements of the rights of the defence and of freedom of expression relate to the same facts as those which the Court has held to have contravened Article 8 (art. 8); in the circumstances of the case, it is unnecessary to consider them separately.', 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '43. Under Article 50 (art. 50),', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Damage', '44. Mr Crémieux claimed, firstly, that he had sustained non- pecuniary damage; he put this at 500,000 French francs (FRF) but left it to the Court to determine in its discretion and in the light of its case-law.', 'The Government and the Delegate of the Commission expressed no opinion.', '45. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered non- pecuniary damage but that this judgment affords him sufficient compensation for it.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '46. Mr Crémieux also sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses he had incurred in the French courts and in the proceedings before the Convention institutions. He assessed these on a lump-sum basis at FRF 100,000; given that the case went back a long way in time and that his first counsel had died, he acknowledged that he was unable to provide a detailed statement of costs.', 'The Government and the Delegate of the Commission did not put forward any view on the issue.', '47. Applying its usual criteria, the Court awards the applicant FRF 50,000.']",2,fr,001-57805,0

Mr Minos Kokkinakis, a retired businessman of Greek nationality, was born into an Orthodox family at Sitia ( Crete ) in 1919. After becoming a Jehovah ’ s Witness in 1936, he was arrested more than sixty times for proselytism. He was also interned and imprisoned on several occasions.', 'The periods of internment, which were ordered by the administrative authorities on the grounds of his activities in religious matters, were spent on various islands in the Aegean (thirteen months in Amorgos in 1938, six in Milos in 1940 and twelve in Makronisos in 1949).', 'The periods of imprisonment, to which he was sentenced by the courts, were for acts of proselytism (three sentences of two and a half months in 1939 - he was the first Jehovah ’ s Witness to be convicted under the Laws of the Metaxas Government (see paragraph 16 below) -, four and a half months in 1949 and two months in 1962), conscientious objection (eighteen and a half months in 1941) and holding a religious meeting in a private house (six months in 1952).', 'Between 1960 and 1970 the applicant was arrested four times and prosecuted but not convicted.', '7. On 2 March 1986 he and his wife called at the home of Mrs Kyriakaki in Sitia and engaged in a discussion with her. Mrs Kyriakaki ’ s husband, who was the cantor at a local Orthodox church, informed the police, who arrested Mr and Mrs Kokkinakis and took them to the local police station, where they spent the night of 2-3 March 1986.', 'A. Proceedings in the Lasithi Criminal Court', '8. The applicant and his wife were prosecuted under section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 making proselytism an offence (see paragraph 16 below) and were committed for trial at the Lasithi Criminal Court ( trimeles plimmeliodikio ), which heard the case on 20 March 1986.', '9. After dismissing an objection that section 4 of that Law was unconstitutional, the Criminal Court heard evidence from Mr and Mrs Kyriakaki, a defence witness and the two defendants and gave judgment on the same day:', '""[The defendants], who belong to the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses sect, attempted to proselytise and, directly or indirectly, to intrude on the religious beliefs of Orthodox Christians, with the intention of undermining those beliefs, by taking advantage of their inexperience, their low intellect and their naïvety. In particular, they went to the home of [Mrs Kyriakaki] ... and told her that they brought good news; by insisting in a pressing manner, they gained admittance to the house and began to read from a book on the Scriptures which they interpreted with reference to a king of heaven, to events which had not yet occurred but would occur, etc., encouraging her by means of their judicious, skilful explanations ... to change her Orthodox Christian beliefs.""', 'The court found Mr and Mrs Kokkinakis guilty of proselytism and sentenced each of them to four months ’ imprisonment, convertible (under Article 82 of the Criminal Code) into a pecuniary penalty of 400 drachmas per day ’ s imprisonment, and a fine of 10,000 drachmas. Under Article 76 of the Criminal Code, it also ordered the confiscation and destruction of four booklets which they had been hoping to sell to Mrs Kyriakaki.', 'B. The proceedings in the Crete Court of Appeal', '10. Mr and Mrs Kokkinakis appealed against this judgment to the Crete Court of Appeal ( Efetio ). The Court of Appeal quashed Mrs Kokkinakis ’ s conviction and upheld her husband ’ s but reduced his prison sentence to three months and converted it into a pecuniary penalty of 400 drachmas per day. The following reasons were given for its judgment, which was delivered on 17 March 1987 :', '""... it was proved that, with the aim of disseminating the articles of faith of the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses sect ( airesi ), to which the defendant adheres, he attempted, directly and indirectly, to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion from his own, [namely] the Orthodox Christian faith, with the intention of changing those beliefs, by taking advantage of her inexperience, her low intellect and her naïvety. More specifically, at the time and place indicated in the operative provision, he visited Mrs Georgia Kyriakaki and after telling her he brought good news, pressed her to let him into the house, where he began by telling her about the politician Olof Palme and by expounding pacifist views. He then took out a little book containing professions of faith by adherents of the aforementioned sect and began to read out passages from Holy Scripture, which he skilfully analysed in a manner that the Christian woman, for want of adequate grounding in doctrine, could not challenge, and at the same time offered her various similar books and importunately tried, directly and indirectly, to undermine her religious beliefs. He must consequently be declared guilty of the above-mentioned offence, in accordance with the operative provision hereinafter, while the other defendant, his wife Elissavet, must be acquitted, seeing that there is no evidence that she participated in the offence committed by her husband, whom she merely accompanied ...""', 'One of the appeal judges dissented, and his opinion, which was appended to the judgment, read as follows:', '""... the first defendant should also have been acquitted, as none of the evidence shows that Georgia Kyriakaki ... was particularly inexperienced in Orthodox Christian doctrine, being married to a cantor, or of particularly low intellect or particularly naïve, such that the defendant was able to take advantage and ... [thus] induce her to become a member of the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses sect.""', 'According to the record of the hearing of 17 March 1987, Mrs Kyriakaki had given the following evidence:', '""They immediately talked to me about Olof Palme, whether he was a pacifist or not, and other subjects that I can ’ t remember. They talked to me about things I did not understand very well. It was not a discussion but a constant monologue by them. ... If they had told me they were Jehovah ’ s Witnesses, I would not have let them in. I don ’ t recall whether they spoke to me about the Kingdom of Heaven. They stayed in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. What they told me was religious in nature, but I don ’ t know why they told it to me. I could not know at the outset what the purpose of their visit was. They may have said something to me at the time with a view to undermining my religious beliefs .... [However,] the discussion did not influence my beliefs ...""', 'C. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation', '11. Mr Kokkinakis appealed on points of law. He maintained, inter alia, that the provisions of Law no. 1363/1938 contravened Article 13 of the Constitution (see paragraph 13 below).', '12. The Court of Cassation ( Arios Pagos ) dismissed the appeal on 22 April 1988. It rejected the plea of unconstitutionality for the following reasons:', '""Section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938, substituted by section 2 of Law no. 1672/1939 providing for the implementation of Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution and enacted under the 1911 Constitution then in force, Article 1 of which prohibited proselytism and any other interference with the dominant religion in Greece, namely the Christian Eastern Orthodox Church, not only does not contravene Article 13 of the 1975 Constitution but is fully compatible with the Constitution, which recognises the inviolability of freedom of conscience in religious matters and provides for freedom to practise any known religion, subject to a formal provision in the same Constitution prohibiting proselytism in that proselytism is forbidden in general whatever the religion against which it is directed, including therefore the dominant religion in Greece, in accordance with Article 3 of the 1975 Constitution, namely the Christian Eastern Orthodox Church.""', 'It also noted that the Crete Court of Appeal had given detailed reasons for its judgment and had complied with the 1975 Constitution in applying the impugned provisions.', 'In the opinion of a dissenting member, the Court of Cassation should have quashed the judgment of the court below for having wrongly applied section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 in that it had made no mention of the promises whereby the defendant had allegedly attempted to intrude on Mrs Kyriakaki ’ s religious beliefs and had given no particulars of Mrs Kyriakaki ’ s inexperience and low intellect.', 'III. THE JEHOVAH ’ S WITNESSES IN GREECE', '22. The Jehovah ’ s Witnesses movement appeared in Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century. Estimates of its membership today vary between 25,000 and 70,000. Members belong to one of 338 congregations, the first of which was formed in Athens in 1922.', '23. Since the revision of the Constitution in 1975 the Supreme Administrative Court has held on several occasions that the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses come within the definition of a ""known religion"" (judgments nos. 2105 and 2106/1975, 4635/1977, 2484/1980, 4620/1985, 790 and 3533/1986 and 3601/1990). Some first-instance courts, however, continue to rule to the contrary ( Heraklion Court of First Instance, judgments nos. 272/1984 and 87/1986). In 1986 the Supreme Administrative Court held (in judgment no. 3533/1986) that a ministerial decision refusing the appointment of a Jehovah ’ s Witness as a literature teacher was contrary to freedom of conscience in religious matters and hence to the Greek Constitution.', '24. According to statistics provided by the applicant, 4,400 Jehovah ’ s Witnesses were arrested between 1975 (when democracy was restored) and 1992, and 1,233 of these were committed for trial and 208 convicted. Earlier, several Jehovah ’ s Witnesses had been convicted under Law no. 117/1936 for the prevention of communism and its effects and Law no. 1075/1938 on preserving the social order.', 'The Government have not challenged the applicant ’ s figures. They have, however, pointed out that there have been signs of a decline in the frequency of convictions of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses, only 7 out of a total of 260 people arrested having been convicted in 1991 and 1992.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. Statutory provisions', '1. The Constitution', '13. The relevant Articles of the 1975 Constitution read as follows:', 'Article 3', '""1. The dominant religion in Greece is that of the Christian Eastern Orthodox Church. The Greek Orthodox Church, which recognises as its head Our Lord Jesus Christ, is indissolubly united, doctrinally, with the Great Church of Constantinople and with any other Christian Church in communion with it ( omodoxi ), immutably observing, like the other Churches, the holy apostolic and synodical canons and the holy traditions. It is autocephalous and is administered by the Holy Synod, composed of all the bishops in office, and by the standing Holy Synod, which is an emanation of it constituted as laid down in the Charter of the Church and in accordance with the provisions of the Patriarchal Tome of 29 June 1850 and the Synodical Act of 4 September 1928.', '2. The ecclesiastical regime in certain regions of the State shall not be deemed contrary to the provisions of the foregoing paragraph.', '3. The text of the Holy Scriptures is unalterable. No official translation into any other form of language may be made without the prior consent of the autocephalous Greek Church and the Great Christian Church at Constantinople .""', 'Article 13', '""1. Freedom of conscience in religious matters is inviolable. The enjoyment of personal and political rights shall not depend on an individual ’ s religious beliefs.', '2. There shall be freedom to practise any known religion; individuals shall be free to perform their rites of worship without hindrance and under the protection of the law. The performance of rites of worship must not prejudice public order or public morals. Proselytism is prohibited.', '3. The ministers of all known religions shall be subject to the same supervision by the State and to the same obligations to it as those of the dominant religion.', '4. No one may be exempted from discharging his obligations to the State or refuse to comply with the law by reason of his religious convictions.', '5. No oath may be required other than under a law which also determines the form of it.""', '14. The Christian Eastern Orthodox Church, which during nearly four centuries of foreign occupation symbolised the maintenance of Greek culture and the Greek language, took an active part in the Greek people ’ s struggle for emancipation, to such an extent that Hellenism is to some extent identified with the Orthodox faith.', 'A royal decree of 23 July 1833 entitled ""Proclamation of the Independence of the Greek Church"" described the Orthodox Church as ""autocephalous"". Greece ’ s successive Constitutions have referred to the Church as being ""dominant"". The overwhelming majority of the population are members of it, and, according to Greek conceptions, it represents de jure and de facto the religion of the State itself, a good number of whose administrative and educational functions (marriage and family law, compulsory religious instruction, oaths sworn by members of the Government, etc.) it moreover carries out. Its role in public life is reflected by, among other things, the presence of the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs at the sessions of the Church hierarchy at which the Archbishop of Athens is elected and by the participation of the Church authorities in all official State events; the President of the Republic takes his oath of office according to Orthodox ritual (Article 33 para. 2 of the Constitution); and the official calendar follows that of the Christian Eastern Orthodox Church.', '15. Under the reign of Otto I (1832-62), the Orthodox Church, which had long complained of a Bible society ’ s propaganda directed at young Orthodox schoolchildren on behalf of the Evangelical Church, managed to get a clause added to the first Constitution (1844) forbidding ""proselytism and any other action against the dominant religion"". The Constitutions of 1864, 1911 and 1952 reproduced the same clause. The 1975 Constitution prohibits proselytism in general (Article 13 para. 2 in fine - see paragraph 13 above): the ban covers all ""known religions"", meaning those whose doctrines are not apocryphal and in which no secret initiation is required of neophytes.', '2. Laws nos. 1363/1938 and 1672/1939', '16. During the dictatorship of Metaxas (1936-40) proselytism was made a criminal offence for the first time by section 4 of Law ( anagastikos nomos ) no. 1363/1938. The following year that section was amended by section 2 of Law no. 1672/1939, in which the meaning of the term ""proselytism"" was clarified:', '""1. Anyone engaging in proselytism shall be liable to imprisonment and a fine of between 1,000 and 50,000 drachmas; he shall, moreover, be subject to police supervision for a period of between six months and one year to be fixed by the court when convicting the offender.', 'The term of imprisonment may not be commuted to a fine.', '2. By ‘ proselytism ’ is meant, in particular, any direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion ( eterodoxos ), with the aim of undermining those beliefs, either by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of his inexperience, trust, need, low intellect or naïvety.', '3. The commission of such an offence in a school or other educational establishment or a philanthropic institution shall constitute a particularly aggravating circumstance.""', 'B. Case-law', '17. In a judgment numbered 2276/1953 a full court of the Supreme Administrative Court ( Symvoulio tis Epikratias ) gave the following definition of proselytism:', '""Article 1 of the Constitution, which establishes the freedom to practise any known religion and to perform rites of worship without hindrance and prohibits proselytism and all other activities directed against the dominant religion, that of the Christian Eastern Orthodox Church, means that purely spiritual teaching does not amount to proselytism, even if it demonstrates the errors of other religions and entices possible disciples away from them, who abandon their original religions of their own free will; this is because spiritual teaching is in the nature of a rite of worship performed freely and without hindrance. Outside such spiritual teaching, which may be freely given, any determined, importunate attempt to entice disciples away from the dominant religion by means that are unlawful or morally reprehensible constitutes proselytism as prohibited by the aforementioned provision of the Constitution.""', '18. The Greek courts have held that persons were guilty of proselytism who had: likened the saints to ""figures adorning the wall"", St Gerasimos to ""a body stuffed with cotton"" and the Church to ""a theatre, a market, a cinema""; preached, while displaying a painting showing a crowd of wretched people in rags, that ""such are all those who do not embrace my faith"" (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 271/1932, Themis XVII, p. 19); promised Orthodox refugees housing on specially favourable terms if they adhered to the Uniate faith (Court of Appeal of the Aegean, judgment no. 2950/1930, Themis B, p. 103); offered a scholarship for study abroad (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 2276/1953); sent Orthodox priests booklets with the recommendation that they should study them and apply their content (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 59/1956, Nomiko Vima, 1956, no. 4, p. 736); distributed ""so-called religious"" books and booklets free to ""illiterate peasants"" or to ""young schoolchildren"" (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 201/1961, Criminal Annals XI, p. 472); or promised a young seamstress an improvement in her position if she left the Orthodox Church, whose priests were alleged to be ""exploiters of society"" (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 498/1961, Criminal Annals XII, p. 212).', 'The Court of Cassation has ruled that the definition of proselytism in section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 does not contravene the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. The Piraeus Criminal Court followed it in an order ( voulevma ) numbered 36/1962 (Greek Lawyers ’ Journal, 1962, p. 421), adding that the expression ""in particular"" in section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 (see paragraph 16 above) referred to the means used by the person committing the offence and not to the description of the actus reus.', '19. Until 1975 the Court of Cassation held that the list in section 4 was not exhaustive. In a judgment numbered 997/1975 (Criminal Annals XXVI, p. 380) it added the following clarification:', '""... it follows from the provisions of section 4 ... that proselytism consists in a direct or indirect attempt to impinge on religious beliefs by any of the means separately listed in the Law.""', '20. More recently courts have convicted Jehovah ’ s Witnesses for professing the sect ’ s doctrine ""importunately"" and accusing the Orthodox Church of being a ""source of suffering for the world"" ( Salonika Court of Appeal, judgment no. 2567/1988); for entering other people ’ s homes in the guise of Christians wishing to spread the New Testament ( Florina Court of First Instance, judgment no. 128/1989); and for attempting to give books and booklets to an Orthodox priest at the wheel of his car after stopping him ( Lasithi Court of First Instance, judgment no. 357/1990).', 'In a judgment numbered 1304/1982 (Criminal Annals XXXII, p. 502), on the other hand, the Court of Cassation quashed a judgment of the Athens Court of Appeal (no. 5434/1981) as having no basis in law because, when convicting a Jehovah ’ s Witness, the Court of Appeal had merely reiterated the words of the indictment and had thus not explained how ""the importunate teaching of the doctrines of the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses sect"" or ""distribution of the sect ’ s booklets at a minimal price"" had amounted to an attempt to intrude on the complainants ’ religious beliefs, or shown how the defendant had taken advantage of their ""inexperience"" and ""low intellect"". The Court of Cassation remitted the case to a differently constituted bench of the Court of Appeal, which acquitted the defendant.', 'Similarly, it has been held in several court decisions that the offence of proselytism was not made out where there had merely been a discussion about the beliefs of the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses, where booklets had been distributed from door to door ( Patras Court of Appeal, judgment no. 137/1988) or in the street (Larissa Court of Appeal, judgment no. 749/1986) or where the tenets of the sect had been explained without any deception to an Orthodox Christian ( Trikkala Criminal Court, judgment no. 186/1986). Lastly, it has been held that being an ""illiterate peasant"" is not sufficient to establish the ""naïvety"", referred to in section 4, of the person whom the alleged proselytiser is addressing (Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1155/1978).', '21. After the revision of the Constitution in 1975, the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses brought legal proceedings to challenge the constitutionality of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938. They complained that the description of the offence was vague, but above all they objected to the actual title of the Law, which indicated that the Law was designed to preserve Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution in force at the time (the 1911 Constitution - see paragraph 12 above), which prohibited proselytism directed against the dominant religion. In the current Constitution this prohibition is extended to all religions and furthermore is no longer included in the chapter concerning religion but in the one dealing with civil and social rights, and more particularly in Article 13, which guarantees freedom of conscience in religious matters.', 'The courts have always dismissed such objections of unconstitutionality, although they have been widely supported in legal literature.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '25. Mr Kokkinakis applied to the Commission on 22 August 1988. He claimed that his conviction for proselytism was in breach of the rights secured in Articles 7, 9 and 10 (art. 7, art. 9, art. 10) of the Convention. He also relied on Article 5 para. 1 and Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (art. 5-1, art. 6-1, art. 6-2).', '26. The Commission declared the application (no. 14307/88) admissible on 7 December 1990 except for the complaints based on Articles 5 and 6 (art. 5, art. 6), which it declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. In its report of 3 December 1991 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that', '(a) there had been no violation of Article 7 (art. 7) (by eleven votes to two);', '(b) there had been a violation of Article 9 (art. 9) (unanimously); and', '(c) no separate issue arose under Article 10 (art. 10) (by twelve votes to one).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', '27. Mr Kokkinakis complained of his conviction for proselytism; he considered it contrary to Articles 7, 9 and 10 (art. 7, art. 9, art. 10) of the Convention, and to Article 14 taken together with Article 9 (art. 14+9).', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 9 (art. 9)', '28. The applicant ’ s complaints mainly concerned a restriction on the exercise of his freedom of religion. The Court will accordingly begin by looking at the issues relating to Article 9 (art. 9), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.', '2. Freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', '29. The applicant did not only challenge what he claimed to be the wrongful application to him of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938. His submission concentrated on the broader problem of whether that enactment was compatible with the right enshrined in Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention, which, he argued, having been part of Greek law since 1953, took precedence under the Constitution over any contrary statute. He pointed to the logical and legal difficulty of drawing any even remotely clear dividing-line between proselytism and freedom to change one ’ s religion or belief and, either alone or in community with others, in public and in private, to manifest it, which encompassed all forms of teaching, publication and preaching between people.', 'The ban on proselytism, which was made a criminal offence during the Metaxas dictatorship, was not only unconstitutional, Mr Kokkinakis submitted, but it also formed, together with the other clauses of Law no. 1363/1938, ""an arsenal of prohibitions and threats of punishment"" hanging over the adherents of all beliefs and all creeds.', 'Mr Kokkinakis complained, lastly, of the selective application of this Law by the administrative and judicial authorities; it would surpass ""even the wildest academic hypothesis"" to imagine, for example, the possibility of a complaint being made by a Catholic priest or by a Protestant clergyman against an Orthodox Christian who had attempted to entice one of his flock away from him. It was even less likely that an Orthodox Christian would be prosecuted for proselytising on behalf of the ""dominant religion"".', '30. In the Government ’ s submission, there was freedom to practise all religions in Greece; religious adherents enjoyed the right both to express their beliefs freely and to try to influence the beliefs of others, Christian witness being a duty of all Churches and all Christians. There was, however, a radical difference between bearing witness and ""proselytism that is not respectable"", the kind that consists in using deceitful, unworthy and immoral means, such as exploiting the destitution, low intellect and inexperience of one ’ s fellow beings. Section 4 prohibited this kind of proselytism - the ""misplaced"" proselytism to which the European Court referred in its Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark judgment of 7 December 1976 (Series A no. 23, p. 28, para. 54) - and not straightforward religious teaching. Furthermore, it was precisely this definition of proselytism that had been adopted by the Greek courts.', 'A. General principles', '31. As enshrined in Article 9 (art. 9), freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a ""democratic society"" within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it.', 'While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to ""manifest [one ’ s] religion"". Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions.', 'According to Article 9 (art. 9), freedom to manifest one ’ s religion is not only exercisable in community with others, ""in public"" and within the circle of those whose faith one shares, but can also be asserted ""alone"" and ""in private""; furthermore, it includes in principle the right to try to convince one ’ s neighbour, for example through ""teaching"", failing which, moreover, ""freedom to change [one ’ s] religion or belief"", enshrined in Article 9 (art. 9), would be likely to remain a dead letter.', '32. The requirements of Article 9 (art. 9) are reflected in the Greek Constitution in so far as Article 13 of the latter declares that freedom of conscience in religious matters is inviolable and that there shall be freedom to practise any known religion (see paragraph 13 above). Jehovah ’ s Witnesses accordingly enjoy both the status of a ""known religion"" and the advantages flowing from that as regards observance (see paragraphs 22-23 above).', '33. The fundamental nature of the rights guaranteed in Article 9 para. 1 (art. 9-1) is also reflected in the wording of the paragraph providing for limitations on them. Unlike the second paragraphs of Articles 8, 10 and 11 (art. 8-2, art. 10-2, art, 11-2) which cover all the rights mentioned in the first paragraphs of those Articles (art. 8-1, art. 10-1, art. 11-1), that of Article 9 (art. 9-1) refers only to ""freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or belief"". In so doing, it recognises that in democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on this freedom in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone ’ s beliefs are respected.', '34. According to the Government, such restrictions were to be found in the Greek legal system. Article 13 of the 1975 Constitution forbade proselytism in respect of all religions without distinction; and section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938, which attached a criminal penalty to this prohibition, had been upheld by several successive democratic governments notwithstanding its historical and political origins. The sole aim of section 4 was to protect the beliefs of others from activities which undermined their dignity and personality.', '35. The Court will confine its attention as far as possible to the issue raised by the specific case before it. It must nevertheless look at the foregoing provisions, since the action complained of by the applicant arose from the application of them (see, mutatis mutandis, the de Geouffre de la Pradelle v. France judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 253-B, p. 42, para. 31).', 'B. Application of the principles', '36. The sentence passed by the Lasithi Criminal Court and subsequently reduced by the Crete Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 9-10 above) amounts to an interference with the exercise of Mr Kokkinakis ’ s right to ""freedom to manifest [his] religion or belief"". Such an interference is contrary to Article 9 (art. 9) unless it is ""prescribed by law"", directed at one or more of the legitimate aims in paragraph 2 (art. 9-2) and ""necessary in a democratic society"" for achieving them.', '1. ""Prescribed by law""', '37. The applicant said that his submissions relating to Article 7 (art. 7) also applied to the phrase ""prescribed by law"". The Court will therefore examine them from this point of view.', '38. Mr Kokkinakis impugned the very wording of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938. He criticised the absence of any description of the ""objective substance"" of the offence of proselytism. He thought this deliberate, as it would tend to make it possible for any kind of religious conversation or communication to be caught by the provision. He referred to the risk of ""extendibility"" by the police and often by the courts too of the vague terms of the section, such as ""in particular"" and ""indirect attempt"" to intrude on the religious beliefs of others. Punishing a non-Orthodox Christian even when he was offering ""moral support or material assistance"" was tantamount to punishing an act that any religion would prescribe and that the Criminal Code required in certain emergencies. Law no. 1672/1939 (see paragraph 16 above) had, without more, stripped the initial wording of section 4 of its ""repetitive verbiage""; it had retained all the ""extendible, catch-all"" expressions, merely using a more concise but equally ""pedantic"" style designed to ensure that non-Orthodox Christians were permanently gagged. Consequently, no citizen could regulate his conduct on the basis of this enactment.', 'Furthermore, section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 was incompatible with Article 13 of the Constitution.', '39. The Government, on the other hand, maintained that section 4 defined proselytism precisely and specifically; it listed all the ingredients of the offence. The use of the adverbial phrase ""in particular"" was of no importance, as it related only to the means by which the offence could be committed; indicative lists of this kind were, moreover, commonly included in criminal statutes.', 'Lastly, the objective substance of the offence was not lacking but consisted in the attempt to change the essentials of the religious beliefs of others.', '40. The Court has already noted that the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, for example and mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 20, para. 29). Criminal-law provisions on proselytism fall within this category. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice.', 'In this instance there existed a body of settled national case-law (see paragraphs 17-20 above). This case-law, which had been published and was accessible, supplemented the letter of section 4 and was such as to enable Mr Kokkinakis to regulate his conduct in the matter.', 'As to the constitutionality of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938, the Court reiterates that it is, in the first instance, for the national authorities, and in particular the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, as the most recent authority, the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 252, p. 18, para. 42). And the Greek courts that have had to deal with the issue have ruled that there is no incompatibility (see paragraph 21 above).', '41. The measure complained of was therefore ""prescribed by law"" within the meaning of Article 9 para. 2 (art. 9-2) of the Convention.', '2. Legitimate aim', '42. The Government contended that a democratic State had to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the personal freedoms of all those living on its territory. If, in particular, it was not vigilant to protect a person ’ s religious beliefs and dignity from attempts to influence them by immoral and deceitful means, Article 9 para. 2 (art. 9-2) would in practice be rendered wholly nugatory.', '43. In the applicant ’ s submission, religion was part of the ""constantly renewable flow of human thought"" and it was impossible to conceive of its being excluded from public debate. A fair balance of personal rights made it necessary to accept that others ’ thought should be subject to a minimum of influence, otherwise the result would be a ""strange society of silent animals that [would] think but ... not express themselves, that [would] talk but ... not communicate, and that [would] exist but ... not coexist"".', '44. Having regard to the circumstances of the case and the actual terms of the relevant courts ’ decisions, the Court considers that the impugned measure was in pursuit of a legitimate aim under Article 9 para. 2 (art. 9-2), namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, relied on by the Government.', '3. ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '45. Mr Kokkinakis did not consider it necessary in a democratic society to prohibit a fellow citizen ’ s right to speak when he came to discuss religion with his neighbour. He was curious to know how a discourse delivered with conviction and based on holy books common to all Christians could infringe the rights of others. Mrs Kyriakaki was an experienced adult woman with intellectual abilities; it was not possible, without flouting fundamental human rights, to make it a criminal offence for a Jehovah ’ s Witness to have a conversation with a cantor ’ s wife. Moreover, the Crete Court of Appeal, although the facts before it were precise and absolutely clear, had not managed to determine the direct or indirect nature of the applicant ’ s attempt to intrude on the complainant ’ s religious beliefs; its reasoning showed that it had convicted the applicant ""not for something he had done but for what he was"".', 'The Commission accepted this argument in substance.', '46. The Government maintained, on the contrary, that the Greek courts had based themselves on plain facts which amounted to the offence of proselytism: Mr Kokkinakis ’ s insistence on entering Mrs Kyriakaki ’ s home on a false pretext; the way in which he had approached her in order to gain her trust; and his ""skilful"" analysis of the Holy Scriptures calculated to ""delude"" the complainant, who did not possess any ""adequate grounding in doctrine"" (see paragraphs 9-10 above). They pointed out that if the State remained indifferent to attacks on freedom of religious belief, major unrest would be caused that would probably disturb the social peace.', '47. The Court has consistently held that a certain margin of appreciation is to be left to the Contracting States in assessing the existence and extent of the necessity of an interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court ’ s task is to determine whether the measures taken at national level were justified in principle and proportionate.', 'In order to rule on this latter point, the Court must weigh the requirements of the protection of the rights and liberties of others against the conduct of which the applicant stood accused. In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned judicial decisions against the background of the case as a whole (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, para. 28).', '48. First of all, a distinction has to be made between bearing Christian witness and improper proselytism. The former corresponds to true evangelism, which a report drawn up in 1956 under the auspices of the World Council of Churches describes as an essential mission and a responsibility of every Christian and every Church. The latter represents a corruption or deformation of it. It may, according to the same report, take the form of activities offering material or social advantages with a view to gaining new members for a Church or exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need; it may even entail the use of violence or brainwashing; more generally, it is not compatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others.', 'Scrutiny of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 shows that the relevant criteria adopted by the Greek legislature are reconcilable with the foregoing if and in so far as they are designed only to punish improper proselytism, which the Court does not have to define in the abstract in the present case.', '49. The Court notes, however, that in their reasoning the Greek courts established the applicant ’ s liability by merely reproducing the wording of section 4 and did not sufficiently specify in what way the accused had attempted to convince his neighbour by improper means. None of the facts they set out warrants that finding.', 'That being so, it has not been shown that the applicant ’ s conviction was justified in the circumstances of the case by a pressing social need. The contested measure therefore does not appear to have been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued or, consequently, ""necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"".', '50. In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 (art. 7)', '51. Mr Kokkinakis also relied on Article 7 (art. 7), which provides:', '""1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.""', 'In his submission, for a criminal provision to be compatible with this Article (art. 7) it must be sufficiently precise and clear (see paragraphs 37-38 above). This was not the case, he said, with section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938.', '52. The Court points out that Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy; it follows from this that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This condition is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him liable.', 'It appears that this was indeed so in the present case; on this point the Court refers to paragraphs 40-41 of this judgment.', '53. In conclusion, there has been no breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '54. The applicant further relied on his freedom of expression, as secured in Article 10 (art. 10). His conviction, he said, struck not only at the dissemination of his religious opinions but also at that of general socio-philosophical opinions, since the Crete Court of Appeal had noted that he had talked to Mrs Kyriakaki about the politician Olof Palme and had expounded pacifist views.', '55. Having regard to its decision on Article 9 (art. 9) (see paragraph 50 above), the Court, like the Commission, considers it unnecessary to examine this complaint.', 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 9 (art. 14+9)', '56. In his memorial of 5 August 1992 the applicant also claimed to be the victim of discrimination contrary to Article 14 taken together with Article 9 (art. 14+9). He submitted that discrimination arose from the defects in section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 or from the use made of it.', '57. Although not raised before the Commission, this complaint relates to the same facts as do those made under Articles 7 and 9 (art. 7, art. 9); having regard to the conclusion in paragraph 50 above, however, the Court holds that it is unnecessary to deal with it.', 'V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '58. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', '59. At the hearing the applicant sought, firstly, compensation in the amount of 500,000 drachmas (GRD) for non-pecuniary damage.', 'The Court considers that he has sustained such damage and that, notwithstanding the Government ’ s opinion to the contrary, a finding of a breach is not sufficient to compensate him for it. Making its assessment on an equitable basis as required by Article 50 (art. 50), it awards him GRD 400,000 under this head.', '60. For costs and expenses relating to the proceedings in Greece and before the Convention institutions Mr Kokkinakis sought the sum of GRD 2,789,500, of which he provided particulars.', 'The Government judged this amount to be excessive. More especially, they contested the need (a) for the applicant to be represented by two lawyers in the Greek courts and before the European Court and for him to be defended by Athenian lawyers in the Cretan courts; and (b) for Mr Kokkinakis to have attended the Court of Cassation hearing.', 'Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court nevertheless finds the claim reasonable, and consequently allows it in full.']",2,gr,001-57827,0

He is a taxi driver and resides in Reykjavik.', '8. On 24 October 1984 he was granted a licence to operate a taxicab by the ""licence issuers"" (a body later named the Committee for Taxicab Supervision - the ""Committee""; see paragraphs 18 and 20 below). The decision was taken under Law no. 36/1970 on Motor Vehicles for Public Hire (""the 1970 Law"") and Regulation no. 320/1983 (""the 1983 Regulation"") issued by the Minister of Transport under Article 10 of the Law (see paragraph 18 below).', 'The applicant had applied for a licence using a printed form addressed to the Frami Automobile Association (""Frami""). This standard form contained a statement to the effect that the applicant was aware of the obligation to pay membership fees to Frami on becoming a member.', 'When he was granted the licence, the applicant undertook to observe the conditions provided for in the 1983 Regulation, on the understanding that a failure to do so could lead to its suspension or revocation. One such condition was that he apply for membership of Frami (Article 8 of the 1983 Regulation), which he had done on 26 September 1984.', '9. After joining Frami, the applicant paid membership fees to the association until August 1985, when he stopped doing so. As a result, Frami advised him on 5 February 1986 that it intended to exclude him and his taxicab from taxi station services until the fees were paid (Article 27 of Frami ’ s Articles of Association).', 'In reply, the applicant, by letter of 14 February 1986, indicated that he did not wish to be a member of Frami; he refused to accept the obligation to remain a member of and to pay membership fees to it. Furthermore, he explained that he had accepted the licence ""without first ascertain[ ing ] [his] legal position with regard to membership"" because he had lacked sufficient funds to take the necessary steps. Also he had preferred to avoid time-consuming litigation which would have delayed the granting of the licence.', '10. On 30 June 1986 the Committee upheld a request by Frami for the revocation of the applicant ’ s licence, especially because he had ceased paying membership dues.', '11. In a letter of 1 July 1986 to the Ministry of Transport (""the Ministry"") the applicant protested against the revocation of his licence and requested the suspension of the revocation pending the decision of a court action which he intended to take.', '12. In its reply dated 17 July 1986, the Ministry, referring to Articles 7 and 12 of Regulation no. 293/1985 (see paragraph 18 below), confirmed the revocation. A copy of this letter was addressed to the Reykjavik Chief of Police.', '13. By letter of 28 July 1986, the applicant ’ s lawyer informed the Chief of Police that the applicant considered the revocation unlawful; he intended to bring the matter before the courts and asked the police not to interfere with his taxi business. However, on 1 August 1986, while driving his taxi, the applicant was stopped by the police, who removed the plates identifying his vehicle as one for public hire.', '14. On 18 September 1986 the applicant instituted proceedings against both the Committee and the Ministry before the Civil Court of Reykjavik, seeking a declaration that the revocation was null and void.', 'The Civil Court dismissed his claim on 17 July 1987.', '15. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court.', 'By judgment of 15 December 1988, the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary with seven members, unanimously rejected his claim that, in view of Article 73 of the Constitution, he could not be obliged to remain a member of Frami. In its opinion, the drafting history of this Article showed that it was intended to guarantee only a right to ""form associations"", not a right to remain outside one. The applicant had not made out his allegation that, if construed in this manner, Article 73 conflicted with the relevant provisions of international instruments. Finally, it could not be inferred from the Article that a business licence could not lawfully be made conditional upon membership of an association.', 'On the other hand, the Supreme Court, by a majority of four, annulled the revocation of the applicant ’ s licence. It found that the provision in the 1983 Regulation imposing trade-union membership as a prerequisite for granting a licence (see paragraph 8 above) lacked a statutory basis.', '16. Following the above-mentioned ruling by the Supreme Court, the Althing (the Icelandic Parliament) enacted new legislation - Law no. 77/1989 on Motor Vehicles for Public Hire (""the 1989 Law"") - which made operating licences conditional upon trade-union membership. This entered into force on 1 July 1989 (see paragraph 18 below).', '17. In a letter to Frami dated 4 July 1989, a copy of which was transmitted to the Ministry, the applicant stated that, in the light of the new legislation, he had no choice but to be a member of the association and that he therefore agreed to pay membership fees. At the same time he stressed that membership was contrary to his own wishes and interests; not only did Frami ’ s Articles contain provisions contrary to his political opinions, but the association also used the revenue from membership fees to work against his interests. In addition, he maintained that the new legislation providing for obligatory membership was incompatible with the Convention and expressed his intention to pursue the matter before the Convention institutions.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. Introduction', '18. At the time when the applicant was granted a taxicab licence, such licences were governed by the 1970 Law on Motor Vehicles for Public Hire and the 1983 Regulation. The latter was subsequently amended by Regulation no. 293/1985 (""the 1985 Regulation""): the body previously called the ""licence issuers"" was thereafter to be known as the Committee for Taxicab Supervision (see paragraph 20 below).', 'In 1989 the 1970 Law and the 1985 Regulation were replaced by the 1989 Law on Motor Vehicles for Public Hire and Regulation no. 308/1989 (""the 1989 Regulation""). The applicant ’ s original complaint to the Commission was concerned only with the situation after the entry into force of the 1989 legislation on 1 July 1989 (see under the heading ""Complaints"", in Appendix II of the Commission ’ s report).', 'B. Organisation and administration of licences to operate a taxicab', '19. Under Article 4 of the 1989 Law, the Ministry may, at the request of a trade union ( stéttarfélag ) of automobile drivers and on the recommendation of the town council and the regional board, limit the number of motor vehicles for public hire within the trade union area.', 'Restrictions on the number of taxicabs are set out in Article 8 of the 1989 Regulation which provides, inter alia, that within Frami ’ s area, which comprises Reykjavik and six surrounding communities, the number of taxicabs is to be limited to 570. Such limitations are to be effected by the issuing of licences, each licence-holder being required, among other conditions, to own a passenger car and to use it as a taxi himself as his main occupation (Article 7 of the 1989 Law and Article 8 of the 1989 Regulation). Taxi business within the area in issue is to be carried on from a taxi station approved by the municipal council (Article 2 of the 1989 Law).', '20. In a trade-union area where limitations have been placed on the number of vehicles for public hire, a Committee for Taxicab Supervision composed of three members appointed by the Minister of Transport is set up. Two of the members are nominated; one by the relevant trade union, the other by the municipality. The third member chairs the Committee (Article 10 of the 1989 Law). The Committee adopts its own rules of procedure, subject to endorsement by the Ministry; it takes its decisions by a majority and reports annually to the Ministry (Article 10 of the 1989 Law and Article 9 of the 1989 Regulation).', 'The Committee ’ s task is to ""supervise and control"", within the area of the trade union in question, the implementation of laws and regulations relating to the operation of vehicles for public hire; the issuing and revocation of operating licences; and the manner in which taxi stations provide their services (Article 10 of the 1989 Law).', '21. Frami (until 1959 named Hreyfill ) was formed in 1936 by professional automobile drivers in Reykjavik. Its Articles, which may be amended by the association itself (clause 32 of the Articles), are not subject to governmental approval. According to clause 2 of the Articles, the purpose of the association is: (1) to protect the professional interests of its members and promote solidarity among professional taxicab drivers; (2) to determine, negotiate and present demands relating to working hours, wages and rates of its members; (3) to seek to maintain limitations on the number of taxicabs and (4) to represent its members before the public authorities.', 'The Articles are currently under revision.', '22. Under the 1989 rules, associations such as Frami have certain administrative functions, namely:', '(a) they propose such limitations as mentioned in paragraph 19 above (Article 4 of the 1989 Law);', '(b) they serve as a depository for licences (Article 13 of the 1989 Regulation);', '(c) they approve the suitability of vehicles for use as taxicabs (Article 14 of the 1989 Regulation);', '(d) within narrow limits specified in the 1989 rules, they regulate, and decide on requests for, temporary exemption from the requirement that the licence-holder personally operate his own taxicab (Article 9 of the 1989 Law and Article 16 of the 1989 Regulation).', '23. In addition to the above, according to material submitted by the Government, Frami carries out the following tasks:', '(a) it supervises the performance of taxi services;', '(b) it reports to the Committee instances of failure by a licence-holder to observe the licence conditions;', '(c) it regulates the operation of taxicabs to ensure that the level of services corresponds to the significantly higher demand at weekends;', '(d) it monitors the fulfilment by licence-holders of registration and insurance requirements and payment by them of requisite charges;', '(e) it fixes the rates for taxi services, subject to approval by the price-control authorities.', 'Frami does not engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members and is therefore not affiliated to the Icelandic Federation of Labour.', 'C. Obligation of membership', '24. Article 5 of the 1989 Law provides that within a trade-union area where a limitation on the number of vehicles for public hire applies (see paragraph 19 above), operators of vehicles of the same category are to be members of the same trade union. If there is a trade union of taxicab operators for a particular area, persons not possessing an operating licence are prohibited from carrying out taxi services in that area.', 'Pursuant to Article 8 of the 1989 Law, an operating licence may be granted only to a person who is a member, or has applied for membership, of the relevant trade union. It follows from Article 8 of the 1989 Regulation (see paragraph 19 above) that Frami is the relevant association for taxi licence-holders in Reykjavik. The membership condition continues to apply after a licence has been granted.', '25. In the case of violations by a licence-holder of laws or regulations relating to motor vehicles for public hire, he may receive an admonition from the Committee, his licence may be suspended or, in the event of serious or recurring violations, revoked by the Committee and the licence-holder may be liable to pay a fine; if it is revoked, he may, on certain conditions, reapply for a licence after five years (Articles 9 and 13 of the 1989 Law and Article 18 of the 1989 Regulation).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '26. In his application (no. 16130/90) lodged with the Commission on 22 December 1989, Mr Sigurdur A. Sigurjónsson alleged a violation of Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention (right to freedom of association) or, in the alternative, Articles 9 (art. 9) (right to freedom of thought and conscience), 10 (art. 10) (right to freedom of expression) and 13 (art. 13) (right to an effective remedy).', '27. On 10 July 1991 the Commission declared the application admissible.', 'In its report adopted on 15 May 1992 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion:', '(a) by seventeen votes to one, that there had been a violation of Article 11 (art. 11);', '(b) unanimously, that it was not necessary to examine separately whether there had been a violation of Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10);', '(c) unanimously, that there had been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT', '28. At the hearing on 22 February 1993, the Government invited the Court to hold, as submitted in their memorial of 15 December 1992, that there had been no violation of the Convention in the present case.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11 (art. 11)', '29. The applicant alleged that the obligation incumbent on him to be a member of Frami on pain of losing his licence constituted a violation of Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention, which reads:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.""', 'The Government disputed this contention, whereas the Commission agreed.', 'A. The existence of an interference with a right guaranteed by Article 11 (art. 11)', '1. Whether Frami was an ""association""', '30. The Government contended that Frami was not a ""trade union"", nor even an ""association"", within the meaning of Article 11 (art. 11), but a professional organisation of a public-law character. They invoked mainly the following arguments:', '(a) Although not established by law, Frami performed certain functions which were provided for by law or had evolved through practice and served the public interest no less than the interests of its members (see paragraphs 22-23 above). Frami was thus the lowest administrative level in a hierarchy comprising, apart from Frami itself, the Committee and the Ministry.', '(b) Frami was not an employees ’ organisation representing its members in conflicts with their employer or engaging in collective bargaining and was not affiliated to the Icelandic Federation of Labour. Instead, it had a membership composed principally of independent business operators and itself fixed the rates for services, any changes in which were subject to the approval of the price-control authorities.', '31. The Court agrees with the applicant and the Commission that the above-mentioned elements are not sufficient for Frami to be regarded as a public-law association outside the ambit of Article 11 (art. 11). Admittedly, Frami performed certain functions which were to some extent provided for in the applicable legislation and which served not only its members but also the public at large (see paragraphs 22-23 above). However, the role of supervision of the implementation of the relevant rules was entrusted primarily to another institution, namely the Committee, which in addition had the power to issue licences and to decide on their suspension and revocation (see paragraphs 20 and 25 above). Frami was established under private law and enjoyed full autonomy in determining its own aims, organisation and procedure. According to its Articles, admittedly old and currently under revision, the purpose of Frami was to protect the professional interests of its members and promote solidarity among professional taxicab drivers; to determine, negotiate and present demands relating to the working hours, wages and rates of its members; to seek to maintain limitations on the number of taxicabs and to represent its members before the public authorities (see paragraph 21 above). Frami was therefore predominantly a private-law organisation and must thus be considered an ""association"" for the purposes of Article 11 (art. 11).', '32. It is not necessary to decide whether Frami can also be regarded as a trade union within the meaning of Article 11 (art. 11), since the right to form and join trade unions in that provision is an aspect of the wider right to freedom of association, rather than a separate right (see, amongst other authorities, the Schmidt and Dahlström v. Sweden judgment of 6 February 1976, Series A no. 21, p. 15, para. 34).', '2. Whether the right claimed by the applicant was covered by Article 11 (art. 11)', '33. The Government, whilst accepting the view enunciated in the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981 (Series A no. 44, pp. 21-22, para. 52) that the negative aspect of the right to freedom of association does not fall completely outside the ambit of Article 11 (art. 11), contested that it extended as far as encompassing a right for the applicant not to be a member of Frami. They contended that such a negative right must be interpreted restrictively, bearing in mind a passage in the travaux préparatoires cited in that judgment, which showed that a general rule, modelled on Article 20 para. 2 of the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that no one may be compelled to belong to an association, had deliberately been omitted from the Convention (ibid., paras. 51-52).', 'Furthermore, they maintained that the present case should be distinguished from the 1981 case in view of the following factors:', '(a) In the latter instance, the applicants had been employed for a considerable time when their employer concluded the impugned agreements with the trade unions - with the effect that they had to join one of the unions or lose their job. The position in the proceedings now before the Court was quite different in that the membership obligation existed before the applicant was granted a licence in 1984, on which occasion he unreservedly and without compulsion agreed to become a member of Frami. Although the Supreme Court ’ s December 1988 judgment (see paragraph 15 above) could be taken to mean that he had not been obliged under Icelandic law to join Frami in 1984, there was, nevertheless, a de facto obligation so to do. Anyhow, the applicant was entirely free either to accept this or to seek employment in another field.', '(b) His objections to membership of Frami could not be compared to those of Mr Young and Mr Webster, both of whom had been opposed to trade-union policies and activities and one of them, to the unions ’ political affiliations.', '(c) Whilst the organisation at issue here was non-political, the 1981 case had concerned a type of association - a trade union - which was frequently affiliated to political parties or otherwise involved in politics and was thus likely to interfere with its members ’ enjoyment of the Convention freedoms, notably the freedom of opinion.', 'The Government submitted that should the Court find that the applicant was protected by Article 11 (art. 11) it would mean a step further than the Young, James and Webster judgment and the above-mentioned passage in the travaux préparatoires would be rendered nugatory.', '34. Both the applicant and the Commission were of the view that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of association as covered by Article 11 (art. 11). The Delegate stressed that the proper construction of the relevant extract of the travaux préparatoires was that it fell to the Convention institutions to determine whether such a negative right existed under this Article (art. 11) and, if so, its scope.', '35. As to the question of the general scope of the right in issue, the Court notes, in the first place, that although the aforementioned judgment took account of the travaux préparatoires, it did not attach decisive importance to them; rather it used them as a working hypothesis (see, for example, pp. 21-22, paras. 52 and 55: ""Assuming for the sake of argument ..."" and ""Assuming that Article 11 (art. 11) does not guarantee the negative aspect of that freedom on the same footing as the positive aspect ...""). Moreover, whereas the membership obligation concerning Mr Young, Mr James and Mr Webster was based on an agreement between their employer and the trade unions, that of Mr Sigurdur A. Sigurjónsson was imposed by law. Under Articles 5 and 8 of the 1989 Law and Article 8 of the 1989 Regulation, he had to be a member of a specified association - Frami - in order to satisfy the licence conditions and it was not possible for him to join or form another association for that purpose. It was further provided that a failure to meet this condition could entail revocation of the licence and liability to pay a fine. Compulsory membership of this nature, which, it may be recalled, concerned a private-law association, does not exist under the laws of the great majority of the Contracting States. On the contrary, a large number of domestic systems contain safeguards which, in one way or another, guarantee the negative aspect of the freedom of association, that is the freedom not to join or to withdraw from an association.', 'A growing measure of common ground has emerged in this area also at the international level. As observed by the Commission, in addition to the above-mentioned Article 20 para. 2 of the Universal Declaration (see paragraph 33 above), Article 11 para. 2 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, adopted by the Heads of State or Government of eleven member States of the European Communities on 9 December 1989, provides that every employer and every worker shall have the freedom to join or not to join professional organisations or trade unions without any personal or occupational damage being thereby suffered by them. Moreover, on 24 September 1991 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe unanimously adopted a recommendation, amongst other things, to insert a sentence to this effect into Article 5 of the 1961 European Social Charter (see Parliamentary Assembly, Forty-third Ordinary Session (second part), 18-25 September 1991: Official Report of Debates, Vol. II, p. 502, and Texts adopted by the Assembly, Appendix to Recommendation 1168 (1991), p. 5). Even in the absence of an express provision, the Committee of Independent Experts set up to supervise the implementation of the Charter considers that a negative right is covered by this instrument and it has in several instances disapproved of closed-shop practices found in certain States Parties, including Iceland. With regard to the latter, the committee took account of, inter alia, the facts of the present case (see Conclusions XII-1, 1988-89, pp. 112-113, of the aforementioned committee). Following this, the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter issued a warning to Iceland (by ten votes to four with two abstentions; see the Governmental Committee ’ s 12th report to the Committee of Ministers of 22 March 1993, paragraph 113).', 'Furthermore, according to the practice of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office (ILO), union security measures imposed by law, notably by making union membership compulsory, would be incompatible with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 (the first concerning freedom of association and the right to organise and the second the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively; see Digest of decisions and principles of the said committee, 1985, paragraph 248).', 'In this connection, it should be recalled that the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see, amongst other authorities, the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 40, para. 102). Accordingly, Article 11 (art. 11) must be viewed as encompassing a negative right of association. It is not necessary for the Court to determine in this instance whether this right is to be considered on an equal footing with the positive right.', '36. As to the specific circumstances of the case, the Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that an obligation to join Frami already existed when the applicant obtained his licence in 1984. No significant weight can be attached to the fact that, before being granted the licence, he agreed to become a member; it is a matter of speculation whether he would have done so in the absence of the membership condition laid down in the 1983 Regulation (see paragraph 8 above), which was later held by the Supreme Court to lack a statutory basis (see paragraph 15 above), though his conduct since August 1985 suggests that he would not (see paragraphs 9 to 17 above). Nor has it been established that an obligation of membership arose for any other reason. In fact, only when the 1989 Law entered into force on 1 July 1989 did it become clear that membership was a requirement. The applicant has since been compelled to remain a member of Frami and would otherwise, as was amply illustrated by the revocation of his licence in 1986 (see paragraph 10 above), run the risk of losing his licence again. Such a form of compulsion, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the right guaranteed by Article 11 (art. 11) and itself amounts to an interference with that right (see the above-mentioned Young, James and Webster judgment, pp. 22-23, paras. 55 and 57, and the Sibson v. the United Kingdom judgment of 20 April 1993, Series A no. 258-A, p. 14, para. 29).', '37. What is more, Mr Sigurdur A. Sigurjónsson objected to being a member of the association in question partly because he disagreed with its policy in favour of limiting the number of taxicabs and, thus, access to the occupation; in his opinion the interests of his country were better served by extensive personal freedoms, including freedom of occupation, than State regulation. Therefore, the Court is of the view that Article 11 (art. 11) can, in the circumstances, be considered in the light of Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10), the protection of personal opinion being also one of the purposes of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 (art. 11) (see the above-mentioned Young, James and Webster judgment, pp. 23-24, para. 57). The pressure exerted on the applicant in order to compel him to remain a member of Frami contrary to his wishes was a further aspect going to the very essence of an Article 11 (art. 11) right; there was an interference too in this respect. The Government ’ s argument that Frami was a non-political association is not relevant in this regard.', '3. Recapitulation', '38. In the light of the above, the Court agrees with the applicant and the Commission that the measures complained of constituted interference with his right to freedom of association as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 11 (art. 11-1).', 'Such interference entails a violation of Article 11 (art. 11) unless it meets the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 (art. 11-2).', 'B. Whether the interference was justified under paragraph 2 of Article 11 (art. 11-2)', '39. The applicant ’ s complaint to the Strasbourg institutions concerned only the period after 1 July 1989, when the 1989 legislation entered into force (see paragraph 18 above). It is not contested that, after that date, the impugned membership obligation was ""prescribed by law"" and pursued a legitimate aim, namely as found by the Commission, the protection of the ""rights and freedoms of others"". The Court sees no reason to disagree.', '40. On the other hand, the applicant and the Commission disputed the Government ’ s view that the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"".', 'The Government, referring to their arguments set out in paragraphs 30 and 33 above, maintained in particular that, bearing in mind the status of the licence-holders as independent business operators, membership constituted a crucial link between them and Frami in that the latter would not be able to ensure the kind of supervisory functions which it performed unless all the licence-holders within its area were members. It would not be desirable to confer such tasks on taxi stations as these were in many instances owned by the licence-holders themselves and thus lacked the necessary authority; doing so would not only require legislative measures, but would also radically alter the relationship between the stations and the licence-holders. Nor would it be appropriate for the functions to be assumed by a public authority, as having them carried out by Frami was more expedient and less expensive.', '41. In the first place, the Court recalls that the impugned membership obligation was one imposed by law, the breach of which was likely to bring about the revocation of the applicant ’ s licence. He was thus subjected to a form of compulsion which, as already stated, is rare within the community of Contracting States and which, on the face of it, must be considered incompatible with Article 11 (art. 11) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 27, para. 65).', 'The Court does not doubt that Frami had a role that served not only the occupational interests of its members but also the public interest, and that its performance of the supervisory functions in question must have been facilitated by the obligation of every licence-holder within the association ’ s area to be a member. However, the Court is not convinced that compulsory membership of Frami was required in order to perform those functions. Firstly, the main responsibility for the supervision of the implementation of the relevant rules lay with the Committee (see paragraph 20 above). Secondly, membership was by no means the only conceivable way of compelling the licence- holders to carry out such duties and responsibilities as might be necessary for the relevant functions; for instance, some of those provided for in the applicable legislation (see paragraph 22 above) could be effectively enforced without the necessity of membership. Lastly, it has not been established that there was any other reason that would have prevented Frami from protecting its members ’ occupational interests in the absence of the compulsory membership imposed on the applicant despite his opinions (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Schmidt and Dahlström judgment, p. 16, para. 36, and the above-mentioned Young, James and Webster judgment, pp. 25-26, para. 64).', 'Having regard to the foregoing, the reasons adduced by the Government, although they can be considered relevant, are not sufficient to show that it was ""necessary"" to compel the applicant to be a member of Frami, on pain of losing his licence and contrary to his own opinions. In particular, notwithstanding Iceland ’ s margin of appreciation, the measures complained of were disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Consequently, there has been a violation of Article 11 (art. 11).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 9 AND 10 (art. 9, art. 10)', '42. The applicant shared the Commission ’ s opinion that if a violation were found of Article 11 (art. 11), it would be unnecessary to consider separately whether there have also been breaches of Articles 9 or 10 (art. 9, art. 10).', '43. Having taken account of these Articles (art. 9, art. 10) in the context of Article 11 (art. 11) (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above), the Court agrees with this view.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13)', '44. Before the Commission, the applicant, without invoking other arguments than those with respect to Article 11 (art. 11), alleged a violation of Article 13 (art. 13). However, in his submissions to the Court he stated that he accepted the Commission ’ s conclusion that there has been no violation of this Article (art. 13).', '45. The Court does not find it necessary to examine the matter of its own motion.', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '46. Mr Sigurdur A. Sigurjónsson sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50), according to which:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'The applicant did not seek compensation for damage but claimed reimbursement of costs and expenses, totalling 3,128,626 Icelandic crowns, in respect of the following items:', '(a) 78,941 crowns to cover translations of pleadings made and documents submitted in the proceedings before the Commission and Court;', '(b) 55,460 crowns for expenses relating to his lawyer ’ s journey to Strasbourg to appear before the Court;', '(c) 2,994,225 crowns for 370 hours ’ work (at 6,500 crowns per hour, plus 24.5% Value Added Tax) by the lawyer in respect of the Strasbourg proceedings.', '47. The Government made no objection to items (a) and (b) and agreed to pay item (c) at a reasonable amount if a violation were to be found.', '48. The Court is satisfied that items (a) and (b) were necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum; these should be reimbursed in their entirety, less the corresponding sum already paid by the Council of Europe by way of legal aid, namely 7,813 French francs.', 'As regards item (c), the Court, making an assessment on an equitable basis, considers that the applicant should be awarded under this head 2,000,000 Icelandic crowns, from which must be deducted the 7,050 French francs received from the Council of Europe in respect of legal fees.']",3,is,001-57844,0

Mr Otmar Chorherr is an Austrian citizen and currently resides in Vienna.', '7. On 26 October 1985 a military ceremony was held in the Rathausplatz in Vienna to mark the thirtieth anniversary of Austrian neutrality and the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. It started at 11 a.m. with the taking of the oath by some 1,200 conscripts and continued with a march past which ended at around 1 p.m. It was attended by about 50,000 people, in addition to numerous dignitaries on the official platform.', 'During the ceremony the applicant and a friend distributed leaflets calling for a referendum on the purchase of fighter aircraft by the Austrian armed forces ("" Volksbegehren für eine Volksabstimmung gegen Abfangjäger ""). They wore rucksacks to the backs of which were attached enlargements of the leaflet; these measured about 50cm by 70cm, projected approximately 50cm above the heads of the persons carrying them and bore the slogan"" Austria does not need any interceptor fighter planes"" ("" Österreich braucht keine Abfangjäger "").', '8. According to the judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ) on 28 November 1986 on the basis of the police file and the statements of the parties (see paragraph 10 below), what happened subsequently can be summarised as follows.', 'The actions of the two men had caused a commotion among the spectators, whose view had been blocked. Two policemen informed the applicant and his friend that they were disturbing public order and instructed them to cease what could only be regarded as a demonstration. However, they refused to comply, asserting their right to freedom of expression. When they persisted despite further warnings from police officers and increasingly loud protests from the crowd, they were arrested ( festgenommen ) at 11.15 a.m. and were taken to Central Vienna police station ( Bezirkspolizeikommissariat Innere Stadt ), where administrative criminal proceedings ( Verwaltungsstrafverfahren ) were instituted against them.', '9. At the police station the applicant was placed in police custody (in den Arrest abgegeben ) at 11.35. After ascertaining whether he had a criminal record, a police officer questioned him from 2.15 p.m. Mr Chorherr denied that he had been warned that he was committing administrative offences ( Verwaltungsübertretungen ); he would otherwise, so he said, have immediately ceased his action. He was released at 2.40 p.m.', '10. On 4 April 1986 he filed an appeal ( Beschwerde ) in the Constitutional Court against his arrest and the prohibition on distributing leaflets. He relied inter alia on Articles 5 and 10 (art. 5, art. 10) of the Convention and asserted his right to personal freedom ( Recht auf persönliche Freiheit ) and freedom of expression ( Freiheit der Meinungsäußerung ).', 'Mr Chorherr claimed that he had not disturbed the crowd in any way and had never been ordered by the police to cease demonstrating. The Constitutional Court did not, however, give credence to his statements, as in its opinion the majority of the spectators had come to watch the parade and some of them had had their enjoyment of it marred by the applicant ’ s conduct.', 'The appeal was dismissed on 28 November 1986. The Constitutional Court found, in relation to the applicant ’ s arrest, that Mr Chorherr ’ s conduct could properly have been considered an administrative offence and that the applicant, caught in the act of committing the offence, had continued despite the instructions of the police officers. It took the view that the requirements of Article 4 of the Law on the Protection of Personal Freedom ( Gesetz zum Schutz der persönlichen Freiheit ), section 35, sub-paragraph 3, of the Law on Administrative Offences ( Verwaltungsstrafgesetz ) of 1950 and section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Introductory Law of the Administrative Procedure Laws ( Einführungsgesetz zu den Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetzen - ""the Introductory Law"") had therefore all been complied with in this respect (see paragraph 12 below).', 'As to the custody ( Anhaltung ), the Constitutional Court held that this had been in conformity with section 36 (1), first sentence, of the Law on Administrative Offences, since there had been no particular circumstance to make the police think that the applicant, if released, would not recommence his culpable actions.', 'Finally, the court considered that the order to remove the placards and cease distributing leaflets had not in any way infringed the constitutional right to freedom of opinion, as its aim was not to prevent the applicant exercising such freedom, but rather to put an end to a breach of the peace.', '11. At the conclusion of the administrative criminal proceedings the Federal Police Authority ( Bundespolizeidirektion ) in Vienna made a sentence order ( Straferkenntnis ) on 29 April 1987, fining Mr Chorherr 1,000 schillings for causing excessive noise and a breach of the peace (section VIII, second limb, and section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Introductory Law - see paragraph 12 below). On appeal by the applicant, the Public Security Authority ( Sicherheitsdirektion ) on 3 March 1988, while amending the wording of the decision, upheld the conviction on the latter charge and reduced the fine to 700 schillings; on 25 April 1988 it withdrew the charge of causing excessive noise. The applicant did not appeal to the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court.', 'III. THE AUSTRIAN RESERVATION TO ARTICLE 5 (ART. 5) OF THE CONVENTION', '13. The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, the following reservation:', '""The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.""']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', '12. The administrative procedure legislation, reissued on 23 May 1950 by a decision of the Federal Government ( Kundmachung der Bundesregierung vom 23. Mai 1950 über die Wiederverlautbarung von Rechtsvorschriften auf dem Gebiet des Verwaltungsstrafverfahrens ), includes the following provisions.', 'Introductory Law of the Administrative Procedure Laws', 'Section VIII, second limb [*]', '""A person who ... offends public decency or causes excessive noise commits an administrative offence ...""', 'Section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1', '""A person who ... causes a breach of the peace by conduct likely to cause annoyance ... commits ... an administrative offence ...""', 'Law on Administrative Offences', 'Arrest ( Festnahme )', 'Section 35', '""The agents of the security forces may, except in the cases specially regulated by law, arrest persons caught in the act of committing an offence, for the purpose of bringing them before the authorities, if', '...', '(3) despite being warned, the person in question persists in the culpable conduct or attempts to repeat it.""', 'Section 36(1)', '""Every arrested person must immediately be brought before the nearest competent authority, or released if the reason for the arrest has already ceased to exist ...""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '14. Mr Chorherr applied to the Commission on 14 July 1987. He complained of a violation of Articles 5 and 10 (art. 5, art. 10) of the Convention.', 'On 1 March 1991 the Commission declared the complaint relating to the sentence order (see paragraph 11 above) inadmissible on the ground of failure to exhaust domestic remedies (Article 26 of the Convention) (art. 26), and declared the remainder of the application (no. 13308/87) admissible. In its report of 21 May 1992 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no breach of Article 5 (art. 5) (twelve votes to two), but that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (seven votes to seven, with the acting President ’ s casting vote). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 (art. 5)', '15. The applicant alleged that his arrest and his detention by the police had infringed Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention, which reads as follows:', '""Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:', '...', '(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;', '...""', 'According to the Government, the contested measures were founded on laws covered by the Austrian reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) (see paragraph 13 above).', 'In Mr Chorherr ’ s submission, on the other hand, his conduct was in no way ""likely to cause annoyance"" and consequently was not caught either by section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Introductory Law (see paragraph 12 above) or by any other of the provisions covered by the reservation, which was therefore not applicable.', 'However, the Constitutional Court found that the deprivation of liberty was based on section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, and that all the relevant requirements had been complied with (see paragraph 10 above).', '16. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the above-mentioned reservation satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention. Only two of them need be examined here: the prohibition of reservations ""of a general character"" and the requirement that the reservation should contain ""a brief statement of the law concerned"". The other conditions are manifestly fulfilled and compliance therewith was not moreover in dispute before the Court.', 'A. The ""general character"" of the Austrian reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5)', '17. In the applicant ’ s view the field of application of section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Introductory Law is so vast that it cannot be regarded as a ""law"" within the meaning of Article 64 para. 1 (art. 64-1) of the Convention. As the Austrian reservation embraced the aforementioned section of the Introductory Law, it was of ""a general character"" and thus prohibited under the Convention provision.', 'In the Government ’ s contention, the section in question is aimed at a very specific offence, the limits of which have been even more precisely defined by a substantial body of case-law from the Administrative Court.', '18. The Court reiterates that ""by ‘ reservation of a general character ’ in Article 64 (art. 64) is meant in particular a reservation couched in terms that are too vague or broad for it to be possible to determine their exact meaning and scope"" (see the Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 26, para. 55). It shares the Commission ’ s view that the Austrian reservation encompasses a limited number of laws which, taken together, constitute a well-defined and coherent body of substantive and procedural administrative provisions. Among other things, they lay down rules for the punishment of offences, setting out the punishable acts, the penalties incurred and the procedure to be followed.', 'It should be added that the provisions to which the reservation applied in this case were all in force on 3 September 1958, when Austria ratified the Convention (see paragraph 13 above), namely sections VIII and IX(1) of the Introductory Law and sections 35 and 36 (1) of the Law on Administrative Offences (see paragraph 12 above and also, mutatis mutandis, the Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1982, Series A no. 48, p. 17, para. 37).', 'It follows that the wording of the reservation in question does not attain, in relation to the provisions in issue here, the degree of generality prohibited by Article 64 para. 1 (art. 64-1) of the Convention.', 'B. The need for a ""brief statement of the law concerned""', '19. Mr Chorherr and a minority of the Commission stressed that, by way of ""brief statement"", the reservation confined itself to a mere reference to the Federal Official Gazette ( Bundesgesetzblatt ). They considered that it was not possible by reading the text in question to obtain a precise idea of the content of the laws concerned, especially in view of the fact that there were four of them and they were long. Paragraph 2 of Article 64 (art. 64-2) had therefore not been complied with.', '20. According to the Court ’ s case-law, the ""brief statement"" as required by that provision ""both constitutes an evidential factor and contributes to legal certainty""; its purpose ""is to provide a guarantee - in particular for the other Contracting Parties and the Convention institutions - that a reservation does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded by the State concerned"" (see the Belilos judgment, cited above, Series A no. 132, pp. 27-28, para. 59, and the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 19, para. 38). This does not, however, mean that it is necessary under Article 64 para. 2 (art. 64-2) to provide a description, even a concise one, of the substance of the texts in question.', 'In this instance, the reference to the Federal Official Gazette - preceded moreover by an indication of the subject-matter of the relevant provisions - makes it possible for everyone to identify the precise laws concerned and to obtain any information regarding them. It also provides a safeguard against any interpretation which would unduly extend the field of application of the reservation. Accordingly, that reservation complies with Article 64 para. 2 (art. 64-2).', 'Conclusion', '21. As the reservation is therefore compatible with Article 64 (art. 64), the Court finds that there has been no violation of Article 5 (art. 5).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '22. In complaining of the deprivation of liberty inflicted on him, the applicant also relied on Article 10 (art. 10), which reads as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '23. None of the participants in the proceedings disputed that the measure in question constituted an interference with the exercise of Mr Chorherr ’ s right to freedom of expression. Such intervention is in breach of Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" to attain them.', 'A. Whether the interference was ""prescribed by law""', '24. In Mr Chorherr ’ s submission, section IX(1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Introductory Law could not be regarded as a ""law"" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) of the Convention. Its wording was, he argued, too general and made it impossible ""to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail"" (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, para. 49).', '25. The Court reiterates that the level of precision required of the domestic legislation - which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality - depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument considered, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, inter alia, the following judgments: Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 33, para. 88; Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland, 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 26, para. 68; and Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, Series A no. 244, p. 27, para. 89). Furthermore it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 252, p. 18, para. 42). In the present case there is nothing in the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment to lend weight to the proposition that the wording of the contested provision creates a situation incompatible with legal certainty (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). Mr Chorherr was therefore in a position to foresee to a reasonable extent the risks inherent in his conduct. Accordingly, the Court considers, like the Government and the Commission, that the interference was ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Whether the aim pursued was legitimate', '26. The applicant maintained that the sole purpose of the impugned measures was to prevent him from expressing in public an opinion hostile to the army; these measures could not therefore find support in paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', '27. The Government replied that the police intervention was intended to prevent disorder and to protect the rights of citizens to attend a military parade without being molested. They invoked, inter alia, the positive duties that Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention entailed for the State (see the Plattform"" Ärzte für das Leben"" v. Austria judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, para. 32).', '28. Having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the actions of the applicant and the police, the Court, like the Commission, sees no grounds for doubting that the arrest in issue pursued at least one of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), namely the prevention of disorder.', 'C. Whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society""', '29. Mr Chorherr denied that the interference in question had been necessary. If the poster projecting above his rucksack had genuinely blocked the view of a number of spectators, it would have been sufficient for the police to ask him to remove it. In reality, however, it could not have caused a substantial nuisance because at the same time he had been moving among the crowd handing out leaflets, which again was not in itself conduct liable to create such a serious disturbance as to justify his arrest. In any event, if the police officers had clearly ordered him to cease his demonstration - which they did not - he would have complied with that instruction.', 'The majority of the Commission drew attention to the fact that the applicant had not been released until one and a half hours after the end of the ceremony and expressed the opinion that the interference complained of was disproportionate.', '30. In the Government ’ s contention, the police had had to intervene because of the commotion that the applicant ’ s behaviour was beginning to engender among the spectators who wished to attend the parade peaceably. Some of them had even threatened the applicant, who had moreover, despite his claims to the contrary, refused to obey the instructions of the police officers. It was therefore to be feared, if the police merely moved him further away, that he would continue his action elsewhere and that it would get out of hand. The length of the police custody was explained by the fact that at the same time thirteen other persons who had been arrested were being detained at the police station for questioning.', '31. The Court has consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference is necessary, but this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it; when carrying out that supervision the Court must ascertain whether the impugned measures are ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"", due regard being had to the importance of freedom of expression in a democratic society (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Barfod v. Denmark, 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, para. 28; Groppera Radio AG and Others, cited above, Series A no. 173, p. 28, para. 72; and Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 59).', 'That margin of appreciation extends in particular to the choice of the - reasonable and appropriate - means to be used by the authorities to ensure that lawful manifestations can take place peacefully (see, mutatis mutandis, the Plattform"" Ärzte für das Leben"" judgment, cited above, Series A no. 139, p. 12, para. 34).', '32. The Court notes in the first place that the nature, importance and scale of the parade could appear to the police to justify strengthening the forces deployed to ensure that it passed off peacefully. In addition, when he chose this event for his demonstration against the Austrian armed forces, Mr Chorherr must have realised that it might lead to a disturbance requiring measures of restraint, which in this instance, moreover, were not excessive. Finally, when the Constitutional Court approved these measures it expressly found that in the circumstances of the case they had been intended to prevent breaches of the peace and not to frustrate the expression of an opinion (see paragraph 10 above).', '33. In the light of these findings, it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped the margin of appreciation which they enjoyed in order to determine whether the measures in issue were ""necessary in a democratic society"" and in particular whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim pursued.', 'In conclusion, no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) has been established.']",3,at,001-57821,0

The first applicant, an association of co-proprietors and residents of a housing development in Linz, comprising 458 apartments and 30 businesses, proposed to improve the communication between its members by setting up an internal cable television network. The programmes were to be confined to questions of mutual interest concerning members ’ rights.', '9. On 9 June 1978 the first applicant applied for an operating licence under the Telecommunications Law ( Fernmeldegesetz, see paragraph 17 below). As the Linz Regional Post and Telecommunications Head Office (Post- und Telegraphendirektion ) had not replied within the six-month time-limit laid down in Article 73 of the Code of Administrative Procedure ( Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz ), the association applied to the National Head Office ( Generaldirektion für die Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung ), attached to the Federal Ministry of Transport ( Bundesministerium für Verkehr ).', 'The National Head Office rejected the application on 23 November 1979. In its view, Article 1 para. 2 of the Constitutional Law guaranteeing the independence of broadcasting ( Bundesverfassungsgesetz über die Sicherung der Unabhängigkeit des Rundfunks, ""the Constitutional Broadcasting Law"", see paragraph 19 below) had vested in the federal legislature exclusive authority to regulate this activity; it had exercised that authority only once, by enacting the Law on the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ( Bundesgesetz über die Aufgaben und die Einrichtung des Österreichischen Rundfunks, see paragraph 20 below). It followed that no other person could apply for such licence as any application would lack a legal basis. Furthermore there had been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention since the legislature - in its capacity as a maker of constitutional laws ( Verfassungsgesetzgeber ) - had merely availed itself of its power to set up a system of licences in accordance with the third sentence of paragraph 1 (art. 10-1).', '10. Thereupon the first applicant complained to the Constitutional Court of a breach of Article 10 (art. 10); the court gave judgment on 16 December 1983.', 'It took the view that the freedom to set up and operate radio and television broadcasting stations was subject to the powers accorded to the legislature under paragraph 1 in fine and paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-1, art. 10-2) ( Gesetzesvorbehalt ). Accordingly, an administrative decision could infringe that provision only if it proved to have no legal basis, or its legal basis was unconstitutional or again had been applied in an arbitrary manner (in denkunmöglicher Weise an[ ge ] wendet ). In addition, the Constitutional Broadcasting Law had instituted a system which made all activity of this type subject to the grant of a licence ( Konzession ) by the federal legislature. This system was intended to ensure objectivity and diversity of opinions ( Meinungsvielfalt ), and would be ineffective if it were possible for everybody to obtain the requisite authorisation. As matters stood, the right to broadcast was restricted to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ( Österreichischer Rundfunk, ORF), as no implementing legislation had been enacted in addition to the law governing that organisation.', 'Contrary to its assertions, the first applicant had in fact intended to broadcast within the meaning of the constitutional law, because its programmes were to be directed at a general audience of variable composition. The broadcasting law therefore provided a legal basis for the decision in issue.', 'Consequently, the Constitutional Court rejected the complaint and remitted it to the Administrative Court.', '11. On 10 September 1986 the Administrative Court in substance adopted the grounds relied on by the Constitutional Court and in its turn dismissed the first applicant ’ s claim.', 'B. Jörg Haider', '12. From 1987 to 1989 the second applicant elaborated a project for the setting up, with other persons, of a private radio station in Carinthia. He subsequently gave up the idea after a study had shown him that according to the applicable law as interpreted by the Constitutional Court he would not be able to obtain the necessary licence. As a result he never applied for one.', 'C. Arbeitsgemeinschaft Offenes Radio (AGORA)', '13. The third applicant, an Austrian association and a member of the Fédération européenne des radios libres (FERL - European Federation of Free Radios), plans to establish a radio station in southern Carinthia in order to broadcast, in German and Slovene, non-commercial radio programmes, whose makers already operate an authorised mobile radio station in Italy.', '14. In 1988 AGORA applied for a licence. Its application was refused by the Klagenfurt Regional Post and Telecommunications Head Office on 19 December 1989 and by the National Head Office in Vienna on 9 August 1990. On 30 September 1991, on the basis of its own case-law (see paragraph 10 above), the Constitutional Court dismissed an appeal from that decision.', 'D. Wilhelm Weber', '15. The fourth applicant is a shareholder of an Italian company operating a commercial radio which broadcasts to Austria and he wishes to carry out the same activity in that country. However, in view of the legislation in force, he decided not to make any application to the appropriate authorities.', 'E. Radio Melody GmbH', '16. The fifth applicant is a private limited company incorporated under Austrian law. On 8 November 1988 it asked the Linz Regional Post and Telecommunications Head Office to allocate it a frequency so that it could operate a local radio station which it hoped to launch in Salzburg. On 28 April 1989 its application was rejected, a decision confirmed on 12 July 1989 by the National Head Office and on 18 June 1990 by the Constitutional Court, which based its decision on its judgment of 16 December 1983 (see paragraph 10 above).']","['II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The Telecommunications Law of 13 July 1949 ("" Fernmeldegesetz "")', '17. According to the Telecommunications Law of 13 July 1949, ""the right to set up and operate telecommunications installations ( Fernmeldeanlagen ) is vested exclusively in the federal authorities (Bund)"" (Article 2 para. 1). The latter may however confer on natural or legal persons the power to exercise that right in respect of specific installations (Article 3 para. 1). No licence is required in certain circumstances, including the setting up of an installation within the confines of a private property (Article 5).', 'B. The Ministerial Ordinance of 18 September 1961 concerning private telecommunications installations ("" Verordnung des Bundesministeriums für Verkehr und Elektrizitätswirtschaft über Privatfernmeldeanlagen "")', '18. The Ministerial Ordinance of 18 September 1961 concerning private telecommunications installations lays down inter alia the conditions for setting up and operating private telecommunications installations subject to federal supervision. According to the case-law, it cannot however constitute the legal basis for the grant of licences.', 'C. The Constitutional Law of 10 July 1974 guaranteeing the independence of broadcasting ("" Bundesverfassungsgesetz über die Sicherung der Unabhängigkeit des Rundfunks "")', '19.

Broadcasting within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be a public service.""', 'D. The Law of 10 July 1974 on the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ("" Bundesgesetz über die Aufgaben und die Einrichtung des Österreichischen Rundfunks "")', '20. The Law of 10 July 1974 on the National Broadcasting Corporation established the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation with the status of an autonomous public-law corporation.', 'It is under a duty to provide comprehensive news coverage of major political, economic, cultural and sporting events; to this end, it has to broadcast, in compliance with the requirements of objectivity and diversity of views, in particular current affairs, news reports, commentaries and critical opinions (Article 2 para. 1 (1)), and to do so via at least two television channels and three radio stations, one of which must be a regional station (Article 3). Broadcasting time must be allocated to the political parties represented in the national parliament and to representative associations (Article 5 para. 1).', 'A supervisory board ( Kommission zur Wahrung des Rundfunkgesetzes ) rules on all disputes concerning the application of the above-mentioned law which fall outside the jurisdiction of an administrative authority or court (Articles 25 and 27). It is composed of seventeen independent members, including nine judges, appointed for terms of four years by the President of the Republic on the proposal of the Federal Government.', 'E. The case-law concerning ""passive"" cable broadcasting', '21. On 8 July 1992 the Administrative Court decided that the Constitutional Law of 10 July 1974 (see paragraph 19 above) did not cover ""passive"" broadcasting via cable, in other words the broadcasting in their entirety by cable of programmes picked up by an aerial. Consequently, the mere fact that such programmes originated from a foreign station and were directed principally or exclusively at an Austrian audience could not constitute grounds for refusing the licence necessary for this type of operation.', 'F. Subsequent developments', '22. On 1 January 1994 a Law on regional radio stations is to enter into force ( Regionalradiogesetz, Official Gazette ( Bundesgesetzblatt ) no. 1993/506). It will allow the authorities under certain conditions to grant private individuals or private corporations licences to set up and operate regional radio stations.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '23. The applicants lodged applications with the Commission on various dates between 16 April 1987 and 20 August 1990 (applications nos. 13914/88, 15041/89, 15717/89, 15779/89 and 17207/90). They maintained that the impossibility of obtaining an operating licence was an unjustified interference with their right to communicate information and infringed Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. The first and third applicants also complained of a discrimination contrary to Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10). The fifth applicant alleged in addition a breach of Article 6 (art. 6), inasmuch as it had not been able to bring the dispute before a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of that provision.', '24. The Commission ordered the joinder of the applications on 13 July 1990 and 14 January 1992. On 15 January 1992 it found the complaints concerning Articles 10 and 14 (art. 10, art. 14) admissible, declaring that relating to Article 6 (art. 6) inadmissible. In its report of 9 September 1992 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the following opinion:', '(a) that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (unanimously as regards the first applicant and by fourteen votes to one for the others);', '(b) that it was not necessary also to examine the case from the point of view of Article 14 (art. 14) (unanimously as regards the first applicant and by fourteen votes to one for the third applicant).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'THE GOVERNMENT ’ S FINAL SUBMISSIONS', '25. The Government asked the Court ""to find that there had been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10), either taken on its own or in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+10)"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '26. The applicants complained that they had each been unable to set up a radio station or, in the case of Informationsverein Lentia, a television station, as under Austrian legislation this right was restricted to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. They asserted that this constituted a monopoly incompatible with Article 10 (art. 10), which provides as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'The Government contested this claim, whereas the Commission in substance accepted it.', '27. The Court observes that the restrictions in issue amount to an ""interference"" with the exercise by the applicants of their freedom to impart information and ideas; indeed this was common ground between the participants in the proceedings. The only question which arises is therefore whether such interference was justified.', 'In this connection the fact that Mr Haider and Mr Weber never applied for a broadcasting licence (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above) is of no consequence; before the Commission the Government accepted that those two applicants could be regarded as victims and the Government did not argue to the contrary before the Court.', '28. In the Government ’ s contention, sufficient basis for the contested interference is to be found in paragraph 1 in fine, which, in their view, has to be interpreted autonomously. In the alternative, they argued that it also satisfied the conditions laid down in paragraph 2.', '29. The Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the third sentence of Article 10 para. 1 (art. 10-1) and the scope of its application must be considered in the context of the Article as a whole and in particular in relation to the requirements of paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), to which licensing measures remain subject (see the Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 24, para. 61, and the Autronic AG v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 178, p. 24, para. 52). It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether the rules in question complied with both of these provisions.', 'A. Paragraph 1, third sentence (art. 10-1)', '30. In the Government ’ s view, the licensing system referred to at the end of paragraph 1 allows States not only to regulate the technical aspects of audio-visual activities, but also to determine their place and role in modern society. They argued that this was clear from the wording of the third sentence of paragraph 1 (art. 10-1), which was less restrictive than that of paragraph 2 and of Article 11 (art. 11-2) and thus allowed more extensive interference by the public authorities with the freedom in question. By the same token, it left the States a wider margin of appreciation in defining their media policy and its implementation. This could even take the form of a public broadcasting service monopoly in particular in cases where, as in Austria, that was the State ’ s sole means of guaranteeing the objectivity and impartiality of news, the balanced reporting of all shades of opinion and the independence of the persons and bodies responsible for the programmes.', '31. According to the applicants, the rules in force in Austria, and in particular the monopoly of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, essentially reflect the authorities ’ wish to secure political control of the audio-visual industry, to the detriment of pluralism and artistic freedom. By eliminating all competition, the rules served in addition to protect the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ’ s economic viability at the cost of a serious encroachment on the freedom to conduct business. In short, they did not comply with the third sentence of paragraph 1.', '32. As the Court has already held, the purpose of that provision is to make it clear that States are permitted to regulate by a licensing system the way in which broadcasting is organised in their territories, particularly in its technical aspects (see the above-mentioned Groppera Radio AG and Others judgment, Series A no. 173, p. 24, para. 61). Technical aspects are undeniably important, but the grant or refusal of a licence may also be made conditional on other considerations, including such matters as the nature and objectives of a proposed station, its potential audience at national, regional or local level, the rights and needs of a specific audience and the obligations deriving from international legal instruments.', 'This may lead to interferences whose aims will be legitimate under the third sentence of paragraph 1, even though they do not correspond to any of the aims set out in paragraph 2. The compatibility of such interferences with the Convention must nevertheless be assessed in the light of the other requirements of paragraph 2.', '33. The monopoly system operated in Austria is capable of contributing to the quality and balance of programmes, through the supervisory powers over the media thereby conferred on the authorities. In the circumstances of the present case it is therefore consistent with the third sentence of paragraph 1. It remains, however, to be determined whether it also satisfies the relevant conditions of paragraph 2.', 'B. Paragraph 2 (art. 10-2)', '34. The interferences complained of were, and this is not disputed by any of the participants in the proceedings, ""prescribed by law"". Their aim has already been held by the Court to be a legitimate one (see paragraphs 32-33 above). On the other hand, a problem arises in connection with the question whether the interferences were ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '35. The Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing the need for an interference, but this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, whose extent will vary according to the circumstances. In cases such as the present one, where there has been an interference with the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1), the supervision must be strict because of the importance - frequently stressed by the Court - of the rights in question. The necessity for any restriction must be convincingly established (see, among other authorities, the Autronic AG judgment, cited above, Series A no. 178, pp. 26-27, para. 61).', '36. The Government drew attention in the first place to the political dimension of the activities of the audio-visual media, which is reflected in Austria in the aims fixed for such media under Article 1 para. 2 of the Constitutional Broadcasting Law, namely to guarantee the objectivity and impartiality of reporting, the diversity of opinions, balanced programming and the independence of persons and bodies responsible for programmes (see paragraph 20 above). In the Government ’ s view, only the system in force, based on the monopoly of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, made it possible for the authorities to ensure compliance with these requirements. That was why the applicable legislation and the charter of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation made provision for the independence of programming, the freedom of journalists and the balanced representation of political parties and social groups in the managing bodies.', 'In opting to keep the present system, the State had in any case merely acted within its margin of appreciation, which had remained unchanged since the adoption of the Convention; very few of the Contracting States had had different systems at the time. In view of the diversity of the structures which now exist in this field, it could not seriously be maintained that a genuine European model had come into being in the meantime.', '37. The applicants maintained that to protect public opinion from manipulation it was by no means necessary to have a public monopoly in the audio-visual industry, otherwise it would be equally necessary to have one for the press. On the contrary, true progress towards attaining diversity of opinion and objectivity was to be achieved only by providing a variety of stations and programmes. In reality, the Austrian authorities were essentially seeking to retain their political control over broadcasting.', '38. The Court has frequently stressed the fundamental role of freedom of expression in a democratic society, in particular where, through the press, it serves to impart information and ideas of general interest, which the public is moreover entitled to receive (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59). Such an undertaking cannot be successfully accomplished unless it is grounded in the principle of pluralism, of which the State is the ultimate guarantor. This observation is especially valid in relation to audio-visual media, whose programmes are often broadcast very widely.', '39. Of all the means of ensuring that these values are respected, a public monopoly is the one which imposes the greatest restrictions on the freedom of expression, namely the total impossibility of broadcasting otherwise than through a national station and, in some cases, to a very limited extent through a local cable station. The far-reaching character of such restrictions means that they can only be justified where they correspond to a pressing need.', 'As a result of the technical progress made over the last decades, justification for these restrictions can no longer today be found in considerations relating to the number of frequencies and channels available; the Government accepted this. Secondly, for the purposes of the present case they have lost much of their raison d ’ être in view of the multiplication of foreign programmes aimed at Austrian audiences and the decision of the Administrative Court to recognise the lawfulness of their retransmission by cable (see paragraph 21 above). Finally and above all, it cannot be argued that there are no equivalent less restrictive solutions; it is sufficient by way of example to cite the practice of certain countries which either issue licences subject to specified conditions of variable content or make provision for forms of private participation in the activities of the national corporation.', '40. The Government finally adduced an economic argument, namely that the Austrian market was too small to sustain a sufficient number of stations to avoid regroupings and the constitution of ""private monopolies"".', '41. In the applicant ’ s opinion, this is a pretext for a policy which, by eliminating all competition, seeks above all to guarantee to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation advertising revenue, at the expense of the principle of free enterprise.', '42. The Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument. Their assertions are contradicted by the experience of several European States, of a comparable size to Austria, in which the coexistence of private and public stations, according to rules which vary from country to country and accompanied by measures preventing the development of private monopolies, shows the fears expressed to be groundless.', '43. In short, like the Commission, the Court considers that the interferences in issue were disproportionate to the aim pursued and were, accordingly, not necessary in a democratic society. There has therefore been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10).', '44. In the circumstances of the case, this finding makes it unnecessary for the Court to determine whether, as was claimed by some of the applicants, there has also been a breach of Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) (see, inter alia, the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 16, para. 30).', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '45. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'The Court examined the applicants ’ claims in the light of the observations of the participants in the proceedings and the criteria laid down in its case-law.', 'A. Damage', '46. Only two applicants sought compensation for pecuniary damage:"" Informationsverein Lentia"" in the amount of 900,000 Austrian schillings and ""Radio Melody"" 5,444,714.66 schillings.', 'They based their claims on the assumption that they would not have failed to obtain the licences applied for if the Austrian legislation had been in conformity with Article 10 (art. 10). This is, however, speculation, in view of the discretion left in this field to the authorities, as the Delegate of the Commission correctly pointed out. No compensation is therefore recoverable under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '47. As regards costs and expenses, the applicants claimed respectively 136,023.54 schillings ("" Informationsverein Lentia ""), 513,871.20 schillings ( Haider ), 390,115.20 schillings (""AGORA""), 519,871.20 schillings (Weber) and 605,012.40 schillings (""Radio Melody"").', 'The Government took the view that the first of those amounts was reasonable and that it should, however, in their view, be increased to 165,000 schillings to take account of the proceedings before the Court.', 'Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards 165,000 schillings each to the applicants"" Informationsverein Lentia "", ""AGORA"" and ""Radio Melody"", for the proceedings conducted in Austria and in Strasbourg. Mr Haider and Mr Weber, who appeared only before the Convention institutions, are entitled to 100,000 schillings each.']",2,at,001-57854,1

Mr Pablo Casado Coca, a Spanish national, lives at Valldoreitx, near Barcelona, and practises as a lawyer ( abogado ) in Barcelona.', '7. After setting up his practice in 1979, he regularly placed notices advertising it in the ""miscellaneous advertisements"" pages of several Barcelona newspapers and the Revista alemana de España (""German Journal of Spain""). He also wrote to various companies offering his services.', '8. The Barcelona Bar Council (Junta de Govern del Col.legi d ’ Advocats ) brought disciplinary proceedings against him four times on this account, and in 1981 and 1982 these led to the imposition of penalties, namely two reprimands and two warnings. The applicant lodged internal appeals against these penalties but did not apply to the competent courts.', 'A. The Bar Council proceedings', '9. From October 1982 notices giving details of the applicant ’ s legal practice were published in the newsletter of the Valldoreitx Residents ’ and Property Owners ’ Association. They took up approximately one-third of a page and gave the applicant ’ s name, with the title ""lawyer"" ( letrado ), and his office address and telephone number.', '10. The Barcelona Bar Council brought further disciplinary proceedings against Mr Casado Coca on this account. On 6 April 1983 he again received a written warning for disregarding the ban on professional advertising (Article 31 of Royal Decree no. 2090/82 of 24 July 1982, laying down the Statute of the Bar - see paragraph 22 below).', '11. On 3 June 1983, following an internal appeal by the applicant, the National Bar Council ( Consejo general de la Abogacía ) upheld the penalty imposed. Referring to Article 31 of the Statute of the Bar as amplified in the relevant rules of the Barcelona Bar Council (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 below), it held that, given their nature, the notices in question went beyond the defined limits. It also pointed out that the applicant had recently incurred other disciplinary penalties for the same reason, and these had to be taken into consideration when ruling on the appeal.', 'B. Proceedings in the competent courts', '12. Mr Casado Coca then applied to the Barcelona Audiencia Territorial. He argued in particular that the purpose of his notice was to inform the public and that the warning infringed Article 20 of the Constitution, which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression. He also alleged that the principle that only a statute could define offences and lay down penalties had been contravened because the provisions which prohibited advertising by members of the Bar and attached disciplinary penalties were regulatory in nature.', 'The court dismissed his application on 11 May 1987, holding that the notice in question was a vehicle for advertising and not simply an announcement of information. It appeared beside similar announcements by a driving school and an old people ’ s home and went beyond the limits laid down in the Bar ’ s rules, which allowed notices only to announce the setting up of a practice or a change of address; this was not the applicant ’ s case.', '13. On 23 September 1988 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law by Mr Casado Coca and at the same time refused to refer the case to the Constitutional Court on grounds of unconstitutionality.', 'It rejected the ground of appeal based on disregard of the principle that only a statute could define offences and lay down penalties. It did so by reference to the case-law of the Constitutional Court, according to which Article 36 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 below) makes it permissible for statute law to provide that the rules governing professional associations and the practice of the professions may be laid down by means of regulations. It held that Article 20 did not protect advertising as a fundamental right, because advertising was not a matter of expressing thoughts, ideas or opinions but of announcing the existence of a profit-making business activity.', 'Moreover, the ban on professional advertising by members of the Bar had legitimate aims, namely to uphold free competition and to protect clients ’ interests. In such a case the right in question could be subject to restrictions.', 'C. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court', '14. The applicant then lodged an appeal ( recurso de amparo ) with the Constitutional Court. He again maintained that it was contrary to the principle of statutory definition of offences and prescription of penalties enshrined in the Constitution to lay down administrative penalties by means of a decree, and that since the notice set out genuine information, i.e. his name, address and telephone number, the penalty imposed contravened Article 20 of the Constitution.', '15. On 17 April 1989 the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible.', 'It held that the penalty complained of did not infringe the fundamental right to communicate genuine information. The aim of the advertising was connected with the ""carrying on of a commercial, industrial, craft or professional activity""; it consisted in ""directly or indirectly promoting the conclusion of contracts relating to movable or immovable property, services, rights or obligations"", whereas the purpose of the fundamental right defined in Article 20 para. 1 (d) was to enable citizens to ""form their beliefs by weighing different or even diametrically opposed opinions and thus taking part in the discussion of public affairs"". The ban on advertising professional services did not infringe the fundamental right in question.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. General provisions', '1. The 1978 Constitution', '16.

It is also forbidden for members of the Bar to consent either expressly or tacitly to any form of advertising offered to them.', '3.

On 4 July 1991 the Council of the Catalonia Bars ( Consell dels Col.legis d ’ Advocats de Catalunya ) adopted new rules on advertising. These superseded the earlier rules included in the statutes and decisions of the Catalonia Bars (Rule 6).', 'The preamble states:', '""Advertising by members of the Bar is traditionally considered to be more or less incompatible with professional ethics.

Mr Casado Coca applied to the Commission on 25 May 1989. He alleged several breaches of the Convention: (a) Article 7 (art. 7), in that the disciplinary rules of the Spanish Bars were laid down by decree and not by a Law; (b) Article 10 (art. 10), because the Barcelona Bar Council had given him a warning for publishing a notice in a local newsletter; (c) Article 4 para. 2 (art. 4-2), because members of the Spanish Bar could not choose to specialise; (d) Article 14 taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10), in that the members of other professions had more scope to advertise.', '30. On 2 December 1991 the Commission declared the application (no. 15450/89) admissible in respect of the complaint relating to Article 10 (art. 10) but inadmissible as to the remainder. In its report of 1 December 1992 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion by nine votes to nine, with the President ’ s casting vote, that there had been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'GOVERNMENT ’ S FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '31. In their memorial of 13 July 1993 the Government requested the Court to hold', '""1. that this case does not come within the scope of Article 10 (art. 10); and', '2. that if Article 10 (art. 10) does apply in this case, the Kingdom of Spain has not failed to fulfil its obligations under the Convention"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '32. Mr Casado Coca complained of the disciplinary sanction imposed on him by the Barcelona Bar Council on 6 April 1983 for having published a notice about his practice in several issues of a local newsletter. He relied on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'A. Applicability of Article 10 (art. 10)', '33. The Government disputed the applicability of Article 10 (art. 10). They contended that the applicant ’ s notices did not in any way constitute information of a commercial nature but were simply advertising. He had paid for them with the sole aim of securing more clients. Advertising as such did not come within the ambit of freedom of expression; an advertisement did not serve the public interest but the private interests of the individuals concerned. Applying the guarantees of Article 10 (art. 10) to advertising would be tantamount to altering the scope of that Article (art. 10).', '34. According to the applicant, the information given in his notices had indeed been intended for the general public; assuming it had succeeded in attracting an influx of clients, this would have been because the public had found it useful and necessary. Advertising was, moreover, a general concept comprising several categories according to the political or commercial content of the information or ideas in question. Furthermore, the protection of human rights did not necessarily have to further the public interest; it could serve private interests.', '35. The Court would first point out that Article 10 (art. 10) guarantees freedom of expression to ""everyone"". No distinction is made in it according to whether the type of aim pursued is profit-making or not (see, mutatis mutandis, the Autronic AG v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 178, p. 23, para. 47) and a difference in treatment in this sphere might fall foul of Article 14 (art. 14).', 'In its Barthold v. Germany judgment of 25 March 1985 (Series A no. 90, pp. 20-21, para. 42) the Court left open the question whether commercial advertising as such came within the scope of the guarantees under Article 10 (art. 10), but its later case-law provides guidance on this matter. Article 10 (art. 10) does not apply solely to certain types of information or ideas or forms of expression (see the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, p. 17, para. 26), in particular those of a political nature; it also encompasses artistic expression (see the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 19, para. 27), information of a commercial nature (see the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment previously cited, ibid.) - as the Commission rightly pointed out - and even light music and commercials transmitted by cable (see the Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 22, paras. 54-55).', '36. In the instant case the impugned notices merely gave the applicant ’ s name, profession, address and telephone number. They were clearly published with the aim of advertising, but they provided persons requiring legal assistance with information that was of definite use and likely to facilitate their access to justice.', '37. Article 10 (art. 10) is therefore applicable.', 'B. Compliance with Article 10 (art. 10)', '1. Whether there was an interference by a ""public authority""', '38. The Government submitted that if there was an interference, it did not come from a ""public authority"" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 1 (art. 10-1). The Barcelona Bar Council ’ s written warning (see paragraph 10 above) could be regarded as an internal sanction imposed on Mr Casado Coca by his peers. The Spanish State had merely ratified, in the form of a royal decree, the statute drawn up by the members of the Bar themselves, under Article 31 of which professional advertising was banned (see paragraph 22 above).', '39. Like the applicant and the Commission, the Court notes, however, that section 1 of the 1974 Law on professional associations states that they are public-law corporations (see paragraph 20 above). In the case of the Bars, this status is further buttressed by their purpose of serving the public interest through the furtherance of free, adequate legal assistance combined with public supervision of the practice of the profession and of compliance with professional ethics (see, in the case of a Bar, the Van der Mussele v. Belgium judgment of 23 November 1983, Series A no. 70, p. 15, para. 29 in fine, and the H. v. Belgium judgment of 30 November 1987, Series A no. 127-B, pp. 27-28, paras. 24-29; see also, mutatis mutandis, in the case of a medical association, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 26-27, para. 64). Furthermore, the impugned decision was adopted in accordance with the provisions applicable to members of the Barcelona Bar and an appeal against it lay to the competent courts (see paragraph 22 above). These courts and the Constitutional Court, all of which are State institutions, upheld the penalty (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 15 above). That being so, it is reasonable to hold that there was an interference by a ""public authority"" with Mr Casado Coca ’ s freedom to impart information.', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '40. Such an interference contravenes Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", had an aim that was legitimate under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the aforementioned aim (see, in particular, the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 25, para. 56).', '(a) ""Prescribed by law""', '41. The applicant contended that the penalty complained of lacked a valid basis in law. The 1974 Law had become null and void after the 1978 Constitution came into force, under which any earlier provisions contrary to it were repealed (see paragraph 19 above). Since the Statute of the Spanish Bar had been adopted pursuant to that Law, it had been affected in the same way.', '42. It was common ground between the Government and the Commission that the disciplinary measure was based on the ban on advertising imposed on members of the Bar by Article 31 of the Statute of the Spanish Bar and by the Statute of the Barcelona Bar and its council ’ s decisions (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 above).', '43. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, inter alia, the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment previously cited, Series A no. 239, p. 25, para. 58). In the instant case, in rejecting the ground of appeal based on violation of the principle that only a statute can define offences and lay down penalties, the Supreme Court took as its authority the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law on the subject (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). In the light of the wording of the provisions in question (see, mutatis mutandis, the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 21, para. 37) and the state of its own case-law at the time, the Court finds this interpretation to be reasonable and likewise the Constitutional Court ’ s interpretation of Article 20 of the Constitution in its decision of 17 April 1989 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). In short, the interference was ""prescribed by law"".', '(b) Legitimate aim', '44. The Government and the Commission considered on the whole that the main aim of the ban on professional advertising by members of the Bar was the ""protection of the rights of others"", in particular the rights of the public and other members of the Bar. The Government also pointed out that advertising had always been found to be incompatible with the dignity of the profession, the respect due to fellow members of the Bar and the interests of the public.', '45. In the applicant ’ s view, the Commission ’ s opinion could only be held in cases where the advertising was comparative or untruthful, but not where a notice simply gave information about a practice. The impugned ban made it possible to perpetuate discrimination between members of the Bar in independent practice and those practising as employees, civil servants or university teachers. For the former, advertising was the only possible means of reaching potential clients, whereas the positions held by the latter afforded them greater scope for making themselves known. Furthermore, the ban did not apply to the big legal consulting firms active on an international scale or to insurance companies which also offered legal assistance. Far from being a measure protecting the independent practitioner, the ban was a way of safeguarding the interests of certain privileged members of the profession.', '46. The Court does not have any reason to doubt that the Bar rules complained of were designed to protect the interests of the public while ensuring respect for members of the Bar. In this connection, the special nature of the profession practised by members of the Bar must be considered; in their capacity as officers of the court they benefit from an exclusive right of audience and immunity from legal process in respect of their oral presentation of cases in court, but their conduct must be discreet, honest and dignified. The restrictions on advertising were traditionally justified by reference to these special features. In the case of the decision in issue, there is nothing to show that the Bar Council ’ s intention at the time did not correspond to the acknowledged aim of the legislation. Furthermore, the factors alluded to by Mr Casado Coca relate primarily to the way in which the legislation in question was applied and are therefore relevant to assessing the need for the disciplinary measure.', '(c) ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '47. The applicant contended that the penalty complained of was not ""necessary in a democratic society"", because it constituted a disproportionate interference with his right to impart commercial information, a right which members of the Bar, like other citizens, were guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10). He added that such a restriction was permissible only if it reflected a freely and democratically accepted willingness to exercise self-restraint; that was not so in the instant case.', '48. The Government considered that the impugned rules of the Spanish Bar possessed those characteristics. They reflected the conception that members of the Bar themselves had of their profession as officers of the court, which excluded practising the profession on a purely commercial basis. Furthermore, in 1982 they corresponded to the common general practice of European Bars, even if a degree of relaxation of the rules in this area has been noted since.', 'In any case, the penalty imposed on Mr Casado Coca was almost a token one in nature. It in fact sanctioned repeated advertising by Mr Casado Coca, who had already received warnings and reprimands in respect of the notices he had placed in the ""miscellaneous advertisements"" sections of several newspapers and the circulars he had sent to companies (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). That being so and where commercial speech was concerned, the Government claimed a considerable margin of appreciation for the relevant authorities.', '49. In the Commission ’ s view, banning practically all advertising by members of the Bar appeared to be excessive and scarcely compatible with the right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to impart information and its corollary, the right to receive it. The applicant ’ s notice set out particulars that were wholly neutral (his name, occupation and business address and telephone number) and did not contain information that was untrue or offensive to fellow members of the Bar. He was therefore entitled to impart that information, just as his potential clients were entitled to receive it.', '50. Under the Court ’ s case-law, the States parties to the Convention have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision as regards both the relevant rules and the decisions applying them (see, inter alia, the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment previously cited, Series A no. 165, p. 20, para. 33). Such a margin of appreciation is particularly essential in the complex and fluctuating area of unfair competition (ibid.). The same applies to advertising. In the instant case, the Court ’ s task is therefore confined to ascertaining whether the measures taken at national level are justifiable in principle and proportionate (see, inter alia, ibid. and the Barthold judgment previously cited, Series A no. 90, p. 25, para. 55).', '51. For the citizen, advertising is a means of discovering the characteristics of services and goods offered to him. Nevertheless, it may sometimes be restricted, especially to prevent unfair competition and untruthful or misleading advertising. In some contexts, the publication of even objective, truthful advertisements might be restricted in order to ensure respect for the rights of others or owing to the special circumstances of particular business activities and professions. Any such restrictions must, however, be closely scrutinised by the Court, which must weigh the requirements of those particular features against the advertising in question; to this end, the Court must look at the impugned penalty in the light of the case as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment previously cited, Series A no. 165, p. 20, para. 34).', '52. In the present case, Mr Casado Coca received a written warning from the Barcelona Bar Council on 6 April 1983 for having contravened the ban on professional advertising (see paragraphs 10 and 22 above). In confirming the penalty, the National Bar Council held that, given their nature, the notices in question went beyond the limits permitted by the relevant rules of the Barcelona Bar; the Barcelona Audiencia Territorial gave the same ground for its judgment (see paragraphs 11, 12, 24 and 25 above). The Court notes that those rules allowed advertising in certain cases - namely when a practice was being set up or when there was a change in its membership, address or telephone number - and under certain conditions (see paragraph 25 above). The ban was therefore not an absolute one.', '53. The applicant and the Commission argued that commercial undertakings such as insurance companies are not subject to restrictions on advertising their legal consulting services.', '54. In the Court ’ s opinion, however, they cannot be compared to members of the Bar in independent practice, whose special status gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts. Such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar and also the monitoring and supervisory powers vested in Bar councils.', 'Nevertheless, the rules governing the profession, particularly in the sphere of advertising, vary from one country to another according to cultural tradition. Moreover, in most of the States parties to the Convention, including Spain, there has for some time been a tendency to relax the rules as a result of the changes in their respective societies and in particular the growing role of the media in them. The Government cited the examples of the Code of Conduct for Lawyers in the European Community (Strasbourg, 28 October 1988) and the conclusions of the Conference of the European Bars (Cracow, 24 May 1991); while upholding the principle of banning advertising, these documents authorise members of the Bar to express their views to the media, to make themselves known and to take part in public debate. In accordance with these guidelines, the new rules on advertising issued by the Council of the Catalonia Bars (4 July 1991) allow the publication of circulars or articles, including in the press (see paragraph 28 above). More recently, the Government have begun to study the draft of the new Statute of the Spanish Bar (see paragraph 23 above), which permits somewhat greater freedom in this sphere.', '55. The wide range of regulations and the different rates of change in the Council of Europe ’ s member States indicate the complexity of the issue. Because of their direct, continuous contact with their members, the Bar authorities and the country ’ s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck between the various interests involved, namely the requirements of the proper administration of justice, the dignity of the profession, the right of everyone to receive information about legal assistance and affording members of the Bar the possibility of advertising their practices.', '56. In view of the above, the Court holds that at the material time - 1982-83 - the relevant authorities ’ reaction could not be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued.', '57. In conclusion, no breach of Article 10 (art. 10) has been made out.']",2,es,001-57866,0

At the material time he was working as editor-in-chief of a news agency run by a commercial company, the Deutsche Depeschendienst GmbH, of which he was a founder member and manager. This company filed a petition in bankruptcy ( Eröffnung des Konkursverfahrens ) on 31 March 1983. A new company, the Deutsche Depeschendienst AG (""the ddp ""), was created subsequently, and Mr Jacubowski became its sole director ( Vorstand ) and editor-in-chief on 3 May 1983.', '8. Shortly afterwards, he instituted two different sets of proceedings. In the first (A) he sought to challenge his dismissal and in the second (B) he claimed the right to reply to a press release issued by his employer. At almost the same time, he became involved in a third set of proceedings (C) brought against him under the Unfair Competition Act of 7 June 1909 ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb - ""the 1909 Act"").', 'A. The applicant ’ s dismissal', '9. For reasons connected with the applicant ’ s financial management, the ddp ’ s supervisory board ( Aufsichtsrat ) dismissed him without notice from all his duties on 17 July 1984. On 25 August it sent him another letter of dismissal on the ground that he had allegedly communicated inside information to third persons. Mr Jacubowski challenged the validity of the latter dismissal, which was renewed on 12 October. A further dismissal letter was sent to him on 28 October, after he had distributed a circular letter and newspaper cuttings among fellow professionals on 25 September (see paragraph 14 below). A final dismissal notice, based on new grounds, was sent to him on 12 February 1985.', '10. At the end of legal proceedings instituted by the applicant, the Cologne Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ) held on 11 October 1988 that he had been validly dismissed on 28 October 1984.', 'According to the court, the distribution of the circular and cuttings was to be regarded as such a serious breach of Mr Jacubowski ’ s duty of loyalty that it was not possible for the employer to continue his contract, nor could it reasonably be expected. By sending press articles to a large number of influential professionals and endorsing in the circular their objectively unfavourable statements about the ddp ’ s competence and business situation, Mr Jacubowski had knowingly run the risk of causing the company considerable prejudice; such behaviour on the part of a leading employee was unacceptable and therefore not covered by the constitutional right to freedom of expression.', 'Furthermore, it could not be inferred from the circular that its main aim was to defend the applicant ’ s reputation and honour; it contained neither any reference to the ddp ’ s allegations nor any arguments in Mr Jacubowski ’ s defence. The circular ’ s last paragraph clearly showed that the sole purpose of the mailing had been to disseminate adverse comments on the applicant ’ s former employer and to establish contact with the addressees.', '11. Mr Jacubowski challenged this judgment in the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) and the Federal Constitutional Court ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ), but on 26 June and 25 October 1989 respectively those courts declined to accept for adjudication his applications on the ground that they had no prospects of success.', 'B. The applicant ’ s reply to his employer ’ s press release', '12. In the meantime, on 16 August 1984, the agency had published a press release concerning its own reorganisation. In this it also criticised the applicant ’ s management in the following terms:', '""... after the private limited company ... had filed a petition in bankruptcy on 31 March 1983, the public limited company D. - again under the management of Manfred Jacubowski - started up on 20 April 1983 with a capital of one million DM. Jacubowski ’ s unchanged business methods and his inappropriate behaviour to clients, together with the lack of any efficient, reliable editorial management meant that no advantage was taken of the opportunity to make a fresh start, and indeed they led to a loss of clients. Until this spring Jacubowski misled the supervisory board about vital aspects of the developments. In particular, liabilities incurred in the private company ’ s period of existence were transferred to the public company, and this put the D. agency into financial difficulties again. Only the timely intervention of the former finance and accounting director, K., the current director, prevented more serious harm being done, so that today D. is once again on a sound financial footing. On 17 July - the date of the general meeting - Jacubowski was dismissed without notice on account of his business incompetence ... K. was appointed sole director.""', '13. On 29 August and 4 September 1984 the applicant requested the ddp to publish his reply ( Gegendarstellung ) to the press release, but without success. He then sought an interim injunction ( einstweilige Verfügung ) from the Bonn Regional Court ( Landgericht ), but this was refused on 17 September 1984, on the ground that the proposed reply was not limited to answering the allegations of fact in the press release ( gegenteilige Tatsachenbehauptung ) but gave a completely new version of the sequence of events ( Auflistung ), which had not been an issue in the ddp ’ s press release.', 'On 11 October the Cologne Court of Appeal reversed the Regional Court ’ s judgment and ordered the agency to accede to Mr Jacubowski ’ s request, which it did a month later. In the reply then published the applicant answered in detail all the main accusations contained in the ddp ’ s press release.', 'C. The proceedings under the Unfair Competition Act', '14. In the meantime, on 25 September 1984, Mr Jacubowski had sent thirteen articles from newspapers with large circulations to forty newspaper publishers and newspaper, radio and television journalists who, as clients of the ddp, had received the press release of 16 August (see paragraph 12 above). These articles gave critical accounts of his dismissal, the circumstances surrounding it and the ddp ’ s activities in general. They reported in particular that the ddp ’ s financial position had worsened again since the bankruptcy in April 1983 (see paragraph 7 above) and that some of its clients were preparing to dispense with its services, mainly because of their poor standard and the lack of certain technical facilities.', 'He had appended a circular letter that read as follows:', '""The enclosed selection - which is inevitably incomplete - of articles on the Jacubowski v. D. case will undoubtedly throw light on certain matters that are still obscure, even though you may already be familiar with one or other of the accounts of the facts. Some of the facts are admittedly reported inaccurately, but they scarcely alter the picture as a whole. The pending court proceedings that members of D. ’ s staff affected by current developments at the agency and I have brought will ensure that all the details finally become clear.', 'I should be glad to be able to meet you in person before too long, in order to discuss not only the past but also future developments in the German ‘ news market ’. I will ask for an appointment in due course.""', '15. Shortly afterwards, on 11 March 1985, the applicant set up a ""public-relations"" agency.', '16. In the meantime the E. company, which had acquired 25% of the ddp ’ s capital, had applied for a restraining injunction ( Unterlassung ) against Mr Jacubowski. On 29 January 1986 the Düsseldorf Regional Court refused the application on the ground that E. had no legal interest ( rechtliches Interesse ).', '17. On 11 December 1986, on an appeal by E., joined ( Eintritt in den Rechtsstreit ) by the agency, the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal refused to grant an injunction prohibiting the applicant from systematically criticising the ddp but ordered that he should desist from any further such mailings, on pain of a fine; it went on to hold that he would have to ""compensate the [E. company] for all the damage that the acts [in question] ha[d] caused and [would] cause the [ ddp ]"". The judgment was based on section 1 of the 1909 Act, which provides: ""Any person who, in the course of business commits, for purposes of competition, acts contrary to accepted moral standards may be enjoined from further engaging in those acts and held liable for damages.""', 'The court held that in his circular the respondent had repeated in his own name the allegations made in the attached articles. Admittedly, he had sought to correct assertions made about him in the press release that were possibly false but he had acted above all for purposes of competition in the course of business.', 'The court said, inter alia:', '""... the respondent sent his circular of 25 September 1984 for purposes of competition in the course of business.', 'An action is said to be for purposes of competition where it is on the face of it apt to promote one person ’ s sales to the detriment of another ’ s and where it is carried out with a corresponding intention, although that intention need not be the only or the essential motive for the action (settled case-law, see Federal Court of Justice in GRUR 1952, p. 410 - Constanze I; Baumbach-Hefermehl, Wettbewerbsrecht, 14th edition, intro. to Unfair Competition Act, marginal notes 209 et seq., with further references).', 'Remarks which, according to the witness Leisner, the respondent made several times show that even before sending out the circular the latter had planned to set up his own news agency after he left the employ of the [ ddp ]. The distribution of the circular referring to the enclosed adverse newspaper reports on, inter alia, the [ ddp ] ’ s activities as a news agency to current clients of the [ ddp ] and/or potential clients of both the [ ddp ] and the news agency that the respondent proposed to set up was apt to enhance the competitive position of the respondent ’ s company and impair that of the [ ddp ]. Admittedly, the respondent ’ s company did not then exist. However, for it to be held that there is a competitive relationship, it is sufficient that traders have, or at least will in the future have, the same potential clientele. This was the case as regards the respondent ’ s company and the [ ddp ] ...', 'Behind the respondent ’ s conduct there was furthermore a ... competitive intention.', 'Experience shows that the fact that activities are objectively apt to enhance one ’ s own competitive position at the expense of another ’ s is not the only basis for presuming a competitive intention ...', 'In the present case such an intention is also apparent from the other facts that emerged during the proceedings. According to what he told the witness Leisner, the respondent had already been planning for a long time to set up his own agency in the event of his leaving the [ ddp ] ’ s service. In the middle of July 1984 the [ ddp ] had removed him from the post of director and in the middle of August [it] had terminated his contract of employment. The circular and newspaper cuttings were sent out about a month later to selected addressees, including - and this is not disputed - important clients of the [ ddp ]. A few months later the respondent ’ s new agency was set up. This chronological sequence of events is a further indication of the respondent ’ s intention to lower the [ ddp ] in the esteem of potential clients of both parties and thereby make it easier for his own agency to gain a foothold in the market in preparation for competition with the [ ddp ].', 'The last paragraph of the circular likewise makes the competitive intention clear. It shows that the respondent intended to provoke discussion not only with a view to correcting assertions concerning himself that were possibly false, but also, at the very least, in order to promote his future activities as a competitor of the [ ddp ]. It is not apparent what else the respondent could have meant when he wrote that he wished to discuss ‘ not only the past but also future developments in the German ""news market"" ‘. By taking up these unfavourable comments on the [ ddp ] and distributing them anew as his own statements and assessments, he unnecessarily handicapped the [ ddp ] as a competitor. In this connection it does not matter whether the unfavourable factual statements concerning the [ ddp ] ’ s activities were accurate and whether they justified the unfavourable assessments accompanying them. This is because even true statements may only be used to disparage a competitor where the person making them has sufficient reason to link his own competitive position with disparagement of the competitor and provided that the criticism does not in nature or degree exceed what is necessary (Federal Court of Justice in GRUR 1968, pp. 262 and 265 - Fälschung ). It does not appear that there was any such reason to disparage the [ ddp ] by taking up the unfavourable comments on its activities in the Horizont article.""', 'In short, Mr Jacubowski had needlessly handicapped ( behinderte unnötig ) a competitor and accordingly infringed section 1 of the 1909 Act.', '18. On 26 November 1987 the Federal Court of Justice declined to accept for adjudication an appeal on points of law (Revision) by the applicant on the ground that it had no prospects of success.', '19. Thereupon Mr Jacubowski applied to the Federal Constitutional Court, complaining in particular of an infringement of freedom of expression (Article 5 para. 1, first sentence, of the Basic Law). On 4 October 1988 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to accept the complaint for adjudication on the ground that it was unfounded.', 'It noted, firstly, that the prohibition in issue related solely to the applicant ’ s chosen method of circulating his information. The information was, moreover, of a business nature, but this did not mean that it ceased to be an opinion whose expression was protected by Article 5 para. 1, first sentence, of the Basic Law. This provision therefore had to be weighed against section 1 of the 1909 Act, on which the prohibition had been founded.', 'The court went on:', '""In order for it to be determined how [freedom of expression and fair competition] are to be related to each other in the case of damaging comment by a competitor, the following points are decisive, having regard to earlier decisions of the Constitutional Court in cases involving a call for a boycott (see Constitutional Court Decisions [vol.] 62, 230 at 244 et seq., with further references).', 'In the first place, the motives of the person concerned and, linked to them, the aim and purpose of the comment are crucial. If the comment is motivated not by personal interests of an economic nature, but by concern for the political, economic, social or cultural interests of the community, if it serves to influence public opinion, the appeal will probably qualify for the protection of Article 5 para. 1 of the Basic Law, even if private and, more particularly, economic interests are adversely affected as a result. Conversely, the importance of protecting the latter interests is the greater, the less the comment is a contribution to public debate on a major issue of public concern and the more it is immediately directed against those interests in the course of business and in pursuit of a self-serving goal (see Constitutional Court Decisions [vol.] 66, 116 at 139) such as improving one ’ s own competitive position ...', '...', 'In the light of these facts, the distribution of the applicant ’ s circular can hardly be regarded as an attempt to influence public opinion. Rather it was designed almost exclusively to promote his private business interests and to secure or improve his competitive position in the news market.', 'It follows ... that the prejudice caused to the complainants by the distribution of the circular was disproportionate to the applicant ’ s aim, stated in it, of clarifying his relationship with the ddp and ‘ current developments at the agency ’. In principle, freedom of expression takes precedence over rights ( Rechtsgüter ) protected by ordinary laws in so far as the statement is part of the ongoing discussion of questions of public importance which is absolutely fundamental to a free democratic system. This condition is not satisfied where the statement is made to ensure that certain business interests prevail over others in the context of business competition. The fact that an interest is made to prevail by means which are in principle protected under Article 5 para. 1 of the Basic Law cannot therefore justify subordinating to it the other interest, which is in turn entitled to the protection of an ordinary law that places restrictions on freedom of expression, in this case section 1 of the Unfair Competition Act (see Constitutional Court Decisions [vol.] 62, 230 at 247 et seq.). It follows that the finding by the Court of Appeal that the applicant ’ s distribution of the circular was contrary to accepted moral standards is not incompatible with Article 5 para. 1 of the Basic Law.""', 'The Constitutional Court added that the fact that the impugned circular followed a press release directed against him which had been issued by the ddp (see paragraph 12 above) did not invalidate this conclusion, since in order to claim the protection of the Constitution, his response would have had to be intended to influence public opinion, which it was not.', '20. On 30 November 1988 the Düsseldorf Regional Court dismissed a claim for damages brought by the ddp in reliance on the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 11 December 1986 (see paragraph 17 above). It held that the ddp had insufficiently substantiated its claim and had failed to prove any causal link between the alleged damage and the distribution of Mr Jacubowski ’ s circular.']","['PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '21. Mr Jacubowski applied to the Commission on 11 April 1989. Relying on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, he complained of a breach of his right to freedom of expression.', '22. The Commission declared the application (no. 15088/89) admissible on 3 December 1991. In its report of 7 January 1993 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '23. The applicant complained of the court order of 11 December 1986, later confirmed on 26 November 1987 by the Federal Court of Justice, prohibiting him from continuing to distribute his circular of 25 September 1984 (see paragraphs 17-18 above). He alleged a violation of Article 10 (art. 10), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'The order of 11 December 1986 had, he said, prevented further distribution of his reply of 25 September 1984 to a press release in which his former employer had openly put his professional abilities in question. He had tried unsuccessfully to have his reply published by the ddp itself, by applying firstly to the agency and then to the Bonn Regional Court (see paragraphs 12-13 above). These attempts having failed, he had had to resort to other means, without awaiting the judgment of the Cologne Court of Appeal, since his reputation was at stake. In any case, there had been nothing extreme about the circular in issue, which had merely approved in a few lines the substance of the attached articles from newspapers that had already been widely distributed.', 'The Commission shared this view for the most part.', '24. The Government challenged it. In issuing an injunction consequent upon an act of unfair competition, the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal had done no more than exercise a discretion in commercial matters, as it was empowered to do under the doctrine of the margin of appreciation. Although it could not be regarded as the only possible one, its decision appeared at the very least defensible in the light of the wording of the circular of 25 September 1984, in which Mr Jacubowski had first of all broadly endorsed the criticisms of the ddp in the press cuttings he reproduced and then, in the last paragraph, expressed the intention, thinly disguised, of establishing business relations between the recipients of the circular and the new agency he was preparing to set up. Rather than defend himself, he had therefore clearly denigrated a competitor the better to be able to poach clients, and this was, moreover, shown by the appreciable difference in content between the circular and the reply eventually published after the judgment of 11 October 1984 (see paragraph 13 above).', 'In addition, the national courts had shown moderation in going no further than prohibiting any redistribution of the circular of 25 September 1984; the applicant still had complete freedom to voice his opinions in any other way.', '25. The Court notes that the impugned measure was, without a doubt, an interference with Mr Jacubowski ’ s exercise of his freedom of expression. The fact that, in a given case, that freedom is exercised other than in the discussion of matters of public interest does not deprive it of the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A, p. 16, para. 35).', 'The interference was ""prescribed by law"" and pursued a legitimate aim under the Convention, namely ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"" (see, mutatis mutandis, the Barthold v. Germany judgment of 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90, pp. 21-23, paras. 44-51, and the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, pp. 17-19, paras. 27-31). It consequently remains to be ascertained whether the interference can be regarded as having been ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '26. The Court has consistently held that a certain margin of appreciation is to be left to the Contracting States in assessing whether and to what extent an interference is necessary, but this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision covering both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court.', 'Such a margin of appreciation appears essential in commercial matters, in particular in an area as complex and fluctuating as that of unfair competition. The Court must confine its review to the question whether the measures taken at national level are justifiable in principle and proportionate (see the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment previously cited, pp. 19-20, para. 33).', '27. In the instant case the requirements of protecting the reputation and rights of others must be weighed against the applicant ’ s freedom to distribute his circular and the newspaper cuttings.', 'All three of the national courts that considered the merits of Mr Jacubowski ’ s course of action were unanimous in regarding it as an act of unfair competition in breach of ""accepted moral standards"", as in their view it had been mainly designed to draw the ddp ’ s clients away to the new press agency that he set up shortly afterwards. Their judgments were based principally on the circular ’ s wording, especially its last paragraph, in which, so they held, the sender clearly expressed his wish to establish personal business contacts with the addressees. The domestic courts further relied on testimony that, even before sending his circular, the applicant had planned to found his own news agency (see paragraphs 10, 15, 17 and 19 above). The evidence put before the Court does not undermine that conclusion.', '28. All three domestic courts took into account the fact that Mr Jacubowski had been personally attacked in a press release issued by his former employer. However, in view of the aforementioned circumstances, they attached less importance to it than to what they regarded as the cardinal feature, namely the essentially competitive purpose of the exercise. In the reply he eventually published Mr Jacubowski responded in detail to the main accusations contained in the ddp ’ s press release; but the content of his reply was substantially different from that of his circular (see paragraph 13 above).', '29. Lastly, it should be emphasised that the impugned court order went no further than to prohibit distribution of the circular; the Düsseldorf Court of Appeal refused the ddp ’ s application for an injunction prohibiting Mr Jacubowski from systematically criticising the ddp (see paragraph 17 above). He thus retained the right to voice his opinions and to defend himself by any other means. The interference complained of therefore cannot be regarded as disproportionate.', '30. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the German courts overstepped the margin of appreciation left to national authorities and no breach of Article 10 (art. 10) has been made out.']",3,de,001-57879,0

THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE', '9. The applicant, Otto-Preminger-Institut für audiovisuelle Mediengestaltung (OPI), is a private association under Austrian law established in Innsbruck. According to its articles of association, it is a non-profit-making organisation, its general aim being to promote creativity, communication and entertainment through the audiovisual media. Its activities include operating a cinema called ""Cinematograph"" in Innsbruck.', '10. The applicant association announced a series of six showings, which would be accessible to the general public, of the film Das Liebeskonzil (""Council in Heaven"") by Werner Schroeter (see paragraph 22 below). The first of these showings was scheduled for 13 May 1985. All were to take place at 10.00 p.m. except for one matinée performance on 19 May at 4 p.m.', 'This announcement was made in an information bulletin distributed by OPI to its 2,700 members and in various display windows in Innsbruck including that of the Cinematograph itself. It was worded as follows:', '""Oskar Panizza ’ s satirical tragedy set in Heaven was filmed by Schroeter from a performance by the Teatro Belli in Rome and set in the context of a reconstruction of the writer ’ s trial and conviction in 1895 for blasphemy. Panizza starts from the assumption that syphilis was God ’ s punishment for man ’ s fornication and sinfulness at the time of the Renaissance, especially at the court of the Borgia Pope Alexander VI. In Schroeter ’ s film, God ’ s representatives on Earth carrying the insignia of worldly power closely resemble the heavenly protagonists.', 'Trivial imagery and absurdities of the Christian creed are targeted in a caricatural mode and the relationship between religious beliefs and worldly mechanisms of oppression is investigated.""', 'In addition, the information bulletin carried a statement to the effect that, in accordance with the Tyrolean Cinemas Act (Tiroler Lichtspielgesetz), persons under seventeen years of age were prohibited from seeing the film.', 'A regional newspaper also announced the title of the film and the date and place of the showing without giving any particulars as to its contents.', '11. At the request of the Innsbruck diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against OPI ’ s manager, Mr Dietmar Zingl, on 10 May 1985. The charge was ""disparaging religious doctrines"" (Herabwürdigung religiöser Lehren), an act prohibited by section 188 of the Penal Code (Strafgesetzbuch - see paragraph 25 below).', '12. On 12 May 1985, after the film had been shown at a private session in the presence of a duty judge (Journalrichter), the public prosecutor made an application for its seizure under section 36 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz - see paragraph 29 below). This application was granted by the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht) the same day. As a result, the public showings announced by OPI, the first of which had been scheduled for the next day, could not take place.', 'Those who attended at the time set for the first showing were treated to a reading of the script and a discussion instead.', 'As Mr Zingl had returned the film to the distributor, the ""Czerny"" company in Vienna, it was in fact seized at the latter ’ s premises on 11 June 1985.', '13. An appeal by Mr Zingl against the seizure order, filed with the Innsbruck Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), was dismissed on 30 July 1985. The Court of Appeal considered that artistic freedom was necessarily limited by the rights of others to freedom of religion and by the duty of the State to safeguard a society based on order and tolerance. It further held that indignation was ""justified"" for the purposes of section 188 of the Penal Code only if its object was such as to offend the religious feelings of an average person with normal religious sensitivity. That condition was fulfilled in the instant case and forfeiture of the film could be ordered in principle, at least in ""objective proceedings"" (see paragraph 28 below). The wholesale derision of religious feeling outweighed any interest the general public might have in information or the financial interests of persons wishing to show the film.', '14. On 24 October 1985 the criminal prosecution against Mr Zingl was discontinued and the case was pursued in the form of ""objective proceedings"" under section 33 para. 2 of the Media Act aimed at suppression of the film.', '15. On 10 October 1986 a trial took place before the Innsbruck Regional Court. The film was again shown in closed session; its contents were described in detail in the official record of the hearing.', 'Mr Zingl appears in the official record of the hearing as a witness. He stated that he had sent the film back to the distributor following the seizure order because he wanted nothing more to do with the matter.', 'It appears from the judgment - which was delivered the same day - that Mr Zingl was considered to be a ""potentially liable interested party"" (Haftungsbeteiligter).', 'The Regional Court found it to be established that the distributor of the film had waived its right to be heard and had agreed to the destruction of its copy of the film.', '16. In its judgment the Regional Court ordered the forfeiture of the film. It held:', '""The public projection scheduled for 13 May 1985 of the film Das Liebeskonzil, in which God the Father is presented both in image and in text as a senile, impotent idiot, Christ as a cretin and Mary Mother of God as a wanton lady with a corresponding manner of expression and in which the Eucharist is ridiculed, came within the definition of the criminal offence of disparaging religious precepts as laid down in section 188 of the Penal Code.""', 'The court ’ s reasoning included the following:', '""The conditions of section 188 of the Penal Code are objectively fulfilled by this portrayal of the divine persons - God the Father, Mary Mother of God and Jesus Christ are the central figures in Roman Catholic religious doctrine and practice, being of the most essential importance, also for the religious understanding of the believers - as well as by the above-mentioned expressions concerning the Eucharist, which is one of the most important mysteries of the Roman Catholic religion, the more so in view of the general character of the film as an attack on Christian religions ...', '... Article 17a of the Basic Law (Staatsgrundgesetz) guarantees the freedom of artistic creation and the publication and teaching of art. The scope of artistic freedom was broadened (by the introduction of that article) to the extent that every form of artistic expression is protected and limitations of artistic freedom are no longer possible by way of an express legal provision but may only follow from the limitations inherent in this freedom .... Artistic freedom cannot be unlimited. The limitations on artistic freedom are to be found, firstly, in other basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution (such as the freedom of religion and conscience), secondly, in the need for an ordered form of human coexistence based on tolerance, and finally in flagrant and extreme violations of other interests protected by law (Verletzung anderer rechtlich geschützter Güter), the specific circumstances having to be weighed up against each other in each case, taking due account of all relevant considerations ...', 'The fact that the conditions of section 188 of the Penal Code are fulfilled does not automatically mean that the limit of the artistic freedom guaranteed by Article 17a of the Basic Law has been reached. However, in view of the above considerations and the particular gravity in the instant case - which concerned a film primarily intended to be provocative and aimed at the Church - of the multiple and sustained violation of legally protected interests, the basic right of artistic freedom will in the instant case have to come second.', '...""', '17. Mr Zingl appealed against the judgment of the Regional Court, submitting a declaration signed by some 350 persons who protested that they had been prevented from having free access to a work of art, and claiming that section 188 of the Penal Code had not been interpreted in line with the guarantee of freedom of art laid down by Article 17a of the Basic Law.', 'The Innsbruck Court of Appeal declared the appeal inadmissible on 25 March 1987. It found that Mr Zingl had no standing, as he was not the owner of the copyright of the film. The judgment was notified to OPI on 7 April 1987.', '18. Prompted by the applicant association ’ s lawyer, the then Minister for Education, Arts and Sports, Dr Hilde Hawlicek, wrote a private letter to the Attorney General (Generalprokurator) suggesting the filing of a plea of nullity for safeguarding the law (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes) with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof). The letter was dated 18 May 1987 and mentioned, inter alia, Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'The Attorney General decided on 26 July 1988 that there were no grounds for filing such a plea of nullity. The decision mentioned, inter alia, that the Attorney General ’ s Department (Generalprokuratur) had long held the view that artistic freedom was limited by other basic rights and referred to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case concerning the film Das Gespenst (""The Ghost"" - see paragraph 26 below); in the Attorney General ’ s opinion, in that case the Supreme Court had ""at least not disapproved"" of that view (""Diese Auffassung ... wurde vom Obersten Gerichtshof ... zumindest nicht mißbilligt"").', '19. There have been theatre performances of the original play in Austria since then: in Vienna in November 1991, and in Innsbruck in October 1992. In Vienna the prosecuting authorities took no action. In Innsbruck several criminal complaints (Strafanzeigen) were laid by private persons; preliminary investigations were conducted, following which the prosecuting authorities decided to discontinue the proceedings.', 'II. THE FILM ""DAS LIEBESKONZIL""', '20. The play on which the film is based was written by Oskar Panizza and published in 1894. In 1895 Panizza was found guilty by the Munich Assize Court (Schwurgericht) of ""crimes against religion"" and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The play was banned in Germany although it continued in print elsewhere.', '21. The play portrays God the Father as old, infirm and ineffective, Jesus Christ as a ""mummy ’ s boy"" of low intelligence and the Virgin Mary, who is obviously in charge, as an unprincipled wanton. Together they decide that mankind must be punished for its immorality. They reject the possibility of outright destruction in favour of a form of punishment which will leave it both ""in need of salvation"" and ""capable of redemption"". Being unable to think of such a punishment by themselves, they decide to call on the Devil for help.', 'The Devil suggests the idea of a sexually transmitted affliction, so that men and women will infect one another without realising it; he procreates with Salome to produce a daughter who will spread it among mankind. The symptoms as described by the Devil are those of syphilis.', 'As his reward, the Devil claims freedom of thought; Mary says that she will ""think about it"". The Devil then dispatches his daughter to do her work, first among those who represent worldly power, then to the court of the Pope, to the bishops, to the convents and monasteries and finally to the common people.', '22. The film, directed by Werner Schroeter, was released in 1981. It begins and ends with scenes purporting to be taken from the trial of Panizza in 1895. In between, it shows a performance of the play by the Teatro Belli in Rome. The film portrays the God of the Jewish religion, the Christian religion and the Islamic religion as an apparently senile old man prostrating himself before the Devil with whom he exchanges a deep kiss and calling the Devil his friend. He is also portrayed as swearing by the Devil. Other scenes show the Virgin Mary permitting an obscene story to be read to her and the manifestation of a degree of erotic tension between the Virgin Mary and the Devil. The adult Jesus Christ is portrayed as a low grade mental defective and in one scene is shown lasciviously attempting to fondle and kiss his mother ’ s breasts, which she is shown as permitting. God, the Virgin Mary and Christ are shown in the film applauding the Devil.']","['III. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', '23. Religious freedom is guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law, which reads:', '""(1) Complete freedom of beliefs and conscience is guaranteed to everyone.', '(2) Enjoyment of civil and political rights shall be independent of religious confessions; however, a religious confession may not stand in the way of civic duties.', '(3) No one shall be compelled to take any church-related action or to participate in any church-related celebration, except in pursuance of a power conferred by law on another person to whose authority he is subject.""', '24. Artistic freedom is guaranteed by Article 17a of the Basic Law, which provides:', '""There shall be freedom of artistic creation and of the publication and teaching of art.""', '25. Section 188 of the Penal Code reads as follows:', '""Whoever, in circumstances where his behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation, disparages or insults a person who, or an object which, is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country, or a dogma, a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community, shall be liable to a prison sentence of up to six months or a fine of up to 360 daily rates.""', '26. The leading judgment of the Supreme Court on the relationship between the above two provisions was delivered after a plea of nullity for safeguarding the law filed by the Attorney General in a case concerning forfeiture of the film Das Gespenst (""The Ghost"") by Herbert Achternbusch. Although the plea was dismissed on purely formal grounds without any decision on the merits, it appeared obliquely from the judgment that if a work of art impinges on the freedom of religious worship guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law, that may constitute an abuse of the freedom of artistic expression and therefore be contrary to the law (judgment of 19 December 1985, Medien und Recht (Media and Law) 1986, no. 2, p. 15).', '27. A media offence (Medieninhaltsdelikt) is defined as ""[a]n act entailing liability to a judicial penalty, committed through the content of a publication medium, consisting in a communication or performance aimed at a relatively large number of persons"" (section 1 para. 12 of the Media Act). Criminal liability for such offences is determined according to the general penal law, in so far as it is not derogated from or added to by special provisions of the Media Act (section 28 of the Media Act).', '28. A specific sanction provided for by the Media Act is forfeiture (Einziehung) of the publication concerned (section 33). Forfeiture may be ordered in addition to any normal sanction under the Penal Code (section 33 para. 1).', 'If prosecution or conviction of any person for a criminal offence is not possible, forfeiture can also be ordered in separate so-called ""objective"" proceedings for the suppression of a publication, as provided for under section 33 para. 2 of the Media Act, by virtue of which:', '""Forfeiture shall be ordered in separate proceedings at the request of the public prosecutor if a publication in the media satisfies the objective definition of a criminal offence and if the prosecution of a particular person cannot be secured or if conviction of such person is impossible on grounds precluding punishment ...""', '29. The seizure (Beschlagnahme) of a publication pending the decision on forfeiture may be effected pursuant to section 36 of the Media Act, which reads:', '""1. The court may order the seizure of the copies intended for distribution to the public of a work published through the media if it can be assumed that forfeiture will be ordered under section 33 and if the adverse consequences of such seizure are not disproportionate to the legitimate interests served thereby. Seizure may not be effected in any case if such legitimate interests can also be served by publication of a notice concerning the criminal proceedings instituted.', '2. Seizure presupposes the prior or simultaneous institution of criminal proceedings or objective proceedings concerning a media offence and an express application to that effect by the public prosecutor or the complainant in separate proceedings.', '3. The decision ordering seizure shall mention the passage or part of the published work and the suspected offence having prompted the seizure ...', '4-5. ...""', '30. The general law of criminal procedure applies to the prosecution of media offences and to objective proceedings. Although in objective proceedings the owner or publisher of the published work does not stand accused of any criminal offence, he is treated as a full party, by virtue of section 41 para. 5, which reads:', '""[In criminal proceedings or objective proceedings concerning a media offence] the media owner (publisher) shall be summoned to the hearing. He shall have the rights of the accused; in particular, he shall be entitled to the same defences as the accused and to appeal against the judgment on the merits ...""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '31. The applicant association applied to the Commission on 6 October 1987. It alleged violations of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', '32. On 12 April 1991 the Commission declared the application (no. 13470/87) admissible.', 'In its report adopted on 14 January 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10):', '(a) as regards the seizure of the film (nine votes to five);', '(b) as regards the forfeiture of the film (thirteen votes to one).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '33. The Government, in their memorial, requested the Court', '""to reject the application as inadmissible under Article 27 para. 3 (art. 27-3) of the Convention for failure to observe the six-month rule in Article 26 (art. 26) of the Convention, or alternatively, to state that there has been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention in connection with the seizure and subsequent forfeiture of the film"".', '34. At the hearing, the applicant asked the Court to', '""decide in favour of the applicant association and find that the seizure and forfeiture of the film were in breach of the Republic of Austria ’ s obligations arising from Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, and that just satisfaction as specified be afforded to the applicant association"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. THE GOVERNMENT ’ S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS', '35. The Government maintained that the application, which was introduced on 6 October 1987 (see paragraph 31 above), had been lodged with the Commission after the expiry of the six-month time-limit laid down in Article 26 (art. 26) of the Convention, which reads:', '""The Commission may only deal with the matter ... within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.""', 'In the first place, they argued that the applicant association (OPI) was a ""party"" only in the proceedings as to the seizure of the film, not its forfeiture. The final domestic decision was therefore that of the Innsbruck Court of Appeal confirming the seizure order (30 July 1985).', 'In the alternative, the Government pointed out that the distributor of the film, the ""Czerny"" company, being the sole holder of the rights to the only copy of the film, had consented to its destruction before the first hearing in the ""objective proceedings"" by the Innsbruck Regional Court. That court had in fact ordered the forfeiture of the film on 10 October 1986. The ""Czerny"" company not having appealed against that order, the Government argued that it should be counted the final domestic decision.', 'Acceptance of either position would mean that the application was out of time.', 'A. Whether the Government is estopped from relying on its alternative submission', '36. The Delegate of the Commission suggested that the Government should be considered estopped from invoking its alternative plea, which had not been raised before the Commission at the admissibility stage. In his view, the fact that the Government had pleaded an objection based on the time-limit of six months laid down in Article 26 (art. 26) should not be regarded as sufficient, since the argument made then was based on facts different from those now relied on.', '37. The Court takes cognisance of objections of this kind if and in so far as the respondent State has already raised them sufficiently clearly before the Commission to the extent that their nature and the circumstances permitted. This should normally be done at the stage of the initial examination of admissibility (see, among many other authorities, the Bricmont v. Belgium judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 27, para. 73).', 'Although the Government did invoke the six-month rule before the Commission, they relied only on the judgment of the Innsbruck Court of Appeal of 30 July 1985. There was nothing to prevent them from raising their alternative argument at the same time. It follows that they are estopped from doing so before the Court (see, as the most recent authority, the Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 260-B, p. 68, para. 36).', 'B. Whether the Government ’ s principal plea is well-founded', '38. The Government ’ s argument is in effect that OPI is not a ""victim"" of the forfeiture of the film, as opposed to its seizure.', '39. A person can properly claim to be a ""victim"" of an interference with the exercise of his rights under the Convention if he has been directly affected by the matters allegedly constituting the interference (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, pp. 15-16, para. 31, and the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246, p. 22, para. 43).', '40. Although the applicant association was not the owner of either the copyright or the forfeited copy of the film, it was directly affected by the decision on forfeiture, which had the effect of making it impossible for it ever to show the film in its cinema in Innsbruck or, indeed, anywhere in Austria. In addition, the seizure was a provisional measure the legality of which was confirmed by the decision on forfeiture; the two cannot be separated. Finally, it is not without significance that the applicant association ’ s manager appears in the Regional Court ’ s judgment of 10 October 1986 in the forfeiture proceedings as a ""potentially liable interested party"" (see paragraph 15 above).', 'The applicant association can therefore validly claim to be a ""victim"" of the forfeiture of the film as well as its seizure.', '41. It follows from the foregoing that the ""final decision"" for the purpose of Article 26 (art. 26) was the judgment given by the Innsbruck Court of Appeal on 25 March 1987 and notified to OPI on 7 April (see paragraph 17 above). In accordance with its usual practice, the Commission decided that the application, which had been lodged within six months of the latter date, had been filed within the requisite time-limit. The Government ’ s preliminary objection must accordingly be rejected.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '42. The applicant association submitted that the seizure and subsequent forfeiture of the film Das Liebeskonzil gave rise to violations of its right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'A. Whether there have been ""interferences"" with the applicant association ’ s freedom of expression', '43. Although before the Commission the Government had conceded the existence of an interference with the exercise by the applicant association of its right to freedom of expression only with respect to the seizure of the film and although the same point was made in their preliminary objection (see paragraph 35 above), before the Court it was no longer in dispute that if the preliminary objection were rejected both the seizure and the forfeiture constituted such interferences.', 'Such interferences will entail violation of Article 10 (art. 10) if they do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 2 (art. 10-2). The Court must therefore examine in turn whether the interferences were ""prescribed by law"", whether they pursued an aim that was legitimate under that paragraph (art. 10-2) and whether they were ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the achievement of that aim.', 'B. Whether the interferences were ""prescribed by law""', '44. The applicant association denied that the interferences were ""prescribed by law"", claiming that section 188 of the Austrian Penal Code had been wrongly applied. Firstly, it was in its view doubtful whether a work of art dealing in a satirical way with persons or objects of religious veneration could ever be regarded as ""disparaging or insulting"". Secondly, indignation could not be ""justified"" in persons who consented of their own free will to see the film or decided not to. Thirdly, the right to artistic freedom, as guaranteed by Article 17a of the Basic Law, had been given insufficient weight.', '45. The Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, p. 36, para. 25).', 'The Innsbruck courts had to strike a balance between the right to artistic freedom and the right to respect for religious beliefs as guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law. The Court, like the Commission, finds that no grounds have been adduced before it for holding that Austrian law was wrongly applied.', 'C. Whether the interferences had a ""legitimate aim""', '46. The Government maintained that the seizure and forfeiture of the film were aimed at ""the protection of the rights of others"", particularly the right to respect for one ’ s religious feelings, and at ""the prevention of disorder"".', '47. As the Court pointed out in its judgment in the case of Kokkinakis v. Greece of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 17, para. 31), freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which is safeguarded under Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention, is one of the foundations of a ""democratic society"" within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life.', 'Those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion, irrespective of whether they do so as members of a religious majority or a minority, cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith. However, the manner in which religious beliefs and doctrines are opposed or denied is a matter which may engage the responsibility of the State, notably its responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 (art. 9) to the holders of those beliefs and doctrines. Indeed, in extreme cases the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs can be such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them.', 'In the Kokkinakis judgment the Court held, in the context of Article 9 (art. 9), that a State may legitimately consider it necessary to take measures aimed at repressing certain forms of conduct, including the imparting of information and ideas, judged incompatible with the respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others (ibid., p. 21, para. 48). The respect for the religious feelings of believers as guaranteed in Article 9 (art. 9) can legitimately be thought to have been violated by provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration; and such portrayals can be regarded as malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance, which must also be a feature of democratic society. The Convention is to be read as a whole and therefore the interpretation and application of Article 10 (art. 10) in the present case must be in harmony with the logic of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 31, para. 68).', '48. The measures complained of were based on section 188 of the Austrian Penal Code, which is intended to suppress behaviour directed against objects of religious veneration that is likely to cause ""justified indignation"". It follows that their purpose was to protect the right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings by the public expression of views of other persons. Considering also the terms in which the decisions of the Austrian courts were phrased, the Court accepts that the impugned measures pursued a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), namely ""the protection of the rights of others"".', 'D. Whether the seizure and the forfeiture were ""necessary in a democratic society""', '1. General principles', '49. As the Court has consistently held, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of everyone. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that shock, offend or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"" (see, particularly, the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, para. 49).', 'However, as is borne out by the wording itself of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), whoever exercises the rights and freedoms enshrined in the first paragraph of that Article (art. 10-1) undertakes ""duties and responsibilities"". Amongst them - in the context of religious opinions and beliefs - may legitimately be included an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs.', 'This being so, as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent improper attacks on objects of religious veneration, provided always that any ""formality"", ""condition"", ""restriction"" or ""penalty"" imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the Handyside judgment referred to above, ibid.).', '50. As in the case of ""morals"" it is not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society (see the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 20, para. 30, and p. 22, para. 35); even within a single country such conceptions may vary. For that reason it is not possible to arrive at a comprehensive definition of what constitutes a permissible interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression where such expression is directed against the religious feelings of others. A certain margin of appreciation is therefore to be left to the national authorities in assessing the existence and extent of the necessity of such interference.', 'The authorities ’ margin of appreciation, however, is not unlimited. It goes hand in hand with Convention supervision, the scope of which will vary according to the circumstances. In cases such as the present one, where there has been an interference with the exercise of the freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1), the supervision must be strict because of the importance of the freedoms in question. The necessity for any restriction must be convincingly established (see, as the most recent authority, the Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276, p. 15, para. 35).', '2. Application of the above principles', '51. The film which was seized and forfeited by judgments of the Austrian courts was based on a theatre play, but the Court is concerned only with the film production in question.', '(a) The seizure', '52. The Government defended the seizure of the film in view of its character as an attack on the Christian religion, especially Roman Catholicism. They maintained that the placing of the original play in the setting of its author ’ s trial in 1895 actually served to reinforce the anti-religious nature of the film, which ended with a violent and abusive denunciation of what was presented as Catholic morality.', 'Furthermore, they stressed the role of religion in the everyday life of the people of Tyrol. The proportion of Roman Catholic believers among the Austrian population as a whole was already considerable - 78% - but among Tyroleans it was as high as 87%.', 'Consequently, at the material time at least, there was a pressing social need for the preservation of religious peace; it had been necessary to protect public order against the film and the Innsbruck courts had not overstepped their margin of appreciation in this regard.', '53. The applicant association claimed to have acted in a responsible way aimed at preventing unwarranted offence. It noted that it had planned to show the film in its cinema, which was accessible to members of the public only after a fee had been paid; furthermore, its public consisted on the whole of persons with an interest in progressive culture. Finally, pursuant to the relevant Tyrolean legislation in force, persons under seventeen years of age were not to be admitted to the film. There was therefore no real danger of anyone being exposed to objectionable material against their wishes.', 'The Commission agreed with this position in substance.', '54. The Court notes first of all that although access to the cinema to see the film itself was subject to payment of an admission fee and an age-limit, the film was widely advertised. There was sufficient public knowledge of the subject-matter and basic contents of the film to give a clear indication of its nature; for these reasons, the proposed screening of the film must be considered to have been an expression sufficiently ""public"" to cause offence.', '55. The issue before the Court involves weighing up the conflicting interests of the exercise of two fundamental freedoms guaranteed under the Convention, namely the right of the applicant association to impart to the public controversial views and, by implication, the right of interested persons to take cognisance of such views, on the one hand, and the right of other persons to proper respect for their freedom of thought, conscience and religion, on the other hand. In so doing, regard must be had to the margin of appreciation left to the national authorities, whose duty it is in a democratic society also to consider, within the limits of their jurisdiction, the interests of society as a whole.', '56. The Austrian courts, ordering the seizure and subsequently the forfeiture of the film, held it to be an abusive attack on the Roman Catholic religion according to the conception of the Tyrolean public. Their judgments show that they had due regard to the freedom of artistic expression, which is guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention (see the Müller and Others judgment referred to above, p. 22, para. 33) and for which Article 17a of the Austrian Basic Law provides specific protection. They did not consider that its merit as a work of art or as a contribution to public debate in Austrian society outweighed those features which made it essentially offensive to the general public within their jurisdiction. The trial courts, after viewing the film, noted the provocative portrayal of God the Father, the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ (see paragraph 16 above). The content of the film (see paragraph 22 above) cannot be said to be incapable of grounding the conclusions arrived at by the Austrian courts.', 'The Court cannot disregard the fact that the Roman Catholic religion is the religion of the overwhelming majority of Tyroleans. In seizing the film, the Austrian authorities acted to ensure religious peace in that region and to prevent that some people should feel the object of attacks on their religious beliefs in an unwarranted and offensive manner. It is in the first place for the national authorities, who are better placed than the international judge, to assess the need for such a measure in the light of the situation obtaining locally at a given time. In all the circumstances of the present case, the Court does not consider that the Austrian authorities can be regarded as having overstepped their margin of appreciation in this respect.', 'No violation of Article 10 (art. 10) can therefore be found as far as the seizure is concerned.', '(b) The forfeiture', '57. The foregoing reasoning also applies to the forfeiture, which determined the ultimate legality of the seizure and under Austrian law was the normal sequel thereto.', 'Article 10 (art. 10) cannot be interpreted as prohibiting the forfeiture in the public interest of items whose use has lawfully been adjudged illicit (see the Handyside judgment referred to above, p. 30, para. 63). Although the forfeiture made it permanently impossible to show the film anywhere in Austria, the Court considers that the means employed were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that therefore the national authorities did not exceed their margin of appreciation in this respect.', 'There has accordingly been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) as regards the forfeiture either.']",2,at,001-57897,0

Mr Jens Olaf Jersild, a Danish national, is a journalist and lives in Copenhagen. He was at the time of the events giving rise to the present case, and still is, employed by Danmarks Radio (Danish Broadcasting Corporation, which broadcasts not only radio but also television programmes), assigned to its Sunday News Magazine ( Søndagsavisen ). The latter is known as a serious television programme intended for a well-informed audience, dealing with a wide range of social and political issues, including xenophobia, immigration and refugees.', 'A. The Greenjackets item', '10. On 31 May 1985 the newspaper Information published an article describing the racist attitudes of members of a group of young people, calling themselves ""the Greenjackets"" ("" grønjakkerne ""), at Østerbro in Copenhagen. In the light of this article, the editors of the Sunday News Magazine decided to produce a documentary on the Greenjackets. Subsequently the applicant contacted representatives of the group, inviting three of them together with Mr Per Axholt, a social worker employed at the local youth centre, to take part in a television interview. During the interview, which was conducted by the applicant, the three Greenjackets made abusive and derogatory remarks about immigrants and ethnic groups in Denmark. It lasted between five and six hours, of which between two and two and a half hours were video-recorded. Danmarks Radio paid the interviewees fees in accordance with its usual practice.', '11. The applicant subsequently edited and cut the film of the interview down to a few minutes. On 21 July 1985 this was broadcast by Danmarks Radio as a part of the Sunday News Magazine. The programme consisted of a variety of items, for instance on the martial law in South Africa, on the debate on profit-sharing in Denmark and on the late German writer Heinrich Böll. The transcript of the Greenjackets item reads as follows [(I): TV presenter; (A): the applicant; (G): one or other of the Greenjackets ]:', '(I) ""In recent years, a great deal has been said about racism in Denmark. The papers are currently publishing stories about distrust and resentment directed against minorities. Who are the people who hate the minorities? Where do they come from? What is their mentality like? Mr Jens Olaf Jersild has visited a group of extremist youths at Østerbro in Copenhagen.', '(A) The flag on the wall is the flag of the Southern States from the American Civil War, but today it is also the symbol of racism, the symbol of the American movement, the Ku Klux Klan, and it shows what Lille Steen, Henrik and Nisse are.', 'Are you a racist?', '(G) Yes, that ’ s what I regard myself as. It ’ s good being a racist. We believe Denmark is for the Danes.', '(A) Henrik, Lille Steen and all the others are members of a group of young people who live in Studsgårdsgade, called STUDSEN, in Østerbro in Copenhagen. It is public housing, a lot of the inhabitants are unemployed and on social security; the crime rate is high. Some of the young people in this neighbourhood have already been involved in criminal activities and have already been convicted.', '(G) It was an ordinary armed robbery at a petrol station.', '(A) What did you do?', '(G) Nothing. I just ran into a petrol station with a ... gun and made them give me some money. Then I ran out again. That ’ s all.', '(A) What about you, what happened?', '(G) I don ’ t wish to discuss that further.', '(A) But, was it violence?', '(G) Yes.', '(A) You have just come out of ... you have been arrested, what were you arrested for?', '(G) Street violence.', '(A) What happened?', '(G) I had a little fight with the police together with some friends.', '(A) Does that happen often?', '(G) Yes, out here it does.', '(A) All in all, there are 20-25 young people from STUDSEN in the same group.', 'They meet not far away from the public housing area near some old houses which are to be torn down. They meet here to reaffirm among other things their racism, their hatred of immigrants and their support for the Ku Klux Klan.', '(G) The Ku Klux Klan, that ’ s something that comes from the States in the old days during - you know - the civil war and things like that, because the Northern States wanted that the niggers should be free human beings, man, they are not human beings, they are animals, right, it ’ s completely wrong, man, the things that happened. People should be allowed to keep slaves, I think so anyway.', '(A) Because blacks are not human beings?', '(G) No, you can also see that from their body structure, man, big flat noses, with cauliflower ears etc., man.

A nigger is not a human being, it ’ s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called.', '(A) Henrik is 19 years old and on welfare. He lives in a rented room in Studsgårdsgade. Henrik is one of the strongest supporters of the Klan, and he hates the foreign workers, ‘ Perkere ’ [a very derogatory word in Danish for immigrant workers].', '(G) They come up here, man, and sponge on our society. But we, we have enough problems in getting our social benefits, man, they just get it. Fuck, we can argue with those idiots up there at the social benefit office to get our money, man, they just get it, man, they are the first on the housing list, they get better flats than us, man, and some of our friends who have children, man, they are living in the worst slum, man, they can ’ t even get a shower in their flat, man, then those ‘ Perkere ’ -families, man, go up there with seven kids, man, and they just get an expensive flat, right there and then. They get everything paid, and things like that, that can ’ t be right, man, Denmark is for the Danes, right?', 'It is the fact that they are ‘ Perkere ’, that ’ s what we don ’ t like, right, and we don ’ t like their mentality - I mean they can damn well, I mean ... what ’ s it called ... I mean if they feel like speaking Russian in their homes, right, then it ’ s okay, but what we don ’ t like is when they walk around in those Zimbabwe-clothes and then speak this hula-hula language in the street, and if you ask them something or if you get into one of their taxis then they say: I don ’ t know where it is, you give directions right.', '(A) Is it not so that perhaps you are a bit envious that some of the ‘ Perkere ’ as you call them have their own shops, and cars, they can make ends ...', '(G) It ’ s drugs they are selling, man, half of the prison population in ‘ Vestre ’ are in there because of drugs, man, half of those in Vestre prison anyway, they are the people who are serving time for dealing drugs or something similar.', 'They are in there, all the ‘ Perkere ’, because of drugs, right. [That] must be enough, what ’ s it called, there should not be drugs here in this country, but if it really has to be smuggled in, I think we should do it ourselves, I mean, I think it ’ s unfair that those foreigners come up here to ... what ’ s it called ... make Denmark more drug dependent and things like that.', 'We have painted their doors and hoped that they would get fed up with it, so that they would soon leave, and jumped on their cars and thrown paint in their faces when they were lying in bed sleeping.', '(A) What was it you did with that paint - why paint?', '(G) Because it was white paint, I think that suited them well, that was the intended effect.', '(A) You threw paint through the windows of an immigrant family?', '(G) Yes.', '(A) What happened?', '(G) He just got it in his face, that ’ s all.

He has worked there for several years, but many give up a lot sooner because of the tough environment. Per Axholt feels that the reasons why the young people are persecuting the immigrants is that they are themselves powerless and disappointed.', 'What do you think they would say that they want, if you asked them?', '(P) Just what you and I want. Some control over their lives, work which may be considered decent and which they like, a reasonable economic situation, a reasonably functioning family, a wife or a husband and some children, a reasonable middle-class life such as you and I have.', '(A) They do many things which are sure to prevent them from getting it.', '(P) That is correct.', '(A) Why do you think they do this?', '(P) Because they have nothing better to do. They have been told over a long period that the means by which to achieve success is money. They won ’ t be able to get money legitimately, so often they try to obtain it through criminal activity. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes not, and that ’ s why we see a lot of young people in that situation go to prison, because it doesn ’ t work.', '---', '(A) How old were you when you started your criminal activities?', '(G) I don ’ t know, about 14 I guess.', '(A) What did you do?', '(G) The first time, I can ’ t remember, I don ’ t know, burglary.', '(A) Do you have what one might call a criminal career?', '(G) I don ’ t know if you can call it that.', '(A) You committed your first crime when you were 14.', '(G) Well, you can put it that way, I mean, if that is a criminal career. If you have been involved in crime since the age of 15 onwards, then I guess you can say I ’ ve had a criminal career.', '(A) Will you tell me about some of the things you have done?', '(G) No, not really. It ’ s been the same over and over again. There has been pinching of videos, where the ‘ Perkere ’ have been our customers, so they have money. If people want to be out here and have a nice time and be racists and drink beer, and have fun, then it ’ s quite obvious you don ’ t want to sit in the slammer.', '(A) But is the threat of imprisonment something that really deters people from doing something illegal?', '(G) No, it ’ s not prison, that doesn ’ t frighten people.', '(A) Is that why you hear stories about people from out here fighting with knives etc., night after night. Is the reason for this the fact that they are not afraid of the police getting hold of them?', '(G) Yes, nothing really comes of it, I mean, there are no bad consequences, so probably that ’ s why. For instance fights and stabbings and smashing up things ... If you really get into the joint it would be such a ridiculously small sentence, so it would be, I mean ... usually we are released the next day. Last time we caused some trouble over at the pub, they let us out the next morning. Nothing really comes of it. It doesn ’ t discourage us, but there were five of us, who just came out and then we had a celebration for the last guy, who came out yesterday, they probably don ’ t want to go in again for some time so they probably won ’ t commit big crimes again.', '(A) You would like to move back to Studsgårdsgade where you grew up, but we know for sure that it ’ s an environment with a high crime rate. Would you like your child to grow up like you?', '(G) No, and I don ’ t think she will. Firstly, because she is a girl, statistics show that the risk is not that high, I mean they probably don ’ t do it, but you don ’ t have to be a criminal because you live in an environment with a high crime rate. I just wouldn ’ t accept it, if she was mugging old women and stealing their handbags.', '(A) What if she was among those beating up the immigrants etc. What then?', '(G) That would be okay. I wouldn ’ t have anything against that.', '---', '(I) We will have to see if the mentality of this family changes in the next generation. Finally, we would like to say that groups of young people like this one in STUDSEN at Østerbro, have been formed elsewhere in Copenhagen .""', 'B. Proceedings in the City Court of Copenhagen', '12. Following the programme no complaints were made to the Radio Council, which had competence in such matters, or to Danmarks Radio but the Bishop of Ålborg complained to the Minister of Justice. After undertaking investigations the Public Prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the City Court of Copenhagen ( Københavns Byret ) against the three youths interviewed by the applicant, charging them with a violation of Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code ( straffeloven ) (see paragraph 19 below) for having made the statements cited below:', '""... the Northern States wanted that the niggers should be free human beings, man, they are not human beings, they are animals.""', '""Just take a picture of a gorilla, man, and then look at a nigger, it ’ s the same body structure and everything, man, flat forehead and all kinds of things.""', '""A nigger is not a human being, it ’ s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called.""', '""It is the fact that they are ‘ Perkere ’, that ’ s what we don ’ t like, right, and we don ’ t like their mentality ... what we don ’ t like is when they walk around in those Zimbabwe-clothes and then speak this hula-hula language in the street ...""', '""It ’ s drugs they are selling, man, half of the prison population in ‘ Vestre ’ are in there because of drugs ... they are the people who are serving time for dealing drugs ...""', '""They are in there, all the ‘ Perkere ’, because of drugs ...""', 'The applicant was charged, under Article 266 (b) in conjunction with Article 23 (see paragraph 19 below), with aiding and abetting the three youths; the same charge was brought against the head of the news section of Danmarks Radio, Mr Lasse Jensen.', '13. In the City Court counsel for the applicant and Mr Jensen called for their acquittal. He argued that the conduct of the applicant and Mr Jensen could in no way be compared to that of the other three defendants, with whose views they did not sympathise. They sought merely to provide a realistic picture of a social problem; in fact the programme only provoked resentment and aroused pity in respect of the three other defendants, who had exposed themselves to ridicule on their own terms. Accordingly, it was by no means the intention of Danmarks Radio to persuade others to subscribe to the same views as the Greenjackets, rather the contrary. Under the relevant law a distinction had to be drawn between the persons who made the statements and the programme editors, the latter enjoying a special freedom of expression. Having at that time a broadcasting monopoly, Danmarks Radio was under a duty to impart all opinions of public interest in a manner that reflected the speaker ’ s way of expressing himself. The public also had an interest in being informed of notoriously bad social attitudes, even those which were unpleasant. The programme was broadcast in the context of a public debate which had resulted in press comments, for instance in Information, and was simply an honest report on the realities of the youths in question. Counsel, referring inter alia to the above-mentioned article in Information, also pointed to the fact that no consistent prosecution policy had been followed in cases of this nature.', '14. On 24 April 1987 the City Court convicted the three youths, one of them for having stated that ""niggers"" and ""foreign workers"" were ""animals"", and two of them for their assertions in relation to drugs and"" Perkere "". The applicant was convicted of aiding and abetting them, as was Mr Jensen, in his capacity as programme controller; they were sentenced to pay day-fines ( dagsbøder ) totalling 1,000 and 2,000 Danish kroner, respectively, or alternatively to five days ’ imprisonment ( hæfte ).', 'As regards the applicant, the City Court found that, following the article in Information of 31 May 1985, he had visited the Greenjackets and after a conversation with Mr Axholt, amongst others, agreed that the three youths should participate in a television programme. The object of the programme had been to demonstrate the attitude of the Greenjackets to the racism at Østerbro, previously mentioned in the article in Information, and to show their social background. Accordingly, so the City Court held, the applicant had himself taken the initiative of making the television programme and, further, he had been well aware in advance that discriminatory statements of a racist nature were likely to be made during the interview. The interview had lasted several hours, during which beer, partly paid for by Danmarks Radio, was consumed. In this connection the applicant had encouraged the Greenjackets to express their racist views, which, in so far as they were broadcast on television, in itself constituted a breach of Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code. The statements were broadcast without any counterbalancing comments, after the recordings had been edited by the applicant. He was accordingly guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of Article 266 (b).', 'C. Proceedings in the High Court of Eastern Denmark', '15. The applicant and Mr Jensen, but not the three Greenjackets, appealed against the City Court ’ s judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark ( Østre Landsret ). They essentially reiterated the submissions made before the City Court and, in addition, the applicant explained that, although he had suspected that the Greenjackets ’ statements were punishable, he had refrained from omitting these from the programme, considering it crucial to show their actual attitude. He assumed that they were aware that they might incur criminal liability by making the statements and had therefore not warned them of this fact.', '16. By judgment of 16 June 1988 the High Court, by five votes to one, dismissed the appeal.', 'The dissenting member was of the view that, although the statements by the Greenjackets constituted offences under Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code, the applicant and Mr Jensen had not transgressed the bounds of the freedom of speech to be enjoyed by television and other media, since the object of the programme was to inform about and animate public discussion on the particular racist attitudes and social background of the youth group in question.', 'D. Proceedings in the Supreme Court', '17. With leave the applicant and Mr Jensen appealed from the High Court judgment to the Supreme Court ( Højesteret ), which by four votes to one dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 13 February 1989. The majority held:', '""The defendants have caused the publication of the racist statements made by a narrow circle of persons and thereby made those persons liable to punishment and have thus, as held by the City Court and the High Court, violated Article 266 (b) in conjunction with Article 23 of the Penal Code. [We] do not find that an acquittal of the defendants could be justified on the ground of freedom of expression in matters of public interest as opposed to the interest in the protection against racial discrimination. [We] therefore vote in favour of confirming the judgment [appealed from].""', 'Justice Pontoppidan stated in his dissent:', '""The object of the programme was to contribute to information on an issue - the attitude towards foreigners - which was the subject of extensive and sometimes emotional public debate. The programme must be presumed to have given a clear picture of the Greenjackets ’ views, of which the public was thus given an opportunity to be informed and form its own opinion. In view of the nature of these views, any counterbalancing during or immediately before or after would not have served a useful purpose. Although it concerned a relatively small group of people holding extreme views, the programme had a fair degree of news and information value. The fact that the defendants took the initiative to disseminate such views is not of paramount importance for the assessment of their conduct. In these circumstances and irrespective of the fact that the statements rightly have been found to be in violation of Article 266 (b), I question the advisability of finding the defendants guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of this provision. I therefore vote in favour of the defendants ’ acquittal.""', '18. When the Supreme Court has rendered judgment in a case raising important issues of principle it is customary that a member of the majority publishes a detailed and authoritative statement of the reasons for the judgment. In keeping with this custom, Justice Hermann on 20 January 1990 published such a statement in the Weekly Law Journal ( Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen, 1989, p. 399).', 'As regards the conviction of the applicant and Mr Jensen, the majority had attached importance to the fact that they had caused the racist statements to be made public. The applicant ’ s item had not been a direct report on a meeting. He had himself contacted the three youths and caused them to make assertions such as those previously made in Information, which he knew of and probably expected them to repeat. He had himself cut the recording of the interview, lasting several hours, down to a few minutes containing the crude comments. The statements, which would hardly have been punishable under Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code had they not been made to a wide circle ("" videre kreds "") of people, became clearly punishable as they were broadcast on television on the applicant ’ s initiative and with Mr Jensen ’ s approval. It was therefore beyond doubt that they had aided and abetted the dissemination of the statements.', 'Acquitting the applicant and Mr Jensen could only be justified by reasons clearly outweighing the wrongfulness of their actions. In this connection, the interest in protecting those grossly insulted by the statements had to be weighed up against that of informing the public of the statements. Whilst it is desirable to allow the press the best possible conditions for reporting on society, press freedom cannot be unlimited since freedom of expression is coupled with responsibilities.', 'In striking a balance between the various interests involved, the majority had regard to the fact that the statements, which were brought to a wide circle of people, consisted of series of inarticulate, defamatory remarks and insults spoken by members of an insignificant group whose opinions could hardly be of interest to many people. Their news or information value was not such as to justify their dissemination and therefore did not warrant acquitting the defendants. This did not mean that extremist views could not be reported in the press, but such reports must be carried out in a more balanced and comprehensive manner than was the case in the television programme in question. Direct reports from meetings which were a matter of public interest should also be permitted.', 'The minority, on the other hand, considered that the right to information overrode the interests protected by Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code.', 'Finally, Justice Hermann noted that the compatibility of the impugned measures with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention was not raised during the trial.', 'III. INSTRUMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS', '21. Provisions relating to the prohibition of racial discrimination and the prevention of propaganda of racist views and ideas are to be found in a number of international instruments, for example the 1945 United Nations Charter (paragraph 2 of the Preamble, Articles 1 para. 3, 13 para. 1 (b), 55 (c) and 76 (c)), the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 1, 2 and 7) and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Articles 2 para. 1, 20 para. 2 and 26). The most directly relevant treaty is the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (""the UN Convention""), which has been ratified by a large majority of the Contracting States to the European Convention, including Denmark (9 December 1971). Articles 4 and 5 of that Convention provide:', 'Article 4', '""States Parties condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in Article 5 of this Convention, inter alia:', '(a) shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;', '...""', 'Article 5', '""In compliance with the fundamental obligation laid down in ... this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights:', '...', '(d) ...', 'viii. the right to freedom of opinion and expression;', '...""', 'The effects of the ""due regard"" clause in Article 4 has given rise to differing interpretations and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (""the UN Committee"" - set up to supervise the implementation of the UN Convention) was divided in its comments on the applicant ’ s conviction. The present case had been presented by the Danish Government in a report to the UN Committee. Whilst some members welcomed it as ""the clearest statement yet, in any country, that the right to protection against racial discrimination took precedence over the right to freedom of expression"", other members considered that ""in such cases the facts needed to be considered in relation to both rights"" (Report of the Committee to the General Assembly, Official Records, Forty-Fifth Session, Supplement No. 18 (A/45/18), p. 21, para. 56).']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The Penal Code', '19. At the relevant time Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code provided:', '""Any person who, publicly or with the intention of disseminating it to a wide circle ("" videre kreds "") of people, makes a statement, or other communication, threatening, insulting or degrading a group of persons on account of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin or belief shall be liable to a fine or to simple detention or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.""', 'Article 23, paragraph 1, reads:', '""A provision establishing a criminal offence shall apply to any person who has assisted the commission of the offence by instigation, advice or action. The punishment may be reduced if the person in question only intended to give assistance of minor importance or to strengthen an intent already resolved or if the offence has not been completed or an intended assistance failed.""', 'B. The 1991 Media Liability Act', '20. The 1991 Media Liability Act ( Medieansvarsloven, 1991:348), which entered into force on 1 January 1992, that is after the events giving rise to the present case, lays down rules inter alia on criminal liability in respect of television broadcasts. Section 18 provides:', '""A person making a statement during a non-direct broadcast ( forskudt udsendelse ) shall be responsible for the statement under general statutory provisions, unless:', '(1) the identity of the person concerned does not appear from the broadcast; or', '(2) [that person] has not consented to the statement being broadcast; or', '(3) [he or she] has been promised that [he or she] may take part [in the broadcast] without [his or her] identity being disclosed and reasonable precautions have been taken to this effect.', 'In the situations described in paragraph 1, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) above, the editor is responsible for the contents of the statements even where a violation of the law has occurred without intent or negligence on his part ...""', 'Pursuant to section 22:', '""A person who reads out or in any other manner conveys a text or statement, is not responsible for the contents of that text or statement.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '22. In his application (no. 15890/89) of 25 July 1989 to the Commission the applicant complained that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', '23. On 8 September 1992 the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 8 July 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (by twelve votes to four).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT', '24. At the hearing on 20 April 1994 the Government invited the Court to hold that, as submitted in their memorial, there had been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)', '25. The applicant maintained that his conviction and sentence for having aided and abetted the dissemination of racist remarks violated his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which reads:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '26. The Government contested this contention whereas the Commission upheld it.', '27. It is common ground that the measures giving rise to the applicant ’ s case constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression.', 'It is moreover undisputed that this interference was ""prescribed by law"", the applicant ’ s conviction being based on Articles 266 (b) and 23 (1) of the Penal Code. In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention. The Government ’ s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above). In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention.', 'Finally it is uncontested that the interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely the ""protection of the reputation or rights of others"".', 'The only point in dispute is whether the measures were ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '28. The applicant and the Commission were of the view that, notwithstanding Denmark ’ s obligations as a Party to the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above), a fair balance had to be struck between the ""protection of the reputation or rights of others"" and the applicant ’ s right to impart information. According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention"". The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that ""[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred"" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In the applicant ’ s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers ’ Deputies on 31 October 1968).', 'The applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views. The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia. The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure. The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths. Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the ""reputation or rights of others"". The interests in protecting the latter were therefore outweighed by those of protecting the applicant ’ s freedom of expression.', 'In addition the applicant alleged that had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the relevant time he would not have faced prosecution since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable. This undermined the Government ’ s argument that his conviction was required by the UN Convention and ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10).', '29. The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal. Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast. Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme. It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value. No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints, since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining. The applicant had thus failed to fulfil the ""duties and responsibilities"" incumbent on him as a television journalist. The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences and was therefore not likely to deter any journalist from contributing to public discussion on racism and xenophobia; it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated.', 'The Government moreover disputed that the matter would have been dealt with differently had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the material time. The rule that only the author of a punishable statement may incur liability was subject to exceptions (see paragraph 20 above); how the applicant ’ s case would have been considered under the 1991 Act was purely a matter of speculation.', 'The Government stressed that at all three levels the Danish courts, which were in principle better placed than the European Court to evaluate the effects of the programme, had carried out a careful balancing exercise of all the interests involved. The review effected by those courts had been similar to that carried out under Article 10 (art. 10); their decisions fell within the margin of appreciation to be left to the national authorities and corresponded to a pressing social need.', '30. The Court would emphasise at the outset that it is particularly conscious of the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time. Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965. Consequently, the object and purpose pursued by the UN Convention are of great weight in determining whether the applicant ’ s conviction, which - as the Government have stressed - was based on a provision enacted in order to ensure Denmark ’ s compliance with the UN Convention, was ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'In the second place, Denmark ’ s obligations under Article 10 (art. 10) must be interpreted, to the extent possible, so as to be reconcilable with its obligations under the UN Convention. In this respect it is not for the Court to interpret the ""due regard"" clause in Article 4 of the UN Convention, which is open to various constructions. The Court is however of the opinion that its interpretation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention in the present case is compatible with Denmark ’ s obligations under the UN Convention.', '31. A significant feature of the present case is that the applicant did not make the objectionable statements himself but assisted in their dissemination in his capacity of television journalist responsible for a news programme of Danmarks Radio (see paragraphs 9 to 11 above). In assessing whether his conviction and sentence were ""necessary"", the Court will therefore have regard to the principles established in its case-law relating to the role of the press (as summarised in for instance the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).', 'The Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (ibid.). Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (ibid.). Although formulated primarily with regard to the print media, these principles doubtless apply also to the audiovisual media.', 'In considering the ""duties and responsibilities"" of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor and it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, Commission ’ s admissibility decision of 16 April 1991, application no. 15404/89, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p. 262). The audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart.', 'At the same time, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question. It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. In this context the Court recalls that Article 10 (art. 10) protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57).', 'The Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59). In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 32-33, para. 29).', 'The Court ’ s assessment will have regard to the manner in which the Greenjackets feature was prepared, its contents, the context in which it was broadcast and the purpose of the programme. Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court ’ s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas.', '32. The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements. He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions. Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above).', 'The Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', '33. On the other hand, as to the contents of the Greenjackets item, it should be noted that the TV presenter ’ s introduction started by a reference to recent public discussion and press comments on racism in Denmark, thus inviting the viewer to see the programme in that context. He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background. There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim. Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas. On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern.', 'The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above). However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members ’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it.', '34. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above).', 'The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed. Both the TV presenter ’ s introduction and the applicant ’ s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of ""a group of extremist youths"" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them. The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs. It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets.', 'Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race. However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist ’ s discretion as to the form of expression used, the Court does not consider the absence of such precautionary reminders to be relevant.', '35. News reporting based on interviews, whether edited or not, constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (see, for instance, the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59). The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so. In this regard the Court does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the limited nature of the fine is relevant; what matters is that the journalist was convicted.', 'There can be no doubt that the remarks in respect of which the Greenjackets were convicted (see paragraph 14 above) were more than insulting to members of the targeted groups and did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) (see, for instance, the Commission ’ s admissibility decisions in Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands, applications nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, DR 18, p. 187; and Künen v. Germany, application no. 12194/86, DR 56, p. 205). However, even having regard to the manner in which the applicant prepared the Greenjackets item (see paragraph 32 above), it has not been shown that, considered as a whole, the feature was such as to justify also his conviction of, and punishment for, a criminal offence under the Penal Code.', '36. It is moreover undisputed that the purpose of the applicant in compiling the broadcast in question was not racist. Although he relied on this in the domestic proceedings, it does not appear from the reasoning in the relevant judgments that they took such a factor into account (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 above).', '37. Having regard to the foregoing, the reasons adduced in support of the applicant ’ s conviction and sentence were not sufficient to establish convincingly that the interference thereby occasioned with the enjoyment of his right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society""; in particular the means employed were disproportionate to the aim of protecting ""the reputation or rights of others"". Accordingly the measures gave rise to a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)', '38. Mr Jersild sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, according to which:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', '39. The Government accepted parts of his claim. The Commission offered no comments.', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '40. The applicant claimed 1,000 kroner in respect of the fine imposed upon him, to be reimbursed by him to Danmarks Radio which had provisionally paid the fine for him.', '41. The Government did not object and the Court finds that the amount should be awarded.', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '42. The applicant requested 20,000 kroner in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. He maintained that his professional reputation had been prejudiced and that he had felt distress as a result of his conviction.', '43. The Court observes that the applicant still works with the Sunday News Magazine at Danmarks Radio and that his employer has supported him throughout the proceedings, inter alia by paying the fine (see paragraphs 9 and 40 above) and legal fees (see paragraph 44 below). It agrees with the Government that the finding of a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) constitutes in itself adequate just satisfaction in this respect.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '44. The applicant claimed in respect of costs and expenses:', '(a) 45,000 kroner for work done in the domestic proceedings by his lawyer, Mr J. Stockholm;', '(b) by way of legal fees incurred in the Strasbourg proceedings, 13,126.80 kroner for Mrs Johannessen, 6,900 pounds sterling for Mr Boyle and 50,000 kroner (exclusive 25% value-added tax) for Mr Trier;', '(c) 20,169.20 kroner to cover costs of translation, interpretation and an expert opinion;', '(d) 25,080 kroner, 965.40 pounds and 4,075 French francs in travel and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with the hearings before the Commission and Court, as well as miscellaneous expenses.', 'Parts of the above costs and expenses had been provisionally disbursed by Danmarks Radio.', '45. The Government did not object to the above claims. The Court considers that the applicant is entitled to recover the sums in their entirety. They should be increased by any value-added taxes that may be chargeable.']",2,dk,001-57891,1

The first applicant, a Vienna-based association, published a monthly magazine aimed at the soldiers serving in the Austrian army and entitled der Igel (""The Hedgehog""). It contained information and articles - often of a critical nature - on military life.', '8. On 27 July 1987 the association requested the Federal Minister for Defence ( Bundesminister für Landesverteidigung ) to have der Igel distributed in the barracks in the same way as the only other two military magazines published by private associations, Miliz-Impuls and Visier. The army had adopted the practice of sending these magazines out, alternately and at its own expense, with the official information bulletin distributed to all conscripts ( Miliz -Information).', 'The minister did not reply to this request. When questioned by members of parliament, he stated in a letter of 10 May 1989 that he would not authorise the distribution of der Igel in barracks. In his view, section 46 para. 3 of the Armed Forces Act ( Wehrgesetz, see paragraph 18 below) conferred on all armed forces personnel the right to receive without any restriction, through sources accessible to the public, information on political events. However, on military premises the only publications that could be supplied were those which identified at least to some extent with the constitutional duties of the army, did not damage its reputation and did not lend column space to political parties. Even critical magazines such as the journal Hallo of the trade union youth organisation would not be banned if they respected these conditions. Der Igel, on the other hand, did not comply with them. The minister derived authority for his decision in this matter from Article 79 of the Constitution ( Bundesverfassungsgesetz ) and sections 44 para. 1 and 46 of the Armed Forces Act, Article 116 of the Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch ) and Regulation 3 para. 1 of the General Army Regulations ( Allgemeine Dienstvorschriften für das Bundesheer, see paragraphs 17-20 below).', 'B. Second applicant', '9. The second applicant, a member of the VDSÖ, began his national service on 1 July 1987 at the Schwarzenberg barracks in Salzbourg. On 29 July, on the occasion of his taking the oath, he made a protest directed against the President of the Republic. Over the following months, he lodged several complaints, published with twenty-one of his fellow conscripts an open letter criticising the number of fatigue duties to which he was assigned and circulated a petition in support of a conscientious objector.', 'On 1, 9 and 22 July he was personally informed of the content of the military law applicable to his situation.', '10. On 29 December 1987, while distributing issue no. 3/87 of der Igel in the barracks, he was ordered by an officer to cease.', 'In its editorial, the issue in question mentioned, as being one of the aims of the VDSÖ, co-operation between conscripts and the cadres on the basis of their joint interests and of mutual respect. Some articles adopted a critical stance; they dealt with, among other things, military training, the proceedings resulting from a complaint lodged by Mr Gubi and the principles governing national service. The other articles discussed various contributions that had appeared in the press, the congress of the trade union youth movement, the aims and the activities of the VDSÖ and the complaint of a conscript whose pay had been reduced following alleged loss of equipment.', '11. On 12 January 1988 another officer informed Mr Gubi of the content of the circulars of 1975 and 1987 and of the regulations of the Schwarzenberg barracks, as amended on 4 January 1988, which prohibited any distribution or despatching within the barracks of publications without the authorisation of the commanding officer (see paragraph 20 below).', '12. On 22 January 1988 Mr Gubi complained about this ban and about the order of 29 December 1987 (see paragraph 10 above) to the Military Complaints Board ( Beschwerdekommission in militärischen Angelegenheiten ) at the Federal Ministry of Defence.', 'On 7 April the Complaints Division ( Beschwerdeabteilung ) at the ministry rejected the applicant ’ s complaint, in accordance with the Complaints Board ’ s recommendation. In its view, the contested order was validly based on a 1987 circular of the Second Army Corps ( Korpskommando II), containing instructions regarding the distribution of printed matter, which were themselves based on Article 5 of the 1867 Basic Law ( Staatsgrundgesetz über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger ), Regulation 19 of the General Army Regulations and section 13 of the Armed Forces Act (see paragraphs 15 and 18-20 below). The first of those provisions affords the same protection to the property of public-law legal persons as that guaranteed to the property of private individuals; accordingly, the Schwarzenberg barracks were to be regarded as the property of the Federal State, whose rights were exercised by the commanding officer.', 'The freedom of expression secured under Article 13 of the 1867 Basic Law was subject to ""statutory limits"" ( gesetzliche Schranken ) such as those which stemmed from the duty of discretion and obedience laid down in sections 17 and 44 of the Armed Forces Act and derived from the very nature of this special relationship of subordination ( besonderes Gewaltverhältnis ). The contested measures had therefore in no way interfered with the freedom in question.', '13. Mr Gubi then applied to the Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ). On 26 September it declined to entertain his appeal on the ground that it did not raise genuine constitutional issues and had insufficient prospects of success.', '14. The same day, however, the Constitutional Court quashed the decision of 15 February 1988 whereby the commanding officer of battalion no. 3 had confirmed the three days ’ custody imposed on the applicant as a disciplinary penalty for having distributed der Igel in the barracks. It found that the provisions which Mr Gubi was accused of infringing, the 1975 and 1987 circulars (see paragraph 20 below), were not binding on him but on the military authorities. This was not the case in regard to the relevant provisions of the Schwarzenberg barracks regulations, but these rules had been introduced on 4 January 1988 and were therefore not yet in force at the material time.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. Rights under the Basic Law', '15. Article 5 of the Basic Law of 21 December 1867 on the general rights of citizens protects property.', '16. Article 13 provides as follows:', '""Subject to statutory limits, everyone has the right to express freely his opinion orally, in writing, in the printed word or through graphic expression. The Press may not be censored or restricted by a system of licences ...""', 'B. Military law', '17. Article 79 of the Federal Constitution describes the general duties of the Austrian armed forces.', '18. At the material time the rights and obligations of military personnel were governed by sections 44 to 46 of the 1978 Armed Forces Act. According to this statute, soldiers are under a duty to support the army in the performance of its tasks and to refrain from doing anything which could damage its reputation (section 44 para. 1). They have the right to submit requests and complaints and to file appeals (section 44 para. 4). They enjoy the same political rights as civilians (section 46 para. 2). However, the army must not be involved in any political activity and may not be used for political ends (section 46 para. 1). Consequently, such activities while on duty and on military premises are prohibited, with the exception of those which consist in obtaining information as an individual on political events through sources accessible to the public (section 46 para. 3).', '19. The General Army Regulations, issued by the Federal Ministry of Defence, set out the obligations attaching to national service. They provide, inter alia, that servicemen must always be ready to fulfil their duties in the best possible way and must refrain from doing anything which could damage the reputation of the army and undermine the confidence of the population in the defence of the country (Regulation 3 para. 1). Servicemen have a special relationship of subordination in regard to the Austrian Republic. That relationship requires of them, in addition to the defence of the democratic institutions, discipline, comradeship, obedience, vigilance, courage and discretion (Regulation 3 para. 2). Under Regulation 19 para. 2 barracks ’ commanders are bound to take all the measures necessary to maintain order and military security in the premises in question; to this end they are under a duty to issue rules ( Kasernordnung ) governing inter alia access to the barracks (Regulation 19 para. 3).', '20. By a circular of the Federal Ministry of Defence of 14 March 1975 the army general staff ( Armeekommando ) instructed commanding officers to take preventive measures in respect of publications denigrating the army (negatives wehrpolitisches Gedankengut ). They were, among other things, to ban their distribution and posting up in military areas.', 'A circular from the general staff of the Second Army Corps) of 17 December 1987 instructed the same officers to insert in the barracks rules a prohibition on the distribution or posting up without the commanding officer ’ s authorisation of any non-official publication. The Schwarzenberg barracks rules were amended accordingly on 4 January 1988.', 'C. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court', '21. The Constitutional Court examines, on an application ( Beschwerde ), whether an administrative measure ( Bescheid ) has infringed a right guaranteed to the applicant by the Constitution, or whether it has applied a decree ( Verordnung ) that is contrary to the law, an Act contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law (Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '22. The VDSÖ and Mr Gubi applied to the Commission on 12 June 1989. Relying on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, they complained of the prohibition imposed in respect of the magazine der Igel in Austrian barracks and, the second applicant, of the order of 29 December 1987 requiring him to cease distributing issue no. 3/87 in the Schwarzenberg barracks. They also maintained that they had not had an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 (art. 13) and that they had been victims of discrimination on political grounds in breach of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10).', '23. The Commission declared the application (no. 15153/89) admissible on 6 July 1992. In its report of 30 June 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31) it expressed the following opinion:', '(a) as regards the first applicant:', '( i ) that there had been a violation of Articles 10 and 13 (art. 10, art. 13) (twelve votes to nine);', '(ii) that no separate question arose under Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) (unanimously);', '(b) as regards the second applicant:', '( i ) that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (twelve votes to nine) but not of Article 13 (art. 13) (unanimously);', '(ii) that no separate question arose under Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) (unanimously).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [*].', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', 'A. First applicant', '24. The first applicant complained of the Minister for Defence ’ s refusal to add der Igel to the list of periodicals distributed by the Austrian army. It considered that this constituted a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, according to which:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '25. It was the Government ’ s contention that the VDSÖ was in no way to be confused with those of its members who were serving in the armed forces at the material time. The minister had therefore been justified in regarding it as a third party and in exercising one of the rights that the Civil Code conferred on the Federal State as the proprietor of the barracks, namely that of deciding freely the nature of the services to be provided on those premises and of choosing which providers of such services should be solicited in that connection, without having to furnish an explanation to the latter.', 'The applicant association had asked that its magazine should be distributed by the army in the same way as two other non-official periodicals. In fact the service that it was requesting was based exclusively on private-law arrangements, arrangements which could in any event not be demanded as of right by the publishers concerned. The army authorities could not be expected to help distribute all the magazines that were submitted to them. In short, the minister had exercised a discretionary power and had not infringed a right, no such right being vested in the applicant association.', '26. In the light of the different arguments adduced, the Court must first consider whether there was an interference with the exercise by the VDSÖ of its right to impart information and ideas.', '1. Whether there was an interference', '27. As the Court has consistently held, the responsibility of a Contracting State is engaged if a violation of one of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention is the result of non-observance by that State of its obligation under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure those rights and freedoms in its domestic law to everyone within its jurisdiction (see, as the most recent authority, the Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1993, Series A no. 247-C, p. 57, para. 26).', 'In the present case the authorities effected themselves and at their own expense the distribution on a regular basis of military periodicals published by various associations, by sending them out with their official publications. Whatever the legal status of this arrangement, such a practice was bound to have an influence on the level of information imparted to the members of the armed forces and, accordingly, engaged the responsibility of the respondent State under Article 10 (art. 10). Freedom of expression applies to servicemen just as it does to other persons within the jurisdiction of the Contracting States (see, as the most recent authority, the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 252, p. 17, para. 39).', 'The Court notes further that, according to the case file, of all the periodicals for servicemen, only der Igel was not allowed access to this type of distribution (see paragraph 8 above). The VDSÖ could therefore reasonably claim that this situation should be remedied. It follows that the Minister for Defence ’ s rejection of its request was an interference with the exercise of its right to impart information and ideas.', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '28. The interference in issue infringed Article 10 (art. 10) if it was not ""prescribed by law"", if it did not pursue one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article (art. 10-2) or if it was not ""necessary in a democratic society"" in order to attain such aims.', '(a) Was the interference ""prescribed by law""?', '29. According to the applicant association, none of the provisions of military law on which the Minister for Defence might have relied could be regarded as ""law"" within the meaning of the Convention. This was true in the first place of sections 44 to 46 of the Armed Forces Act and Regulation 3 of the General Army Regulations, the very vague wording of which opened the way to arbitrariness. This was also the case in regard to the 1975 and the 1987 circulars, which had not, moreover, been accessible to the VDSÖ.', '30. The Government pointed out that, far from having adopted an administrative measure, the minister had merely refused to give a favourable reply to the applicant association ’ s request. In so far as was necessary, sufficient basis for his decision was to be found in the Civil Code and that basis satisfied Article 10 (art. 10) in this respect. The provisions of military law cited, in particular the 1975 circular, had at most served as a guide for the minister ’ s decision.', '31. The Court observes that although those provisions could not strictly constitute the legal basis of the minister ’ s action, as the minister did not take a formal decision, he nevertheless followed them in this instance. This is clear in particular from his reply to a parliamentary question (see paragraph 8 above). It is accordingly necessary to ascertain whether they qualified as ""law"".', 'The Court acknowledges that the provisions in question were formulated in general terms. It should however be recalled that the level of precision required of domestic legislation - which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality - depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument considered, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35-36, para. 25).', 'As far as military discipline is concerned, it would scarcely be possible to draw up rules describing different types of conduct in detail. It may therefore be necessary for the authorities to formulate such rules more broadly. The relevant provisions must, however, afford sufficient protection against arbitrariness and make it possible to foresee the consequences of their application.', 'In the Court ’ s view, the provisions in question, in particular the circular of 14 March 1975, provided sufficient legal basis for the refusal of the VDSÖ ’ s request. The first applicant had among its members servicemen who had access to these rules and it could therefore have been expected to be aware of the possibility that the minister might regard himself as bound to refer to them in relation to it. In conclusion, the interference in issue was ""prescribed by law"".', '(b) Did the interference pursue a legitimate aim?', '32. The impugned decision was evidently taken with a view to preserving order in the armed forces, a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 41, para. 98).', '(c) Was the interference ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '33. The VDSÖ denied that the refusal of its request had been necessary. It had been motivated solely by the desire to prevent a current of opinion regarded by the authorities as hostile to the army from being spread among the troops by the distribution of der Igel. Yet, the applicant association maintained, the Government were gradually implementing most of the reforms proposed by the magazine, such as the reduction of curfew restrictions, the introduction of a five-day week, pay increases and free public transport. The journal could not therefore be seen as a genuine threat.', '34. The Commission in substance accepted the first applicant ’ s view. It noted that der Igel contained no incitement to violence, to disobedience or to break the rules; at the very most it provided information on complaints and appeals procedures.', '35. According to the Government, the magazine sought to undermine the effectiveness of the army and of the country ’ s system of defence. Its distribution had been particularly undesirable because at the material time, when the cold war had still been in progress, there had been a certain amount of friction in the Schwarzenberg barracks. This situation, which was comparable to that found to exist in the case of Engel and Others (cited above, p. 42, para. 101), had arisen because of unrest among the servicemen as a result of various deliberately provocative actions (see paragraph 9 above), carried out by Mr Gubi, an active member of the VDSÖ.', 'Confronted with this situation, the Minister for Defence had even shown restraint as he had merely refused to allow the army to assist in the distribution of der Igel. This measure had been necessary in order to maintain discipline, but it had not prevented the applicant association from making the publication available to the soldiers through any other means. They could for instance receive it through the post and no restrictions were placed on their freedom to read it in the barracks. In short, the authorities had not overstepped their margin of appreciation, which was necessarily wider in this area because they alone were in a position to assess with full knowledge of all the circumstances, in a given situation, the specific duties and responsibilities of members of the armed forces.', '36. The Court reiterates that freedom of expression is also applicable to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that offend, shock or disturb the State or any section of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"" (see, inter alia, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 59, and the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 22, para. 42).', 'The same is true when the persons concerned are servicemen, because Article 10 (art. 10) applies to them just as it does to other persons within the jurisdiction of the Contracting States. However, the proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent servicemen from undermining military discipline, for example by writings (see the Engel and Others judgment, cited above, p. 41, para. 100, and the Hadjianastassiou judgment, cited above, p. 17, para. 39).', '37. The Court observes that at the material time the army distributed free of charge in all the country ’ s barracks its own publications and those of private associations of soldiers. It appears that only der Igel was denied this facility, which undoubtedly reduced considerably its chances of increasing its readership among service personnel. The fact that the VDSÖ retained the possibility of sending its journal to subscribers could not offset such a handicap. It could therefore only have been justified by imperative necessities since exceptions to the freedom of expression must be interpreted narrowly (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 41, para. 65).', '38. The Government sought support for their argument from the content of der Igel. The periodical, which was critical and satirical, had represented a threat to discipline and to the effectiveness of the army.', 'It is the Court ’ s opinion that such an assertion must be illustrated and substantiated by specific examples. None of the issues of der Igel submitted in evidence recommend disobedience or violence, or even question the usefulness of the army. Admittedly, most of the issues set out complaints, put forward proposals for reforms or encourage the readers to institute legal complaints or appeals proceedings. However, despite their often polemical tenor, it does not appear that they overstepped the bounds of what is permissible in the context of a mere discussion of ideas, which must be tolerated in the army of a democratic State just as it must be in the society that such an army serves.', '39. The Government also cited friction in the Schwarzenberg barracks, for which, they claimed, the publications of the applicant association and Mr Gubi ’ s activities were essentially responsible (see paragraph 9 above). This situation had led to a large number of complaints from the conscripts.', 'In the Court ’ s view, this situation, peculiar to a single barracks, was not sufficiently serious to justify a decision whose effects extended to all the military premises on the national territory. On this point the facts may be distinguished from the Engel and Others case. In that case the banned journal had been distributed solely in the place were the unrest cited by the authorities had occurred (see the above-mentioned judgment, p. 18, para. 43).', '40. In conclusion, the refusal by the Minister for Defence to include der Igel among the magazines distributed by the army was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. It follows that the first applicant was the victim of a violation of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'B. Second applicant', '41. Mr Gubi likewise claimed to have been the victim of a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) inasmuch as he had been prohibited from distributing issue no. 3/87 of der Igel (see paragraph 10 above).', '1. Whether there was an interference', '42. It is not in dispute that there was an interference with the exercise by Mr Gubi of his right to impart information and ideas.', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '43. It must therefore be determined whether the interference was ""prescribed by law"", whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and whether it was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in order to attain such aims.', '(a) Was the interference ""prescribed by law""?', '44. The applicant complained that there had been no legal basis for the order of 29 December 1987 requiring him to cease distributing der Igel. Neither the 1975 and 1987 circulars nor the regulations of the Schwarzenberg barracks could be regarded as ""law"" within the meaning of the Convention; they had not been published in the Official Gazette and their wording lacked sufficient precision. Only the barracks regulations contained a relevant provision, but it had been inserted with effect from 4 January 1988, in other words after the events giving rise to this case.', '45. The Government contended that the impugned measure had been based on sections 44 para. 1 and 46 of the Armed Forces Act, the requirements of which were set out in greater detail in Regulations 3 and 19 of the General Army Regulations and in the different barracks regulations. Indeed Mr Gubi had been personally informed of their content and how they applied in practice on 1, 9 and 22 July 1987 (see paragraph 9 above).', '46. On the question of the wording of these provisions, the Court refers to its reasoning in paragraph 31 above. Having regard in particular to the information given on the rules in force (see paragraph 9 above), the Court takes the view that, if need be having sought appropriate advice, the applicant was in a position to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the possibility of such a ban being imposed on him (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times (no. 1) judgment, cited above, p. 31, para. 49, and the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 27, para. 60).', '(b) Did the interference pursue a legitimate aim?', '47. The Court considers that the contested measure served, like the refusal complained of by the first applicant, to maintain order in the armed forces (see paragraph 32 above).', '(c) Was the interference ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '48. The Government explained the order in issue by referring to Mr Gubi ’ s conduct. Not only had he, when taking the oath, made a protest directed at the President of the Republic, he had also lodged several complaints and circulated a petition and an open letter (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant had thus borne a large share of the responsibility for the friction existing at the time in his barracks. He was in addition a member of the Austrian communist party, whose manifesto called for the abolition of the army. By ordering him to cease distributing der Igel, the officer in question had sought to prevent him from destabilising his fellow soldiers even further.', '49. The Court refers in the first instance to its reasoning at paragraphs 36 and 37 above. It shares the Government ’ s opinion that the particular incident must be viewed in its general context. This approach does not, however, remove the necessity of first examining the content of the publication in issue. Like the Commission, the Court notes that issue no. 3/87 of der Igel was essentially devoted to articles on the conditions of national service (see paragraph 10 above). These articles were written in a critical or even satirical style and were quick to make demands or put forward proposals for reform, yet they did not call into question the duty of obedience or the purpose of service in the armed forces. Accordingly the magazine could scarcely be seen as a serious threat to military discipline. It follows that the measure in question was disproportionate to the aim pursued and infringed Article 10 (art. 10).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13) OF THE CONVENTION', 'A. First applicant', '50. The VDSÖ complained in addition that no effective remedy had been available to it in Austria in respect of its grievance under Article 10 (art. 10). It relied on Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention, which provides:', '""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.""', '51. The Commission in substance subscribed to this view.', '52. The Government denied in the first place that the applicant association ’ s complaints were ""arguable"" for the purposes of the Convention. In the alternative, they contended that the association could have submitted its request to have der Igel distributed to the civil courts by means of an action for performance ( Leistungsklage ), an action for an order requiring the defendant to permit something to be done ( Duldungsklage ), or even an action for a declaration ( Feststellungsklage ).', '53. In the light of the conclusion at paragraph 40 above, the requirement that the complaint be ""arguable"" is satisfied in respect of the submission in question (see, inter alia, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, para. 52).', 'As regards the possible remedies cited by the Government, they have not put forward any example showing their application in a case similar to the present one. They have therefore failed to show that such remedies would have been effective.', 'It follows that the first applicant has been the victim of a violation of Article 13 (art. 13).', 'B. Second applicant', '54. Mr Gubi likewise complained of a breach of Article 13 (art. 13). In the circumstances of the present case, neither the Complaints Division nor the Constitutional Court could be regarded as a ""national authority"" within the meaning of that provision. The Complaints Division was under the authority of the Ministry of Defence and did not therefore afford the necessary guarantees of independence; the Constitutional Court had not examined the merits of the applicant ’ s complaint.', '55. Like the Commission and the Government, the Court notes that, under Article 144 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court is competent to hear complaints of servicemen alleging a violation of their right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 21 above).', 'It is true that in this instance the Constitutional Court declined to entertain Mr Gubi ’ s complaint (see paragraph 13 above). However, the effectiveness of a remedy for the purposes of Article 13 (art. 13) does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome (see, among other authorities, the Costello-Roberts judgment, cited above, p. 62, para. 40). The second applicant consequently had available to him a remedy satisfying the requirements of that provision.', 'It is not therefore necessary for the Court to consider whether the Complaints Division constitutes a ""national authority"" within the meaning of Aof Article 13 (art. 13).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10 (art. 14+10)', '56. The applicants complained finally that they had each been the victim of a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10). The violation of their right to freedom of expression amounted to discrimination on political grounds.', 'Having regard to its conclusions concerning Article 10 (art. 10), the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on this complaint.', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '57. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Damage', '1. Pecuniary damage', '58. The VDSÖ claimed 14,800,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) for pecuniary damage. This sum represented the amount that the Ministry of Defence would have had to pay the association if it had decided to buy and distribute der Igel from 27 July 1987, the date of the association ’ s request (see paragraph 8 above).', '59. The Court agrees with the Delegate of the Commission that the violation of Article 10 (art. 10) derives not from the failure to pay the VDSÖ but solely from the refusal of the military authorities to distribute der Igel. The claim is accordingly unfounded.', '2. Non-pecuniary damage', '60. The VDSÖ and Mr Gubi claimed in addition compensation for non-pecuniary damage in an amount which they left to the discretion of the Court.', '61. The Delegate of the Commission supported this claim.', '62. Like the Government, who pointed out that der Igel ceased publication in 1988, the Court considers that the present judgment affords the applicants sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage that they may have suffered.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '63. The applicants claimed a total of ATS 360,952.34 for costs and expenses: ATS 113,267.56 for the proceedings before the national authorities and ATS 247,684.78 for those before the Convention institutions.', '64. The Government agreed to pay ATS 110,000.', '65. Having regard to the criteria laid down in its case-law and making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicants ATS 180,000 in respect of all their costs and expenses.']",3,at,001-57908,0

The applicant is an association based in Amsterdam and at the material time it published a weekly called Bluf! for a left-wing readership. Since then the periodical has ceased publication.', '8. In the spring of 1987 the editorial staff of Bluf! came into possession of a quarterly report by the internal security service (Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst - ""the BVD""). Dated 1981 and marked ""Confidential"", it was designed mainly to inform BVD staff and other officials who carried out work for the BVD about the organisation ’ s activities. It showed that at that time the BVD was interested in, among other groups, the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the anti-nuclear movement. It also mentioned the Arab League ’ s plan to open an office in The Hague and gave information about the Polish, Czechoslovakian and Romanian security services ’ activities in the Netherlands.', 'The editor of Bluf! proposed to publish the report with a commentary as a supplement to issue no. 267 of the journal on 29 April 1987.', 'A. The seizure', '9. On 29 April 1987, before the journal was published or sent out to subscribers, the director of the BVD informed the public prosecutor (Officier van Justitie) of the plan to publish the report and pointed out that its dissemination was likely to infringe Article 98a paras. 1 and 3 and Article 98c para. 1 of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht - see paragraph 20 below). In his letter he stated:', '""Although, in my opinion, the various contributions taken separately do not (or do not any longer) contain any State secrets, they do - taken together and read in conjunction - amount to information whose confidentiality is necessary in the interests of the State or its allies. This is because the juxtaposition of the facts gives an overview, in the various sectors of interest, of the information available to the security service and of the BVD ’ s activities and method of operation.""', '1. The preliminary judicial investigation', '10. On the same day a preliminary judicial investigation (gerechtelijk vooronderzoek) in respect of a person or persons unknown was commenced on an application by the public prosecutor. The investigating judge (rechter-commissaris) of the Amsterdam Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) ordered the applicant association ’ s premises to be searched and had the entire print run of issue no. 267 of Bluf!, including the supplement, seized. The police apparently did not take away the offset plates remaining on the printing presses. Three people were arrested but released the following day.', '11. During the night of 29 April 1987, unknown to the authorities, the staff of the applicant association managed to reprint the issue that had been seized. Some 2,500 copies were sold in the streets of Amsterdam the next day, which was the Queen ’ s birthday and a national holiday. The authorities decided not to put a stop to this so as not to cause any public disorder.', '12. On 6 May 1987 the investigating judge closed the investigation on the ground that he had no basis on which to continue it. In a letter of 2 June 1987 the public prosecutor informed the applicant association that proceedings against the three people arrested during the seizure were being dropped, as the evidence against two of them was insufficient and the third had played a minimal role.', '2. The complaints by the applicant association', '13. In the meantime, on 1 May 1987, the applicant association had complained of the seizure to the Review Division of the Amsterdam Regional Court under Article 552a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering - see paragraph 21 below), seeking the return of the confiscated copies, their supplements and the wrappers so that they could be sent out to subscribers in time.', 'This application was dismissed on the same day in so far as it related to the copies of the journal and supplement. The court considered that, in view of their content, it was not ""highly unlikely"" that in the criminal proceedings an order would be made for the periodical ’ s withdrawal from circulation (onttrekking aan het verkeer). The court did, however, order the return of an insert entitled ""A Contribution to the Jewish History Museum"" and the wrappers.', '14. In a judgment of 17 November 1987 (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (NJ) 1988, 394) the Supreme Court dismissed appeals on points of law that the applicant association and the public prosecutor lodged against that decision. In respect of the applicant association ’ s ground of appeal based on a violation of Article 7 of the Constitution (see paragraph 19 below), the court held that the right secured in that provision was limited by the phrase ""subject to each person ’ s liability under the law"" and that the seizure of the printed matter to be distributed was among the measures capable of safeguarding the interests which Articles 98 and 98a of the Criminal Code were intended to protect.', '15. In the interval, on 12 May 1987, the applicant association had lodged a second complaint with the Review Division of the Amsterdam Regional Court. Relying on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, it challenged the lawfulness (rechtmatigheid) of the seizure. In the alternative, it sought the return of the confiscated items on the ground that as the judicial investigation had been terminated, the measure had ceased to be justified.', 'On 11 January 1988 the court dismissed the complaint. It ruled that it was identical with the one of 1 May 1987 and that no new factor justified returning the property. Relying on the statement from the public prosecutor ’ s office to the effect that it would make an application to have the journal withdrawn from circulation as soon as the Supreme Court had given judgment on the appeal on points of law against the decision of 1 May, the court held that it was still not to be excluded that such a measure might be taken. Consequently, it rejected the applicant association ’ s submission based on the decision not to prosecute (see paragraph 12 above).', 'B. The withdrawal from circulation', '16. On 25 March 1988 the public prosecutor applied to the Amsterdam Regional Court for an order that issue no. 267 of Bluf! should be withdrawn from circulation.', '17. On 21 June 1988 the court allowed the application on the basis of Articles 36b and 36c of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 20 below). It held that as the seized items were designed to commit the offence set out in Article 98 and/or Article 98a para. 1 taken together with para. 3 of the Criminal Code, the unsupervised possession of them was contrary to the law and the public interest. Moreover, the measure was justified under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention on the grounds of maintaining ""national security"".', '18. In a judgment of 18 September 1989 (NJ 1990, 94) the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant association.', 'It held that the court below had clearly established that an offence covered either by Article 98a para. 1 taken together with para. 3 or by Article 98 had been committed and that it did not have to choose between the provisions indicated. Articles 36b para. 1 (4) and 36c para. 1 (5) were applicable even though neither the applicant association nor any other person had had to answer for their actions in the criminal proceedings. The reprinting and distribution of the issue in dispute after the seizure was no bar either, since the fact of making information public, covered by Article 98, did not necessarily have the consequence that secrecy should not be preserved. Articles 98 and 98a contained statutory provisions envisaged in Article 7 of the Constitution and Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention; since the seizure and withdrawal from circulation were designed to safeguard the interests protected by Articles 98 and 98a, they fell within the permitted restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. In referring to national security, the court below had clearly shown that what was in issue in the instant case was information whose secrecy was necessary in the interests of the State. Lastly, the seizure and withdrawal from circulation could not be equated with imposing a condition of ""prior authorisation"", even though the public could not acquaint itself with the opinions and ideas contained in the printed matter.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The Constitution', '19. Article 7 para. 1 of the Constitution provides:', '""No one shall need prior authorisation in order to express his opinions or ideas through the press, subject to each person ’ s liability under the law.""', 'B. The Criminal Code', '20. At the material time the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:', 'Article 36b para. 1', '""An order for the withdrawal of seized items from circulation may be made', '(1) in a judgment in which a person is convicted of a criminal offence and a sentence is imposed;', '...', '(4) in a separate judicial order made on an application by the public prosecutor.""', 'Article 36c', '""Any of the following items are liable to be withdrawn from circulation:', '...', '(5) those made or intended for the commission of the offence; in so far as they are of such a nature that the unsupervised possession of them is contrary to the law or the public interest.""', 'Article 98', '""1.

Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! applied to the Commission on 4 May 1988. Relying on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, it complained of the seizure and the subsequent withdrawal from circulation of issue no. 267 of its periodical Bluf!. It also complained of a breach of Article 6 paras. 1, 2 and 3 (a) (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3-a) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) in that as the judicial investigation had been closed, it had not had an opportunity to defend itself against the charge underlying the foregoing two measures and had been deprived of its property without due process.', '23. On 29 March 1993 the Commission declared the application (no. 16616/90) admissible as to the first complaint and inadmissible as to the remainder. In its report of 9 September 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion by sixteen votes to two that there had been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT', '24. In their memorial the Government expressed the opinion that', '""the requirements of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention [had been] met in [the] case, so that there [was] no question of there having been any contravention of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', '25. The applicant association maintained that the seizure and subsequent withdrawal from circulation of issue no. 267 of Bluf! had infringed its right to freedom of expression. It relied on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '26. The Government disputed this submission, while the Commission accepted it as regards the withdrawal from circulation.', 'A. Whether there were ""interferences""', '27. The Court notes that the impugned measures amounted to interferences by a public authority in the applicant association ’ s exercise of its freedom to impart information and ideas. None of those appearing before it contested this.', 'B. Justification for the interferences', '28. Such interferences infringe Article 10 (art. 10) unless they were ""prescribed by law"", pursued a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) and were ""necessary in a democratic society"" to achieve it.', '1. ""Prescribed by law""', '29. The Government considered that the basis for the seizure was provided by Articles 94 and 104 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 above) and for the withdrawal from circulation by Articles 36b para. 1 (4) and 36c (5) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 20 above). Issue no. 267 of Bluf! imparted information whose secrecy was necessary in the interests of the State, an offence under Articles 98 and 98a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 20 above).', '30. In the applicant association ’ s submission, the seizure of printed matter such as the weekly in question and its withdrawal from circulation only conformed to the fundamental principle of the rule of law contained in the concept ""prescribed by law"" if they were ordered in the context of criminal proceedings. Given the importance of the right to freedom of expression, only such proceedings afforded sufficient safeguards. In the instant case, however, that condition had not been satisfied, so that the public prosecutor ’ s office obtained the order for seizure and withdrawal without having had to prove in adversarial proceedings that the information in issue had to be kept secret.', 'Furthermore, it said, the proceedings had contravened Netherlands law, among other reasons because the guilt of the party concerned had never been established and Article 7 of the Constitution prohibited preventive measures where a publication was concerned. Lastly, the seizure and withdrawal were not penalties within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) but measures of expediency.', '31. The Commission considered it sufficient that the impugned measures were based on Articles 98a and 98c of the Criminal Code.', '32. The Court cannot accept the argument that Article 10 (art. 10) precludes ordering the seizure and withdrawal from circulation of printed matter other than in criminal proceedings. National authorities must be able to take such measures solely in order to prevent punishable disclosure of a secret without taking criminal proceedings against the party concerned, provided that national law affords that party sufficient procedural safeguards. Netherlands law satisfies that condition by allowing the party concerned to complain both of a seizure and of a withdrawal from circulation (see paragraph 21 above) - opportunities of which the applicant association availed itself.', 'As to the applicant association ’ s second allegation, the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, p. 36, para. 25). In the instant case the Supreme Court considered and rejected the applicant association ’ s submissions on two occasions (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above). The European Court sees no reason to suppose that Netherlands law was not correctly applied.', 'In conclusion, the interferences were ""prescribed by law"".', '2. ""Legitimate aim""', '33. The applicant association conceded that at the time of the seizure the ban on publishing the quarterly report might in theory have served the purpose of ""national security"". It asserted, on the other hand, that as soon as the reprint of issue no. 267 had been distributed, the same was no longer true as the material was no longer secret.', '34. In the Government ’ s submission, persons and groups representing a threat to national security could have discovered, by reading the report, whether and to what extent the BVD was aware of their subversive activities. The way in which the information had been presented could also have given them an insight into the secret services ’ methods and activities. They had thus had a chance of using this information to the detriment of national security.', '35. The Court recognises that the proper functioning of a democratic society based on the rule of law may call for institutions like the BVD which, in order to be effective, must operate in secret and be afforded the necessary protection. In this way a State may protect itself against the activities of individuals and groups attempting to undermine the basic values of a democratic society.', '36. In view of the particular circumstances of the case and the actual terms of the decisions of the relevant courts, the interferences were unquestionably designed to protect national security, a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', '3. ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '37. The applicant association submitted that the seizure and withdrawal to prevent distribution of issue no. 267 of Bluf! were not necessary in a democratic society for the protection of national security, as the six-year-old report had been given the lowest confidentiality rating when it appeared in 1981. Furthermore, the measures had become pointless after the reprint of the issue had been distributed, since the confidentiality of the information had been breached. In refraining from intervening, the State had recognised that its confidentiality was not of the first importance. In any event, account had to be taken of the applicant association ’ s manifest intention of contributing, by publishing the material, to the public debate then under way in the Netherlands on the BVD ’ s activities.', '38. The Government maintained that as the seizure complied with the requirements of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), the same was true of its prolongation and of the subsequent withdrawal from circulation, since these were designed to prevent the report from falling into the hands of unauthorised persons. The information should have remained confidential. It was for the State to decide whether it was necessary to impose and preserve such confidentiality. The State was also in the best position to assess the use that might be made of the information by subversive elements to the detriment of national security. Against that background, it should be allowed a wide margin of appreciation.', 'The Netherlands authorities had refrained from preventing distribution of the reprint solely for fear of causing serious public disorder in view of the vast crowds on the streets of Amsterdam on 30 April 1987, the Queen ’ s birthday. The withdrawal from circulation remained in force after that date because the journal had been distributed only locally and in limited quantities. The figure of 2,500 copies sold, advanced by the applicant association, was exaggerated. Moreover, to hold that the measures were no longer effective following distribution of the periodical would be tantamount to accepting that ""crime pays"".', 'Lastly, the instant case differed from the cases of Weber v. Switzerland (judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 23, para. 51), The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) (judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, p. 30, para. 54) and Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland (judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 31, para. 76). In this instance, unlike the situation in the first of those cases, the Netherlands authorities had brought proceedings to prevent publication; and, unlike the situation in the other two cases, the information in the report could not be obtained by other means.', '39. In the light of these submissions, it must be ascertained whether there were sufficient reasons under the Convention to justify the seizure and withdrawal.', '40. Because of the nature of the duties performed by the internal security service, whose value is not disputed, the Court, like the Commission, accepts that such an institution must enjoy a high degree of protection where the disclosure of information about its activities is concerned.', '41. Nevertheless, it is open to question whether the information in the report was sufficiently sensitive to justify preventing its distribution. The document in question was six years old at the time of the seizure. Further, it was of a fairly general nature, the head of the security service having himself admitted that in 1987 the various items of information, taken separately, were no longer State secrets (see paragraph 9 above). Lastly, the report was marked simply ""Confidential"", which represents a low degree of secrecy. It was in fact a document intended for BVD staff and other officials who carried out work for the BVD (see paragraph 8 above).', '42. Like the Commission, the Court does not consider that it must determine whether the seizure carried out on 29 April 1987, taken alone, could be regarded as ""necessary"".', '43. The withdrawal from circulation, on the other hand, must be considered in the light of the events as a whole. After the newspaper had been seized, the publishers reprinted a large number of copies and sold them in the streets of Amsterdam, which were very crowded (see paragraphs 11 and 38 above).', 'Consequently, the information in question had already been widely distributed when the journal was withdrawn from circulation. Admittedly, the figure of 2,500 copies advanced by the applicant association was disputed by the Government. Nevertheless, the Court sees no reason to doubt that, at all events, a large number were sold and that the BVD ’ s report was made widely known.', '44. In this latter connection, the Court points out that it has already held that it was unnecessary to prevent the disclosure of certain information seeing that it had already been made public (see the Weber judgment previously cited, pp. 22-23, para. 49) or had ceased to be confidential (see the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 33-35, paras. 66-70, and the Sunday Times (no. 2) judgment previously cited, pp. 30-31, paras. 52-56).', '45. Admittedly, in the instant case the extent of publicity was different. However, the information in question was made accessible to a large number of people, who were able in their turn to communicate it to others. Furthermore, the events were commented on by the media. That being so, the protection of the information as a State secret was no longer justified and the withdrawal of issue no. 267 of Bluf! no longer appeared necessary to achieve the legitimate aim pursued. It would have been quite possible, however, to prosecute the offenders.', '46. In short, as the measure was not necessary in a democratic society, there has been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '47. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', '48. The applicant association ’ s claim was solely for reimbursement of the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings in the national courts and thereafter before the Convention institutions. Once the sums received in legal aid in the Netherlands and before the Commission have been deducted, they amounted to 77,773 Netherlands guilders (NLG) plus NLG 13,052 in value-added tax (VAT).', '49. The Government pointed out that the applicant association had received legal aid both in the national proceedings and before the Convention institutions. They considered that only the expenses and fees before those institutions could be taken into account and they drew attention to the very large amounts sought.', '50. The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view.', '51. Having regard to its case-law and to the sum paid in legal aid, the Court assesses the amount to be paid on an equitable basis for costs and expenses at NLG 60,000 inclusive of VAT.']",3,nl,001-57915,1

He gave as sources for his article, in addition to his own experience of attending a number of trials, statements of lawyers and legal correspondents and surveys carried out by university researchers.', 'After a short summary of his main contention, followed by a general introduction, he described in detail the attitude of nine members of the Vienna Regional Criminal Court ( Landesgericht für Strafsachen ), including that of Judge J.', '1.

The susceptibility of judges was capable of turning the courtroom into a ""battlefield""; a convicted person who caused even the slightest offence to the self-esteem of a judge risked, through the effect of the latter ’ s so-called unfettered discretion to assess the evidence, an extra year of imprisonment or losing the possibility of having his sentence suspended.', 'Mr Prager then criticised judges who acquitted only as a last resort, who handed down much heavier sentences than most of their colleagues, who treated lawyers like miscreants, who harassed and humiliated the accused to an excessive degree, who extended remand detention beyond the maximum duration of the sentence risked and who disregarded the jury ’ s verdict when they did not agree with it. He maintained that their independence served only to inflate inordinately their self-importance and enabled them to apply the law in all its cruelty and irrationality, without any scruples and without anyone being able to oppose them.', 'Mr Prager continued by recounting his personal experiences from meeting judges and visiting courtrooms, referring in this connection to the ""arrogant bullying"" ( menschenverachtende Schikanen ) of Judge J.', '3. The description of the judges', '11. The article also gave a description of a number of individual judges. That of Judge J. read as follows:', '""Type: rabid ... [J.].', '...', '[J.], addressing the Vienna lawyer [K.], counsel for the defence, some years ago: `Keep it short. I ’ ve already reached my decision. ’', '[J.]: a judge who does not allow probation officers to sit down in his office. In fact he refuses to speak to them.', '[J.]: a judge who once laid a complaint against a prostitute because he had already paid her when she and her pimp vanished without anything having happened. She probably thought that her client was too drunk to notice the difference. [J.] however lay in wait and took down the car ’ s registration number.', '[J.] ’ s complaint resulted in the prostitute ’ s conviction - and disciplinary proceedings for himself, which proved really effective because the smutty story, which at least says a lot for [J.] ’ s pigheadedness, got into the newspapers.', 'Despite all this he almost became a public prosecutor. But the press revealed a story in which his name cropped up again, this time in connection with criminal proceedings and the suspicion of having given legal advice without due authorisation ( Winkelschreiberei ). Two men, Mr L. and his son, were accused of having obtained money from people wishing to buy flats in old buildings, by means of fraudulent contracts. When it became clear that the contracts had been drawn up by [J.], the prosecution changed tactics: suddenly it was no longer the contracts that were fraudulent, but the intention which lay behind their use.', '[J.] remained a judge instead of becoming a public prosecutor. The editors of Kurier [an Austrian daily newspaper] now regret this because a public prosecutor is less dangerous.', 'In September Profil [an Austrian magazine] showed why. In his capacity as an investigating judge, [J.] had left a drug addict in detention on remand for over one year, although the remand prisoner ’ s officially appointed defence counsel repeatedly told him that he was mistaken about the quantity of drugs involved and that the relevant sentence would be from four to six months ’ imprisonment.', 'Notwithstanding this, rather than forwarding the final plea of nullity to the Supreme Court, as he was required to do by the regulations, he transmitted it to the Court of Appeal and to the President of the Court of Appeal, who took a further three months to consider whether the man should be released from prison and whether any mistakes had been made by the investigating judge.', 'A photocopier would have spared the prisoner at least those three months. Released at the beginning of March by the new judge to whom the case-file had been forwarded by the Supreme Court judges, the case having at last been brought before them, the prisoner, who had spent thirteen months in prison, was finally sentenced to five months ’ imprisonment at the end of March.', 'The two defence lawyers appointed by the authorities to act for [J.] ’ s victim calculate that the lawyers ’ fees alone up to that date amounted to 85,000 schillings.', 'All this does not seem to have left Judge [J.] unscathed. The tall, bearded judge has a deep, resonant voice. Yet throughout the trial of Marianne O., the `holiday-thief ’, a persistent tick was to be seen on the face of Judge [S.] ’ s colleague on the Bench.', 'Then the jury ’ s verdict was suspended and defence counsel [G.] found himself facing disciplinary proceedings.""', 'B. The action for defamation', '12. On 23 April 1987 Judge J. brought an action against Mr Prager for defamation ( üble Nachrede, Article 111 of the Austrian Criminal Code - see paragraph 18 below). In addition to the seizure of the relevant Forum issue and the publication of extracts of the judgment, he sought, inter alia, damages from the publisher and an order imposing a fine on the latter jointly and severally with the author and requiring them to pay the legal costs (sections 33 to 36 of the Media Act - Mediengesetz, see paragraph 19 below).', '13. On 11 May 1987 the applicants challenged the Vienna Regional Criminal Court and the Vienna Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ). On 5 August the Supreme Court ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the challenge concerning the Court of Appeal. On 17 September it allowed that directed against the Vienna Regional Criminal Court and transferred the case to the Eisenstadt Regional Court.', '1. At first instance', '14. On 11 October 1988 the Eisenstadt Regional Court found Mr Prager guilty of having defamed Judge J. by passages in the impugned article, which were cited as follows:', '(1) ""They treat each accused at the outset as if he had already been convicted.""', '(2) ""Some Austrian criminal court judges are capable of anything.""', '(3) ""Nothing was comparable to ... Judge [J.] ’ s arrogant bullying.""', '(4) ""Type: rabid ... [J.].""', '(5) ""Despite all this he almost became a public prosecutor. But the press revealed a story in which his name cropped up again, this time in connection with criminal proceedings and the suspicion of having given legal advice without due authorisation. Two men, Mr L. and his son, were accused of having obtained money from people wishing to buy flats in old buildings, by means of fraudulent contracts. When it became clear that the contracts had been drawn up by [J.], the prosecution changed tactics: suddenly it was no longer the contracts that were fraudulent, but the intention which lay behind their use.', '[J.] remained a judge instead of becoming a public prosecutor. The editors of Kurier now regret this because a public prosecutor is less dangerous.""', 'Applying Article 111 of the Criminal Code, the Regional Court sentenced Mr Prager to 120 day fines at the rate of 30 schillings (ATS) per day and to sixty days ’ imprisonment in the event of non-payment. Mr Oberschlick was ordered to pay Judge J. damages of ATS 30,000 and was declared jointly and severally liable with the first applicant in respect of the fine and the legal costs (sections 6 (1) and 35 of the Media Act). Finally, the court ordered the confiscation of the remaining stocks of the relevant issue of Forum and the publication of extracts from its judgment.', '15. In the grounds of its judgment the Regional Court noted in the first place that the objective elements of the offence of defamation were made out. Of the contested passages, nos. 2 and 4 openly attributed to the plaintiff a despicable character or attitude ( eine verächtliche Eigenschaft oder Gesinnung ), while nos. 1, 3 and 5 accused him of conduct that was dishonourable and dishonest and that could objectively expose him to contempt or denigrate him in the public eye ( ein unehrenhaftes und gegen die guten Sitten verstoßendes Verhalten, das objektiv geeignet ist, ihn in der öffentlichen Meinung verächtlich zu machen oder herabzusetzen ). In short, confronted with such wholesale criticism, an impartial reader had little choice but to suspect that the plaintiff had behaved basely ( ehrloses Verhalten ) and that he was of despicable character ( verächtliche Charaktereigenschaften ), and the author had, moreover, been perfectly well aware of this.', 'The Regional Court then examined Mr Prager ’ s applications for the production of documents and testimony intended to establish the truth of his statements and the journalistic care that he had exercised in writing the article. The court took the view that only passages nos. 1, 3 and 5 were susceptible to this type of proof, as the other statements were value-judgments. After considering the matter, it decided that none of the evidence offered could sufficiently substantiate the allegations in issue.', 'Thus statement no. 1, according to which Judge J. treated every accused at the outset as if he had already been convicted, was not proved merely by the fact that the judge in question had, in a given case, asked defence counsel to be brief, as he had already made up his mind. Similarly, the three decisions of Judge J. reported by Mr Prager in support of statement no. 3 were not sufficient to bear out the allegation that the judge had adopted bullying tactics. None of these decisions disclosed the slightest intention to cause unnecessary suffering. Lastly, the accusations made in passage no. 5 had been definitively refuted by a disciplinary decision of the Vienna Court of Appeal of 6 December 1982. The two files whose production the applicant had requested could not alter the position, since the first contained no information on the personality of Judge J. and the second, relating to the judge ’ s candidature for the office of public prosecutor, had to remain confidential.', 'In the court ’ s view, Mr Prager had also failed to prove that he had written the article in issue with the care required of journalists by section 29 (1) of the Media Act (see paragraph 19 below). Not content with having denied Judge J. an opportunity to answer the accusations levelled against him, his research had been conducted in a very superficial manner; moreover, he had himself admitted that he had not attended any trials presided over by Judge J., that he had reproduced the content of old newspaper articles without checking their accuracy and had represented as true allegations based on hearsay.', '2. On appeal', '16. On 26 June 1989 the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld this judgment, but reduced the damages to ATS 20,000 (see paragraph 14 above). It held in particular that the Regional Court had in no way infringed the rights of the defence by dismissing as immaterial the evidence that Mr Prager had sought to adduce. This situation had arisen because of the way in which he had formulated his criticism. It had been so comprehensive and general that it had been impossible to specify evidence capable of establishing its accuracy. The case could, moreover, be distinguished from the case of Lingens v. Austria (judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103) in that it concerned the affirmation of various facts rather than the expression of value-judgments. As regards the care that journalists are required to exercise in pursuing their profession, it must obey the rule"" audiatur et altera pars"".', '17. The remaining copies of the issue in question were never in fact seized (see paragraph 14 above).']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', '1. The Criminal Code', '18. Article 111 of the Criminal Code provides:', '""1. Anyone who in such a way that it may be perceived by a third party accuses another of possessing a contemptible character or attitude or of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...', '2. Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...', '3. The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. As regards the offence defined in paragraph 1, he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true.""', 'Article 112 provides:', '""Evidence of the truth and of good faith shall not be admissible unless the person making the statement pleads the correctness of the statement or his good faith ...""', 'Under Article 114 para. 1 ""conduct of the kind mentioned in Article 111 ... is justified if it constitutes the fulfilment of a legal duty or the exercise of a right"". Under paragraph 2 of the same provision ""a person who is forced for special reasons to make an allegation within the meaning of Article 111 ... in the particular form and manner in which it was made, shall not be guilty of an offence, unless that allegation is untrue and he could have realised this if he had exercised due care ..."".', '2. The Media Act', '19. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim damages from him. Furthermore, the publisher may be declared to be liable jointly and severally with the person convicted of a media offence for the fines imposed and for the costs of the proceedings (section 35).', 'The person defamed may request the forfeiture of the publication by which a media offence has been committed (section 33). Under section 36 he may also request the immediate seizure of such a publication if section 33 is likely to be applied subsequently, unless the adverse consequences of seizure would be disproportionate to the legal interest to be protected by this measure. Seizure shall not be ordered if that interest can instead be protected by the publication of information that criminal proceedings have been instituted (section 37). Finally, the victim may request the publication of the judgment in so far as this appears necessary for the information of the public (section 34).', 'Section 29 (1) provides, inter alia, that publishers and journalists will avoid conviction of an offence in respect of information susceptible to proof as to its accuracy, not only if they provide such proof, but also if there was a major public interest in publishing the information and reasons which, in exercising proper journalistic care, justified giving credence to the statement in question.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '20. In their application (no. 15974/90) lodged with the Commission on 21 December 1989, Mr Prager and Mr Oberschlick complained that their convictions constituted a violation of their right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention and that the order confiscating the remaining copies of the periodical amounted to discrimination prohibited under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10). They also alleged a violation of Articles 6 and 13 (art. 6, art. 13) of the Convention.', '21. On 29 March 1993 the Commission declared the complaints concerning Articles 10 and 14 (art. 10, art. 14) admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 28 February 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion by fifteen votes to twelve that there had been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) and unanimously that there had been no violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '22. In their memorial the Government requested the Court:', '(a) to declare inadmissible the complaints of the second applicant based on a violation of Articles 14 and 10 of the Convention taken together (art. 14+10) and Article 10 (art. 10) taken in isolation for respectively failure to exhaust domestic remedies and lack of status of victim;', '(b) to hold that the applicants have not been the victims of a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', '23. The applicants invited the Court to find a violation of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', '24. The applicants complained of a violation of their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'A. The Government ’ s preliminary objection', '25. The Government contended, as they had done unsuccessfully before the Commission, that Mr Oberschlick could not claim to be a ""victim"" within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1) of the Convention. Inasmuch as he had simply published an article that he had not written himself, he could not be said to have exercised his own freedom of expression. In addition he had not sustained any pecuniary damage as a result of the proceedings brought against him: he had not had to pay anything, as joint debtor, in respect of the fine and the procedural costs and he could claim reimbursement from Mr Prager for any other expenditure incurred in connection with the convictions (see paragraphs 14-15 above).', '26. By ""victim"" Article 25 (art. 25) means the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue, a violation being conceivable even in the absence of any detriment; the latter is relevant only to the application of Article 50 (art. 50) (see, inter alia, the Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 20, para. 47).', '27. Like the Commission and the applicants, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings initiated by Judge J. ’ s complaint were directed at both Mr Prager and Mr Oberschlick. The latter was personally convicted for having published an article in his periodical (see paragraph 14 above). He was therefore directly affected by the decisions of the Eisenstadt Regional Court and the Vienna Court of Appeal. He can, accordingly, claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.', 'In conclusion, the Government ’ s preliminary objection falls to be dismissed.', 'B. Merits of the complaint', '28. It is not in dispute that Mr Prager ’ s conviction for defamation and the other measures of which the applicants complained amounted to an ""interference"" with the exercise by them of their freedom of expression.', 'That interference infringed Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" to attain such aim or aims.', '1. ""Prescribed by law""', '29. In the applicants ’ submission, Article 111 of the Austrian Criminal Code and section 29 of the Media Act could not be regarded as ""law"" within the meaning of the Convention. In so far as these provisions left it solely to the complainant to determine which passages of a text were to be the subject of the proceedings and prevented the accused from adducing evidence of material facts, their application did not afford a sufficient degree of foreseeability.', '30. In several earlier cases, the Court found that Article 111 of the Criminal Code had the characteristics of ""law"" (see the following judgments: Lingens, cited above, p. 24, para. 36; Oberschlick v. Austria, 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 24, para. 54; Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 31-32, para. 25). Nor is there anything to warrant a different conclusion with regard to section 29 of the Media Act. The uncertainties linked to the application in this instance of these two provisions did not exceed what the applicants could expect, if need be after having sought appropriate advice (see, mutatis mutandis, the Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi v. Austria judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, pp. 18-19, para. 46).', '2. Whether the aim pursued was legitimate', '31. Like the Commission, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the decisions in issue were intended, as the Government affirmed, to protect the reputation of others, in this case Judge J., and to maintain the authority of the judiciary, which are legitimate aims for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', '3. Necessity of the interference', '32. The applicants argued that the convictions were in no way justified. By giving a brief character-sketch of various representative members of the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, Mr Prager had merely raised certain serious problems confronting the Austrian system of criminal justice. In this type of magazine, recourse to caricature and exaggeration was common practice as a means of attracting the readers ’ attention and increasing their awareness of the issue dealt with. The author had on no account abused this technique in this instance, especially in view of the fact that his article had appeared in a periodical for intellectuals capable of discernment. Moreover, of the nine judges described, only Judge J. had laid a complaint.', 'At the same time Mr Prager and Mr Oberschlick criticised the proceedings conducted against them. They had been denied adequate means to defend themselves. Judge J. had identified on his own, and without his choice being open to challenge, the passages of the article liable to give rise to a conviction; he had thus isolated various general sentences and expressions from their context - in particular passages nos. 1 and 2 (see paragraph 14 above) - and had incorrectly presented them as being directed against himself. The Regional Court had not only operated a flawed distinction between the allegations (passages nos. 1, 3 and 5) and the value-judgments (passages nos. 2 and 4), but it had also improperly denied the applicants the right to prove various events capable of establishing that the former were true and that the latter were fair comment (see paragraph 15 above). As regards the facts in respect of which the court had allowed evidence to be adduced, it had, in breach of the law, placed the onus of showing that they were true facts on the accused. This was an approach that would ultimately deter journalists from taking an interest in the system of justice.', 'Finally, it was incorrect to claim that Mr Prager had not exercised due journalistic care in writing his article. On the contrary, he had based his text on research conducted over a period of six months during which he had contacted lawyers, judges and academics. In addition, for three and a half months he had attended hearings in the Vienna Courthouse on a daily basis.', '33. The Government maintained that, far from stimulating debate on the functioning of the Austrian system of justice, the relevant extracts of the article had only contained personal insults directed at Judge J., despite the fact that the latter had done nothing to provoke Mr Prager. They did not therefore merit the enhanced protection accorded to the expression of political opinions. The author had failed to prove the truth of his affirmations quite simply because they were unfounded. The opinions expressed by Mr Prager could not qualify for total immunity just because they were not susceptible to verification as to their accuracy. Penalties had been imposed in respect of those statements because they had overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism. Mr Prager could not plead good faith in his defence as he had neglected the most elementary rules of journalism, in particular those which require a journalist to verify personally the truth of information obtained and to give the persons concerned by such information the opportunity to comment on it.', '34. The Court reiterates that the press plays a pre-eminent role in a State governed by the rule of law. Although it must not overstep certain bounds set, inter alia, for the protection of the reputation of others, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart - in a way consistent with its duties and responsibilities - information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, para. 43).', 'This undoubtedly includes questions concerning the functioning of the system of justice, an institution that is essential for any democratic society. The press is one of the means by which politicians and public opinion can verify that judges are discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them.', 'Regard must, however, be had to the special role of the judiciary in society. As the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against destructive attacks that are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying.', '35. The assessment of these factors falls in the first place to the national authorities, which enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in determining the existence and extent of the necessity of an interference with the freedom of expression. That assessment is, however, subject to a European supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court (see, inter alia, the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, para. 28).', '36. In the Court ’ s opinion the classification of the passages in issue as value-judgments and allegations of fact comes within the ambit of that margin of appreciation.', 'Of the accusations levelled by those allegations, some were extremely serious. It is therefore hardly surprising that their author should be expected to explain himself. By maintaining that the Viennese judges ""treat each accused at the outset as if he had already been convicted"", or in attributing to Judge J. an ""arrogant"" and ""bullying"" attitude in the performance of his duties, the applicant had, by implication, accused the persons concerned of having, as judges, broken the law or, at the very least, of having breached their professional obligations. He had thus not only damaged their reputation, but also undermined public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary as a whole.', '37. The reason for Mr Prager ’ s failure to establish that his allegations were true or that his value-judgments were fair comment lies not so much in the way in which the court applied the law as in their general character; indeed it is that aspect that seems to have been at the origin of the penalties imposed. As the Commission pointed out, the evidence shows that the relevant decisions were not directed against the applicant ’ s use as such of his freedom of expression in relation to the system of justice or even the fact that he had criticised certain judges whom he had identified by name, but rather the excessive breadth of the accusations, which, in the absence of a sufficient factual basis, appeared unnecessarily prejudicial. Thus the Eisenstadt Regional Court stated in its judgment that ""confronted with such wholesale criticism, an impartial reader had little choice but to suspect that the plaintiff had behaved basely and that he was of despicable character"" (see paragraph 15 above).', 'Nor, in the Court ’ s view, could Mr Prager invoke his good faith or compliance with the ethics of journalism. The research that he had undertaken does not appear adequate to substantiate such serious allegations. In this connection it suffices to note that, on his own admission, the applicant had not attended a single criminal trial before Judge J. Furthermore he had not given the judge any opportunity to comment on the accusations levelled against him.', '38. It is true that, subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), freedom of expression is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any section of the community (see, mutatis mutandis, the Castells judgment, cited above, p. 22, para. 42, and the Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi judgment, cited above, p. 17, para. 36). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation.', 'However, regard being had to all the circumstances described above and to the margin of appreciation that is to be left to the Contracting States, the impugned interference does not appear to be disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. It may therefore be held to have been ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '39. In conclusion no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) has been established.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10 (art. 14+10)', '40. In their application to the Commission, Mr Prager and Mr Oberschlick also alleged a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) (see paragraph 20 above). They did not, however, raise this complaint before the Court and the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this issue of its own motion.']",3,at,001-57926,0

Mrs Dorothée Piermont, a German citizen living at Remagen, has long been an environmentalist and a pacifist. At the material time she was a member of the European Parliament (MEP).', 'A. The measure taken in French Polynesia', '1. The expulsion and exclusion (interdiction d ’ entrée) order', '9. At the invitation of Mr Oscar Temaru, the President of the French Polynesian Liberation Front, the applicant stayed on Polynesian territory from 24 February to 3 March 1986, during the election campaign preceding the territorial assembly and parliamentary elections that were due to take place on 16 March.', '10. As soon as she alighted from the aircraft, the airport and border police, acting on the orders of the High Commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia, requested her to show some discretion in any comments she made on French internal matters, failing which she risked being expelled.', '11. On 28 February 1986 Mrs Piermont took part in a public meeting and on 1 March joined about 900 other people in the traditional march organised by the independence and anti-nuclear movements. This demonstration, which attracted fewer people than in the previous year, took place without incident on the streets of Faaa, a town just outside Papeete, where it had been banned by order of the High Commissioner because of the risk of ""serious public disorder"".', 'During the demonstration the applicant denounced the continuation of nuclear testing and the French presence in the Pacific. Her words were reported as follows in the newspapers:', '""Mrs Piermont spoke in French and mentioned, in particular, the circumstances in which, on her arrival at Tahiti Airport, she had been warned by the ‘ chief copper ’ in charge of the airport and border police against taking part in a public demonstration, as doing so during an election campaign would amount to interference.', 'Mrs Piermont had replied that she would demonstrate if invited to do so, and she told the demonstrators gathered round her on Saturday that when it came to interference, the French presence was an interference in the affairs of the Polynesians, and this interference was, in her view, manifested in the nuclear tests at Mururoa.', 'Mrs Piermont announced that, being of the view that the whole of the press in French Polynesia was opposed to the trend towards independence and supported the continuation of nuclear testing, the German ‘ Greens ’ had decided to donate one million CFP francs to the Polynesian Liberation Front to set up ‘ a newspaper that will tell the truth ’ .""', '12. On the next day, 2 March 1986, the High Commissioner made an order expelling the applicant and prohibiting her from re-entering the territory. The following reasons were given for the order:', '""All foreign nationals have a duty to maintain a degree of neutrality towards any French territory in which they are staying.', 'Despite an oral warning about the duty of discretion, particularly during an election campaign, given to her on her arrival on 24 February 1986, Mrs Piermont stated, during a public demonstration in favour of the territory ’ s independence and against nuclear testing, that France was interfering in Polynesian affairs.', 'These statements are an attack on French policy.""', '13. This order was served on the applicant on 3 March 1986 when she was already on board the aircraft that was to take her to New Caledonia.', '2. The application for judicial review', '(a) In the Papeete Administrative Court', '14. On 15 April 1986 Mrs Piermont made two applications to the Papeete Administrative Court seeking, firstly, to have execution of the decision stayed and, secondly, to have the decision quashed.', '15. The court dismissed the first application on 8 July 1986, but in a judgment of 23 December 1986 it allowed the second application for the following reasons:', '""Under the provisions of section 7 of the Act ... of 3 December 1849 ..., the representative of the State may ‘ as a public-order measure ’ require any alien to leave French territory immediately. While the State ’ s representative in the territory is vested, not only under these provisions ..., with a wide discretion to enable him to maintain order effectively, he must in all circumstances exercise the power thus conferred on him in a manner that respects freedom of movement and freedom of expression, which are secured not only by European Community law but in the first place by the Constitution and the general principles of law which the Republic applies both to its own nationals and to aliens whose presence and attitude on French territory do not constitute a threat to public order. This entails an obligation to ensure that the proposed public-order measure scrupulously conforms to what is strictly needed in order to maintain or re-establish public order.', 'Firstly, the applicant ’ s utterances ... were not in any way seditious and could not in themselves constitute a serious threat to public order. They were accordingly not such as to justify the impugned measure.', 'Secondly, it furthermore appears from the evidence that the measure was decided on just as the person concerned was about to leave the territory of her own accord. That being so, it could no longer be regarded as essential for maintaining order there.', 'It follows, without there being any need to rely on international or Community law, that the general principles of domestic law are sufficient to establish that the impugned decision was a misuse of authority and must therefore be quashed.""', '(b) In the Conseil d ’ Etat', '16. The Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories applied to the Conseil d ’ Etat on 16 March 1987 to have the Administrative Court ’ s judgment set aside.', '17. On 12 May 1989 the Conseil d ’ Etat allowed the application on the following grounds:', '""It appears from the evidence that during her visit to French Polynesia Mrs Piermont made utterances violently hostile to France ’ s defence policy and the integrity of French territory in the course of public demonstrations held during the campaign for the elections to the French National Assembly and to the local assembly. In considering, in the circumstances of the case, that Mrs Piermont ’ s actions constituted a threat to public order and in deciding on those grounds to require her to leave the territory, the High Commissioner did not commit a manifest error of assessment. That being so, the Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories rightly submitted that the Papeete Administrative Court, in quashing the order of 2 March 1986, wrongly based its decision on the lack of grounds warranting Mrs Piermont ’ s expulsion.', '...', 'In the absence of provisions making it applicable to the territory of Polynesia and Dependencies, the Act of 11 July 1979 on the giving of reasons for administrative decisions and the improvement of relations between administrative authorities and the public does not apply there, and no other provision of a statute or of regulations requires reasons to be given for a public-order measure.', 'Although Mrs Piermont relies on the provisions of the Treaty of Rome concerning freedom of movement within the territory of the member States, Articles 135 and 227 of the Treaty make implementation of such freedom of movement in the associated countries, which include France ’ s overseas territories, subject to agreements to be concluded subsequently, which require the member States ’ unanimous approval.

The measure taken in New Caledonia', '1. The exclusion (interdiction d ’ entrée) order', '18. After leaving Polynesia on 3 March 1986 (see paragraph 13 above), Mrs Piermont travelled to New Caledonia at the invitation of local elected representatives, including the President of the Socialist Kanak National Liberation Front. On 4 March, at 1.55 p.m., she arrived at Nouméa Airport. After she had gone with the other passengers through immigration control, where the airport and border police stamped her passport, a police officer stopped her and took her into an airport office, where she was held until her departure.', '19. Some forty activists known as loyalists had been warned that the applicant was coming and were waiting for her in order to express their hostility to her presence in the territory. They made it known that so long as the MEP was on Caledonian soil they would not leave unless removed by force.', '20. Given the risk of confrontation and after unsuccessful attempts at conciliation, the High Commissioner issued an order excluding Mrs Piermont from the territory of New Caledonia. It contained the following reasons:', '""Having regard to the expulsion and exclusion order of 2 March 1986 issued by the High Commissioner in French Polynesia in respect of Mrs Piermont ...;', 'Being of the view that the presence of Mrs Dorothée Piermont, of German nationality (FRG), on the territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies, in particular during an election campaign, is causing and is likely to cause public disorder ...""', 'A police superintendent served this order on her whilst she was still within the airport perimeter, at about 6.30 p.m.', 'At about midnight the applicant was put on an aircraft bound for Tokyo, her passport having again been duly stamped.', '2. The application for judicial review', '(a) In the Nouméa Administrative Court', '21. On 23 April 1986 Mrs Piermont applied to the Nouméa Administrative Court to have the order excluding her from New Caledonia quashed.', '22. In a judgment of 24 December 1986 which upheld the submissions of the Government Commissioner (commissaire du gouvernement), the court quashed the impugned decision on the ground that no reasons had been given for it. It held:', '""Under section 1 of the Act of 11 July 1979 on the giving of reasons for administrative decisions, ‘ ... reasons must be given for decisions which ... restrict the exercise of public freedoms or generally constitute public-order measures ’.', 'Under section 3 of the same Act, ‘ the statement of reasons required by this Act must be in writing and set out the considerations of law and fact on which the decision is based ’.', 'Although the impugned order referred to the order of 2 March 1986 issued by the High Commissioner in French Polynesia expelling Mrs Piermont and excluding her from that territory, the High Commissioner in New Caledonia and Dependencies did not state that he was adopting the terms of that order, whose text is neither incorporated in nor appended to his decision. That recital accordingly could not take the place of the statement of reasons required by the Act.', 'Moreover, by merely stating ‘ the presence of Mrs Dorothée Piermont, of German nationality (FRG), on the territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies, in particular during an election campaign, is causing and is likely to cause public disorder ’ without specifying the facts on which this public-order measure was based, the High Commissioner in New Caledonia and Dependencies did not satisfy the requirements of section 3 of the aforementioned Act. That being so and without there being any need to consider the other grounds put forward in her application, Mrs Piermont is entitled to have that order quashed.""', '(b) In the Conseil d ’ Etat', '23. On 16 March 1987 the Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories appealed to the Conseil d ’ Etat.', '24. In a judgment of 12 May 1989 the Conseil d ’ Etat set aside the judgment of the court below. After noting that the aforementioned Act of 11 July 1979 did not apply to the territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies, it gave the following reasons for its decision:', '""Under section 7 of the Act of 3 December 1849 on the naturalisation and residence of aliens in France, which is still in force in the overseas territories and applies in the territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies, ‘ the Minister of the Interior may, as a public-order measure, require any alien travelling or resident in France to leave French territory immediately and have him escorted to the frontier ’ ... Regard being had both to Mrs Piermont ’ s actions during the preceding days and to the unrest caused by the announcement of her arrival in the territory, the High Commissioner, in considering that Mrs Piermont ’ s presence would constitute a threat to public order and in ordering her exclusion from the territory of New Caledonia on that account, did not commit any manifest error of assessment.', 'Although Mrs Piermont relies on the provisions of the Treaty of Rome concerning freedom of movement within the territory of the member States, Articles 135 and 227 of the Treaty make implementation of such freedom of movement in the associated countries, which include France ’ s overseas territories, subject to agreements to be concluded subsequently, which require the member States ’ unanimous approval.

The revocation of the order', '25. On 23 November 1994 the High Commissioner of the Republic, of his motion, revoked the order of 4 March 1986 on the ground that there was no longer ""any reason, having regard to present circumstances, to oppose Mrs Piermont ’ s entering the territory of New Caledonia "".']","['II. RELEVANT LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. French law', '1. General aspects', '26. France ’ s overseas territories (""the OTs"") are an integral part of the territory of the Republic.', '27. However, by virtue of the ""specificity of legislation"" principle (Articles 74 and 76 of the Constitution), an enactment applies in the OTs only if such application is expressly provided for or if the enactment has been promulgated there.', '28. When depositing the instruments of ratification of the Convention and of Protocol No. 4 (P4) on 3 May 1974, France declared that these would apply to ""the whole territory of the Republic, having due regard, where the overseas territories are concerned, to local requirements, as mentioned in Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention"".', '2. Entry and residence of aliens', '(a) Legislation', '29. The Aliens (Conditions of Entry and Residence) Ordinance of 2 November 1945 in force in metropolitan France was not promulgated in the OTs and accordingly does not apply in them.', 'The applicable provisions are contained in the Aliens (Naturalisation and Residence) Act of 3 December 1849, section 7 of which provides in its first subsection:', '""The Minister of the Interior may, as a public-order measure, require any alien travelling or resident in France to leave French territory immediately and have him escorted to the frontier.""', 'This Act was made applicable to the colonies by an Act of 29 May 1874. An Act of 6 September 1984 vests the powers of the Minister of the Interior in the High Commissioner of the Republic in the OTs.', '(b) The Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s case-law', '30. At the material time the Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s power of review in matters of expulsion or exclusion from French territory was limited to ascertaining whether there had been any manifest error of assessment (see, for example, the National Immigration Office judgment of 22 October 1975, Recueil Lebon 1975, p. 520, and, in relation to an expulsion from New Caledonia, the Julbe-Saez judgment of 6 October 1978, Recueil Lebon 1978, p. 900).', 'With more particular reference to the political activities of aliens, the Conseil d ’ Etat held in the Perregaux judgment of 13 May 1977 (Recueil Lebon 1977, p. 216) that political activity did not in itself justify in law the expulsion of an alien whose presence on French territory did not constitute a threat to public order.', 'B. Community law', '1. Scope of the treaty establishing the European Economic Community', '31. At the material time Article 227 of the treaty establishing the European Economic Community (""the EEC Treaty"") provided:', '""1. This Treaty shall apply to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', '2.

The OTs, including French Polynesia and New Caledonia, are among the territories listed in Annex IV to the EEC Treaty. Their special arrangements for association are laid down in Articles 131 to 136 bis of the treaty.', '33.

The details of and procedure for the association of the overseas countries and territories with the EEC are set out in an implementing convention of 16 December 1980, which was renewed on 30 June 1986. The arrangements are designed to further the economic and social development of the territories concerned but do not include freedom of movement.', '2. Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities', '35. The Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities, signed on 8 April 1965, contains a chapter III on members of the European Parliament which provides:', 'Article 8', '""No administrative or other restriction shall be imposed on the free movement of members of the European Parliament travelling to or from the place of meeting of the European Parliament.', 'Members of the European Parliament shall, in respect of customs and exchange control, be accorded:', '(a) by their own Government, the same facilities as those accorded to senior officials travelling abroad on temporary official missions;', '(b) by the Governments of other Member States, the same facilities as those accorded to representatives of foreign Governments on temporary official missions.""', 'Article 9', '""Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.""', 'Article 10', '""During the sessions of the European Parliament, its members shall enjoy:', '(a) in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament;', '(b) in the territory of any other Member State, immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings.', 'Immunity shall likewise apply to members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the European Parliament.', 'Immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found in the act of committing an offence and shall not prevent the European Parliament from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its members.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '36. Mrs Piermont applied to the Commission on 6 and 8 November 1989. She alleged that the administrative measures taken against her in French Polynesia and New Caledonia had infringed several provisions of the Convention: Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) on account of failure to respect her right to liberty of movement on French territory; Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention because her freedom of expression had been hindered; and Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10) on account of discrimination on the ground of national origin.', '37. The Commission, having ordered the joinder of the applications (nos. 15773/89 and 15774/89), declared them admissible on 3 December 1992. In its report of 20 January 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that', '(a) the expulsion and exclusion from French Polynesia had not infringed Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) (unanimously) but had infringed Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention (eight votes to six);', '(b) the exclusion from New Caledonia had not contravened Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) (thirteen votes to one) or Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention taken either alone (twelve votes to two) or together with Article 14 (art. 10+ 14) (unanimously).', 'The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the five separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '38. In their memorial the Government asked the Court ""to dismiss Mrs Piermont ’ s application"".', '39. Counsel for the applicant requested the Court to hold', '""(a) that there has been a violation in French Polynesia of Article 10 (art. 10), taken both alone and together with Article 14 (art. 10+14);', '(b) that there has been a violation in French Polynesia of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2);', '(c) that there has been a violation in New Caledonia of Article 10 (art. 10), taken both alone and together with Article 14 (art. 10+14);', '(d) that there has been a violation in New Caledonia of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2);', '...""', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 2 OF PROTOCOL No. 4 (P4-2)', '40. The applicant complained of the measures taken against her in French Polynesia and New Caledonia. In her submission, they infringed her right to liberty of movement secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2), which provides:', '""1. Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.', '...', '3. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are in accordance with law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the maintenance of ordre public, for the prevention of crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.', '...""', 'A. The measure taken in French Polynesia', '41. Mrs Piermont maintained that, having entered French Polynesia lawfully, she had had the right to liberty of movement there. The expulsion order, which had been held to be unlawful by the Papeete Administrative Court, could not have had the least effect on the lawfulness of her position in the archipelago. Even though it had been served on her as she was leaving Polynesian territory, she had suffered an interference which did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2-3). In March 1986 an election campaign had been in progress in Polynesia as throughout metropolitan France, but there had not been any particular tensions there. Furthermore, the words spoken had not in any way been of a seditious nature such as to be a threat to public order.', '42. In the Government ’ s submission, Polynesia was a territory separate from metropolitan France for the purposes of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2), for two reasons. Firstly, in virtue of the ""specificity of legislation"" principle, the OTs had a legal system distinct from that of metropolitan France (see paragraph 27 above). Secondly and above all, Article 5 para. 4 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-5-4) provided: ""The territory of any State to which this Protocol (P4) applies ..., and each territory to which this Protocol (P4) is applied by virtue of a declaration by that State under this Article (P4-5), shall be treated as separate territories for the purpose of the references in Articles 2 and 3 (P4-2, P4-3) to the territory of a State."" Once the expulsion order had been served on her, the applicant was accordingly no longer lawfully in Polynesia.', 'In the alternative, if Article 2 (P4-2) was regarded as being applicable, the Government maintained that at all events there had been no breach of the right to liberty of movement. Mrs Piermont was travelling neither to nor from the European Parliament ’ s place of meeting, so that she could not rely on the immunities attaching to her status as a member of that parliament (see paragraph 35 above). As for Community law, it did not guarantee any right to liberty of movement in the OTs for workers (assuming that the applicant fell within that category) who were nationals of Community States (see paragraphs 33-34 above). Lastly, the interference was justified by the local authorities ’ legitimate concern to maintain public order and safety in Tahiti.', '43. The Commission, having regard to the special legal status of Polynesia and the fact that the territory had to be treated as distinct from metropolitan France, took the view that the applicant, once expelled from Polynesia, was no longer there lawfully and consequently could no longer claim to enjoy the right to liberty of movement.', '44. The Court notes that the expulsion order of 2 March 1986 was served on Mrs Piermont next day when she had already taken her seat in the aircraft (see paragraph 13 above). The applicant, who was not travelling on business for the European Parliament, had been able to move around Polynesia as she wished from 24 February to 3 March 1986 and during that period had suffered no interference with the exercise of her right to liberty of movement within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2).', 'It also points out that when depositing their instrument of ratification, the French Government had declared that Protocol No. 4 (P4) would apply to ""the whole territory of the Republic, having due regard, where the overseas territories [were] concerned, to local requirements, as mentioned in Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention"" (see paragraph 28 above). Article 5 para. 4 of the Protocol (P4-5-4) (see paragraph 42 above) requires that Polynesia should be regarded as a separate territory for the purposes of the references in Article 2 (P4-2) to the territory of a State. At all events, the Aliens (Conditions of Entry and Residence) Ordinance 1945 had not been promulgated there (see paragraph 29 above). As a result, once the expulsion order had been served, the applicant was no longer lawfully on Polynesian territory and in those circumstances did not suffer any interference with the exercise of her right to liberty of movement, as secured by the provision in question, at that point either.', '45. In conclusion, there has been no breach of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2).', 'B. The measure taken in New Caledonia', '46. Mrs Piermont submitted that, having entered New Caledonia lawfully, she should have been able to move there freely. An expulsion measure had been taken against her that had incorrectly been described as an exclusion (interdiction d ’ entrée) and had been quashed by the Nouméa Administrative Court. That it was in reality an expulsion was beyond doubt, since she had gone through immigration control without incident, as was duly proved by the stamping of her diplomatic passport.', 'The impugned measure, she argued, had not been in accordance with law since the law made no mention of the possibility of excluding an alien from the territory. Nor was it justified, as her participation in a peaceful anti-nuclear demonstration in French Polynesia had not been such as to warrant her expulsion from New Caledonia, where France was not conducting any atomic experiments. The same was true of the pro-independence beliefs that she had expressed in Polynesia. As to the demonstrators opposed to her staying in Nouméa, it was the duty of the police to disperse them.', '47. The Government maintained that Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) did not apply to the case. In making the order, described by the Conseil d ’ Etat as a decision ""excluding Mrs Piermont from the territory of New Caledonia "", the High Commissioner had clearly meant to prohibit her from entering the territory and not to expel her from it. The stamping of her passport by the airport and border police was merely an administrative formality recording that the applicant had arrived at the frontier and that it had been checked that her papers were in order. This check did not preclude the High Commissioner from exercising the special powers he held in virtue of the territory ’ s legal status or the ordinary police powers, inherent in his office, for keeping public order. The applicant had accordingly never been legally authorised by the administrative authorities to enter the territory. Even supposing that she had been there lawfully, the considerations of public order which had warranted restrictions on her liberty of movement in Polynesia had also, the Government submitted, justified the ones imposed in New Caledonia.', '48. The Commission accepted the Government ’ s main argument in substance.', '49. In the instant case the Court considers that the applicant ’ s argument that the mere fact of going through immigration control regularises a person ’ s position in a territory is too formalistic. At an airport such as Nouméa ’ s a passenger remains liable to checks for as long as he remains within the perimeter. In this instance Mrs Piermont was stopped just after her passport had been stamped and the impugned order was served on her before she had left the airport, since she was still held in an office under police guard.', 'The order made by the High Commissioner of the Republic is headed ""Order prohibiting an alien from entering the territory"" and Article 1 of it embodies that prohibition. The Conseil d ’ Etat, in its decision of 12 May 1989, did not question the nature of the order. That being so, the applicant was never lawfully within the territory, a requirement if Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) is to apply. There has therefore been no breach of that provision (P4-2).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', '50. The applicant alleged that the administrative measures taken against her also infringed her right to freedom of expression. She relied on Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'A. The measure taken in French Polynesia', '1. Whether there was an interference', '51. In Mrs Piermont ’ s submission, the expulsion measure coupled with the ban on re-entering French Polynesia was intended to censor her political opinions and the expression of them on Polynesian soil - this notwithstanding her position as a member of the European Parliament, which entitled her to take an interest in the territory. It therefore amounted to an ""interference by public authority"" with the exercise of her right to freedom of expression.', '52. The Government admitted that there had been an interference but characterised it as minimal.', '53. Like the Commission, the Court considers that there was indeed an interference.', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '54. The Government maintained that the interference in question had not breached Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, for three reasons: it was in accordance with ""local requirements"" within the meaning of Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention; it came within the ambit of Article 16 (art. 16) of the Convention; and it satisfied the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', '(a) Justification under Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention', '55. Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention provides:', '""1. Any State may at the time of its ratification or at any time thereafter declare by notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that the ... Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible.', '2. ...', '3. The provisions of [the] Convention shall be applied in such territories with due regard, however, to local requirements.', '4. ...""', '56. The Government submitted that the ""local requirements"" of French Polynesia made the interference legitimate. France ’ s declaration, at the time of ratification, on the applicability of the Convention to the OTs (see paragraph 28 above) was, they said, equivalent to a reservation. In the instant case the ""local requirements"" were the indisputable special features of protecting public order in the Pacific territories, namely their island status and distance from metropolitan France and also the especially tense political atmosphere during the years 1985-86.', '57. In the applicant ’ s submission, the Government had not proved the existence of such ""local requirements"". There had been no particular unrest in Polynesia at the time and the mere fact that an election campaign had been in progress did not justify the application of Article 63 para. 3 (art. 63-3). This view was supported, she said, by the submissions of the Government Commissioner at the Papeete Administrative Court when it was considering her application for a stay of execution of the order of 2 March 1986: ""I cannot, for my part, see what local requirements could justify not applying the Convention provisions relied on in this case.""', '58. The Delegate of the Commission, referring to the Tyrer v. the United Kingdom judgment (25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 18, para. 38), considered that the Government had not adduced positive and conclusive proof of requirements arising from the special character of French Polynesia.', '59. The Court notes that the arguments put forward by the Government relate essentially to the tense local political atmosphere taken together with an election campaign and therefore emphasise circumstances and conditions more than requirements. A political situation, admittedly a sensitive one but also one which could occur in the mother country, does not suffice in order to interpret the phrase ""local requirements"" as justifying an interference with the right secured in Article 10 (art. 10).', '(b) Justification under Article 16 (art. 16) of the Convention', '60. Article 16 (art. 16) of the Convention provides:', '""Nothing in Articles 10, 11 and 14 (art. 10, art. 11, art. 14) shall be regarded as preventing the High Contracting Parties from imposing restrictions on the political activity of aliens.""', '61. According to the Government, Mrs Piermont could not rely on her status either as a member of the European Parliament or as a European citizen and she therefore came within the scope of Article 16 (art. 16). She had, they submitted, been invited less in her capacity as an MEP than as a member of the German ""Greens"" party and she had expressed her views at the independence demonstration on issues relating to the territorial integrity of the host country and national defence, fields which lay outside the competence of the Community. Furthermore, the recognition, after the material time, of a ""citizenship of the Union"" was irrelevant. Lastly, the member States of the Community had reserved the right to lay down the circumstances in which nationality could be acquired or lost. Accordingly, anyone who did not possess the nationality of the country in which he intended to exercise the freedoms guaranteed in Articles 10, 11 and 14 (art. 10, art. 11, art. 14) had to be regarded as an alien.', '62. The applicant replied that the restrictions in Article 16 (art. 16) did not apply in her case because of her dual status as a European citizen and an MEP. To object that she was an alien when the nature of her functions entailed taking an interest in the whole of the Community ’ s territory seemed to her to be beside the point.', '63. The Commission accepted the applicant ’ s submissions in substance.', '64. The Court cannot accept the argument based on European citizenship, since the Community treaties did not at the time recognise any such citizenship. Nevertheless, it considers that Mrs Piermont ’ s possession of the nationality of a member State of the European Union and, in addition to that, her status as a member of the European Parliament do not allow Article 16 (art. 16) of the Convention to be raised against her, especially as the people of the OTs take part in the European Parliament elections.', 'In conclusion, this provision (art. 16) did not authorise the State to restrict the applicant ’ s exercise of the right guaranteed in Article 10 (art. 10).', '(c) Justification under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2)', '65. It must be ascertained whether the interference was prescribed by law, pursued a legitimate aim and was ""necessary in a democratic society"".', '(i) ""Prescribed by law""', '66. In the applicant ’ s submission, the interference resulting from the exclusion order had not been prescribed by law, because section 7 of the Act of 3 December 1849 (see paragraph 29 above) did not give the Minister of the Interior the power to prohibit someone from ""re-entering the territory"", as was stated in the order made on 2 March 1986 by the High Commissioner in French Polynesia.', '67. The Government argued that there was a legal basis for the interference in the Act of 3 December 1849 and the Act of 6 September 1984, the latter of which vested the powers of the Minister of the Interior in the High Commissioner of the Republic in the OTs (see paragraph 29 above).', '68. As Mrs Piermont has not returned to Polynesia, the Court considers it pointless to rule on the exclusion. Like the Commission, it finds that the expulsion was based on section 7 of the Act of 3 December 1849.', '(ii) ""Legitimate aim""', '69. The applicant asserted that the prevention of disorder could not justify the expulsion order as the latter nowhere stated that what she had said had caused public disorder.', '70. The Government argued that the impugned interference pursued two aims recognised in the Convention: the prevention of disorder, and territorial integrity.', '71. The Commission accepted the legitimacy of the first of those but expressed no view as to the second.', '72. The Court considers that, regard being had to the particular circumstances of the case, the interference pursued the two aims relied on by the Government.', '(iii) ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '73. Mrs Piermont contended that the measure had been neither necessary in a democratic society nor proportionate to the aims pursued. The utterances held against her appeared in the programmes of the local political parties and had in no way constituted a threat to public order, as had been noted by the Papeete Administrative Court; the situation in Polynesia in March 1986 had been peaceful. The impugned speech went with the tide of history, seeing that the French Government had suspended nuclear tests in the region in 1992 and, under the Matignon agreements, had recognised the right of the Caledonian people to self-determination through a referendum. The applicant had merely taken part in a democratic debate initiated locally by elected representatives of the people, whom she met in her capacity as a European elected representative. It was a case in which the requirements of the upholding of public order had to be weighed against the interests of ""free discussion of political issues"". At all events, the measure taken could not be justified by a threat to public order in the sense in which the term was used in both national and Community case-law. Lastly, the freedom guaranteed in Article 10 (art. 10) applied regardless of frontiers, and alternative legal means existed for punishing the conduct complained of, such as criminal proceedings for defamation.', '74. The Government had no intention of denying a member of the European Parliament the right to speak freely and to talk with representatives of a recognised political party. Nevertheless, the values she embodied should prompt her to express herself in a manner consistent with those very values. Since freedom of expression also entailed duties, the tense local political atmosphere and the imminence of two sets of elections called for some caution on Mrs Piermont ’ s part, particularly when she intended to speak in her capacity as an MEP. She had, however, made vehement utterances calling in question the legal order of the French Republic and the institutions of Polynesia. Lastly, she could not complain of a continuing interference as she had not sought to have the order revoked.', '75. The Commission considered the interference to be unjustified under Article 10 (art. 10). It had regard to the fact that no unrest had been caused in the archipelago by the applicant ’ s stances and to the risk that such measures might discourage politicians from contributing to the political discussion of controversial issues.', '76. The Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, one of the basic conditions for its progress. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"" (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 22, para. 42). A person opposed to official ideas and positions must be able to find a place in the political arena. ""While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people ... Accordingly, interferences with [his] freedom of expression ... call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court"" (ibid., pp. 22-23, para. 42).', 'Freedom of political debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature. A Contracting State may make it subject to certain ""restrictions"" or ""penalties"", but it is for the Court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) (ibid., p. 23, para. 46).', '77. In the Court ’ s opinion, the political atmosphere prevailing in French Polynesia at the time and the prospect of the two sets of elections are factors of some weight (see paragraph 9 above). The conduct of the applicant, whose political ideas were well known, could undoubtedly have had a special impact on the political atmosphere. Furthermore, she was requested on her arrival to show some discretion in what she said in public.', 'Nevertheless, the utterances held against Mrs Piermont were made during a peaceful, authorised demonstration. At no time did the MEP call for violence or disorder; she spoke in support of the anti-nuclear and independence demands made by several local parties. Her speech was therefore a contribution to a democratic debate in Polynesia. Moreover, the demonstration was not followed by any disorder and the Government did not show that the stances taken up by the applicant caused any unrest in Polynesia. According to the Papeete Administrative Court, her utterances were ""not in any way seditious and could not in themselves constitute a serious threat to public order"". Furthermore, although the expulsion order was served just before the applicant ’ s departure, it was made the day after the demonstration in issue. There is nothing to show that the intention of the High Commissioner of the Republic had been to take a purely symbolic measure.', 'A fair balance was accordingly not struck between, on the one hand, the public interest requiring the prevention of disorder and the upholding of territorial integrity and, on the other, Mrs Piermont ’ s freedom of expression.', '78. In short, since the measure was not necessary in a democratic society, there has been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'B. The measure taken in New Caledonia', '1. Whether there was an interference', '79. The applicant maintained that neither lawful entry nor lawful residence was required for Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention to apply. Because of the measure taken against her, she had not been able to meet her hosts, who wished to have a discussion with her, or to speak in New Caledonia.', '80. In the view of the Government and the Commission, the fact that Mrs Piermont had been unable to exercise her right to freedom of expression in that territory was a necessary consequence of the refusal to let her enter it, a measure which in itself complied with the Convention.', '81. The Court does not share this opinion. The exclusion order made by the High Commissioner of the Republic amounted to an interference with the exercise of the right secured by Article 10 (art. 10) as, having been detained at the airport, the applicant had not been able to come into contact with the politicians who had invited her or to express her ideas on the spot.', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '82. The applicant reiterated, mutatis mutandis, her submissions in respect of the measure taken against her in French Polynesia. She highlighted the fact that the interference had not been prescribed by law as the relevant order prohibited her from entering the territory, a measure that was not covered by section 7 of the Act of 1849 (see paragraph 29 above). Admittedly, the situation was not as quiet in New Caledonia as in Polynesia, but the French Government had very large forces available to it locally for keeping order and these would have had no difficulty in containing and dispersing a demonstration by forty anti-independence campaigners.', '83. The Government added to their arguments concerning the first measure the observation that there had been a more acrimonious atmosphere in New Caledonia. Tension between the independence campaigners and those in favour of the territory ’ s remaining in the French Republic had, they said, become exacerbated in 1985 and early 1986, a period which had been marked by numerous attacks on public buildings. Movable and immovable property belonging to independence campaigners had been destroyed and this had led to reprisals in the form of arson attacks and stone-throwing. The announcement of Mrs Piermont ’ s arrival in Nouméa had contributed to heightening this tension, as was shown by the incidents at the airport. The exclusion had therefore been fully justified by the authorities ’ duty to maintain public order.', '84. The Court accepts that the measure was prescribed by law, and it refers to the submissions of the Government Commissioner at the Nouméa Administrative Court. Even if some doubts may be entertained as to whether section 7 of the Act of 3 December 1849 applied to the instant case, which concerned not an expulsion in the strict sense but a refusal of entry, the High Commissioner was entitled to use his general police powers to ban the applicant from entering New Caledonia on grounds of public safety.', '85. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court again stresses the importance of freedom of expression. The applicant ’ s behaviour and the fear that she would express her views on sensitive topics on the spot could account for the reasons given for the refusal to let her enter Caledonian territory. Even if the political atmosphere was tense and Mrs Piermont ’ s arrival led to a limited demonstration of hostility, the Court discerns no substantial difference in the applicant ’ s position vis-à-vis the two territories. The reasons which prompted it to hold that the measure taken in French Polynesia was not justified in the light of the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) lead it to make an identical finding in respect of New Caledonia.', '86. In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION, TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 10 (art. 14+10)', '87. Relying on Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10), Mrs Piermont lastly claimed that she was the victim of discrimination in comparison with French citizens resident in Polynesia and in New Caledonia. Foreigners were not able to enjoy the right secured in Article 10 (art. 10).', '88. The Government disputed that submission, relying on the lack of evidence as regards the measure taken in Polynesia and the non-applicability of Article 14 (art. 14) as regards the one taken in New Caledonia.', '89. The Commission considered that it was not necessary for the measure taken in Polynesia to be looked at under Article 14 (art. 14). It also pointed out that since the applicant had not entered New Caledonia, she had not been able to exercise there the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 14 (art. 10, art. 14).', '90. Having regard to its findings in relation to Article 10 (art. 10), the Court considers it unnecessary to ascertain whether there has also been a breach of Article 14 taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10).', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '91. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Damage', '92. Mrs Piermont sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 200,000 French francs (FRF). As justification for this sum, she cited her exclusion from both territories and the contemptuous way in which the French authorities, particularly in New Caledonia, had treated her.', '93. Like the Government and the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the findings of violations of Article 10 (art. 10) constitute sufficient just satisfaction, especially as the applicant has not sought to have the exclusion order revoked (see paragraph 25 above).', 'B. Costs and expenses', '94. In respect of the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings in Papeete and Nouméa and thereafter before the Convention institutions, Mrs Piermont claimed a sum of FRF 489,654.40, of which she provided particulars. She also sought reimbursement of a sum of FRF 60,000 relating to her personal expenses, comprising refund of the cost of the ticket for travel by air from Tokyo to Bonn, her journeys to consult her lawyers and attend the hearings before the Commission and the Court and sundry expenses, to which she added 15,267 German marks, representing the cost of the ticket for travel by air from Nouméa to Bonn, which had not been used on account of her having been put on an aircraft bound for Tokyo.', '95. The Government and the Delegate of the Commission left it to the Court ’ s discretion to assess the costs and expenses that had actually and reasonably been incurred by the applicant.', '96. The Court notes, inter alia, that Mrs Piermont ’ s claims have succeeded only in part and that the applicant called on the services of three lawyers. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, in the light of the information in its possession and its own case-law, the Court awards her FRF 80,000.']",2,fr,001-57925,1

Count Nikolai Tolstoy Miloslavsky, a British citizen, lives in Southall, Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. He is a historian.', 'A. The impugned pamphlet', '8. In March 1987 a pamphlet written by the applicant and entitled ""War Crimes and the Wardenship of Winchester College"" was circulated by Mr Nigel Watts to parents, boys, staff and former members of the school as well as to Members of Parliament, Members of the House of Lords and the press. Mr Watts bore a grievance against the Warden of Winchester College, Lord Aldington, at the time Chairman of an insurance company, concerning an insurance claim. The pamphlet included the following statements:', '""Between mid-May and early June 1945 some 70,000 Cossack and Yugoslav prisoners-of-war and refugees were handed over to Soviet and Titoist communist forces as a result of an agreement made with the British 5 Corps administering occupied Austria. They included a large proportion of women, children, and even babies. The majority of Cossack officers and their families handed over held League of Nations passports or those of the Western European countries in which they had found refuge after being evacuated from Russia by their British and French Allies in 1918-20, and were hence not liable to return under the terms of the Yalta Agreement, which related only to Soviet citizens.', '...', 'As was anticipated by virtually everyone concerned, the overwhelming majority of these defenceless people, who reposed implicit trust in British honour, were either massacred in circumstances of unbelievable horror immediately following their handover, or condemned to a lingering death in Communist gaols and forced labour camps. These operations were achieved by a combination of duplicity and brutality without parallel in British history since the Massacre of Glencoe. Outside Lienz may be seen today a small Cossack cemetery, whose tombstones commemorate men, women and children shot, clubbed, or bayoneted to death by British troops.', '...', ""The man who issued every order and arranged every detail of the lying and brutality which resulted in these massacres was Brigadier Toby Low, Chief of Staff to General Keightley's 5 Corps, subsequently ennobled by Harold Macmillan as the 1st Baron Aldington. Since 1979 he has been Warden of Winchester College, one of the oldest and most respected of English public schools. Whether Lord Aldington is an appropriate figure for such a post is primarily a matter for the College to decide. But it is also surely a legitimate matter of broader public concern that a man responsible for such enormities should continue to occupy a post of such honour and prominence within the community, in particular one which serves as exemplar for young people themselves likely one day to achieve high office and responsibility."", 'The truth is, however, that Lord Aldington knows every one of his pleas to be wholly or in large part false. The evidence is overwhelming that he arranged the perpetration of a major war crime in the full knowledge that the most barbarous and dishonourable aspects of his operations were throughout disapproved and unauthorised by the higher command, and in the full knowledge that a savage fate awaited those he was repatriating. Those who still feel that a man with the blood of 70,000 men, women and children on his hands, helpless charges whom the Supreme Allied Commander was making every attempt to protect, is a suitable Warden for Winchester might care to ask themselves (or Lord Aldington, if they can catch him) the following questions:', '...', 'Lord Aldington has been repeatedly charged in books and articles, by press and public, with being a major war criminal, whose activities merit comparison with those of the worst butchers of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia ...""', 'B. Libel proceedings', '1. Proceedings in the High Court', '9. Lord Aldington instituted proceedings against Mr Watts for libel in the High Court of Justice (Queen\'s Bench Division). The applicant was subsequently joined to these proceedings at his own request. The defendants pleaded ""justification"" and ""fair comment"".', '10. Lord Aldington asked that the case be heard by a single judge without a jury. However, the applicant exercised his right to trial by jury.', '11. The trial began on 2 October 1989 and lasted until 30 November when the jury of twelve returned its verdict. In the course of the trial Lord Aldington gave evidence for some six and a half days and was cross-examined. The applicant gave evidence for more than five days and a number of witnesses were called.', 'Mr Justice Michael Davies devoted some ten pages of his summing-up to the question of the assessment of damages if defamation were to be established. He directed the jury, inter alia, as follows:', '""... Let us now, members of the jury, ... deal with the aspect of damages ... I have to give you this direction in law because damages may arise ... If the plaintiff wins, you have got to consider damages. Some would say that the only direction on damages necessary in this particular case was to say: [the applicant] says that if damages are to be payable he agrees they should be enormous. Mr Rampton [defence counsel], I do not think, in his final speech could quite bring himself to utter that word, but he said they will be very generous - and I could stop there. But that is not the way, you see, because the parties do not dictate (even if they are making concessions) how you should approach damages. You do it in accordance with the law, and that is what I am now going to tell you. You have to accept my directions about it, and you will apply them of course as you think fit.', '...', 'the means of the parties - the plaintiff or the defendant - is immaterial', '...', 'Neither, as I think I said earlier but I say it now, is the question whether Lord Aldington or [the applicant], or for that matter Mr Watts, have been or will be financially supported by any well wishers as to damages relevant at all. Nor is it relevant the undoubted fact that legal aid is not available in libel cases to a plaintiff or a defendant. All irrelevant, and if it is to be changed it is up to Parliament to do something about it ...', '... what you are seeking to do, what a jury has to do, is to fix a sum which will compensate the plaintiff - to make amends in financial terms for the wrong done to him, because wrong has been done if you have got to the stage of awarding damages. It is not your duty or your right to punish a defendant ...', ""What [Lord Aldington] does claim, of course, is for 'general damages', as lawyers call it, a sum of money to compensate him. First of all, you have to take into account the effect in this case, as in every case where there is libel, on the position, standing and reputation of the successful plaintiff ..."", '... If they [the allegations made in the pamphlet] were untrue and not fair comment, where it is suggested that they were comment, he is entitled to be compensated for that, so that that will register your view of that.', 'Then you have got to consider ... the injury to his feelings. I told you that he cannot, of course, claim on behalf of his wife or any member of his family, although the affect on them may have had an affect on him which is a reaction, which you are entitled to take into account.', 'It is not just his feelings when he read this ... It is his feelings during the time whilst awaiting the trial ... and the publicity ...', ""... you have to consider ... what lawyers call `vindication' ..."", ""You may think - it is a matter for you - that in this particular case vindication - showing that he was right - is the main reason for Lord Aldington bringing this action - that is what he says anyway - to restore his character and standing ... 'An award, an enormous award', to use [the applicant's] words - 'a very generous award' to use Mr Rampton's words, will enable him to say that put the record straight."", 'Members of the jury, of course, you must not, as a result of what I have just said, just bump and bump the damages up. You must, at all times, as they say, keep your feet on the ground.', '... You have to take into account the extent and nature of the publication.', '... whilst you must leave aside any thought of punishing the defendants if you find for the plaintiff, juries are always entitled, as I have hinted already, to take into account any conduct of the defendant which has aggravated the damages - that is to say, made the damage more serious and the award higher - or mitigated them - made the damage done less serious and the award smaller.', '...', 'Now, two general remarks which I make in every case: nobody asks you how you arrive at your verdict, and you do not have to give reasons like a Judge does, so it is exceedingly important that you look at the matter judicially, and that means that you should not be outrageously or unreasonably high, or outrageously or unreasonably low.', 'The second matter I say to every jury is: please, I beg you, if you come to damages, do not pay the slightest attention to any other case or the result of any other case you may have read about or heard about. The facts and the legal considerations are like[ ly ] to have been completely different. There is no league of damages in defamation cases. There is no first division, there is no fourth division, there is no Vauxhall conference, if any of you are interested in football.', ""So, members of the jury, please forget other cases. Use your own common sense about it. How do you translate what I have said into money terms? By our rules and procedure, members of the jury, counsel can use, and a judge can use, words like 'very substantial' or 'very small', but we do not either of us, counsel or judges, mention figures. Some people again, who have not really considered the matter very carefully, wonder about that, and they say juries should be given guidance, and I say to you what I say to every jury in these cases, it would not be a great deal of help for you, because inevitably, it is human nature and it would be their duty - counsel for the plaintiff would be at the top end of the scale and perhaps in some cases, I do not suggest this one, off the clock, and counsel for the defendant would be at the bottom end of the scale in the basement. Now, that would not be much good to anybody. As for the Judge, well the jury might think - you may have an exactly opposite view - a jury might think: 'Well, on the whole, whatever other people say about this particular Judge in this case, we think he tried to be fair, why doesn't he suggest a figure to us?'"", ""Supposing a Judge, myself in this case, were to suggest a figure to you, or a bracket between so and so and so and so, there would be two possibilities: one is that you would ignore what I said and either go higher than my figure or bracket, or much lower, in which case of course the losing party that did not like it would be off to the Court of Appeal saying: 'Look, the Judge suggested a figure and the jury went above it or below it.'"", 'Supposing you accepted my suggestion, and gave a figure that I recommended, or close to it. Well, all I can say is that you would have been wasting your valuable time in considering the matter of damages because you would just have been acting as a rubber stamp for me, or the Judge, whoever it was. So we do not have that over-bidding or under-bidding, as the Court of Appeal has called it, by counsel, and we do not have Judges trying to lay down to juries what they should award, and I do not hesitate to say, whatever other people say, I hope and pray, for the sake of our law and our court, we never get the day when Judges dictate to juries so that they become rubber stamps.', 'I am, however, allowed - indeed encouraged - by the Court of Appeal just to say a little bit more. I say it not perhaps in the words of the Court of Appeal, but in my own way, which may be too homely for some, but I say to you that you must remember what money is. You do not deal in Mickey Mouse money just reeling off noughts because they sound good, I know you will not. You have got to consider money in real terms. Sometimes it is said \'Well, how much would a house cost of a certain kind\', and if you are giving a plaintiff as compensation so much money how many houses is he going to buy? I do not mean to suggest that Lord Aldington or any other plaintiff would take his damages and go and buy a house or a row of houses, but that relates it to the sort of thing, if you will allow me to say, you and I do know something about, because most of us have a pretty good idea how much houses are worth. So remember that.""', '12. In its unanimous verdict of 30 November 1989, the jury answered the questions put by Mr Justice Davies as follows:', '""1. Have [the applicant] and Mr Watts proved that the statements of fact in the pamphlet are substantially true?', '... No.', '2. Does the pamphlet contain expressions of opinion?', '... Yes.', '3. Have [the applicant] and Mr Watts proved that those expressions of opinion are fair, in the sense that they are such as a fair-minded man could honestly make on the facts proved to be true?', '... No.', '4. (1) Do you find for Lord Aldington or for Mr Watts?', '... Lord Aldington.', '(2) Do you find for Lord Aldington or for [the applicant]?', '... Lord Aldington.', '5. What sum in damages do you award Lord Aldington?', '... £1,500,000.""', 'Accordingly, Mr Justice Davies directed that judgment should be entered against the applicant and Mr Watts for the above-mentioned sum, which was approximately three times the largest amount previously awarded by an English libel jury. In addition he granted an application by Lord Aldington for an injunction (section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981) restraining, inter alios, the defendants from publishing or causing or permitting to be published or assisting or participating in or conniving at the publication of the words contained in the impugned pamphlet or', '""any other words or allegations (however expressed) to the following or any similar effect namely that the Plaintiff [Lord Aldington] in connection with the handover in 1945 to Soviet or Yugoslav forces of military or civilian personnel was guilty of disobedience or deception or criminal or dishonourable or inhumane or other improper or unauthorised conduct or was responsible for the subsequent treatment of any such personnel by the Soviets or the Yugoslavs the said defendants being at liberty to apply to vary or discharge this injunction.""', ""The applicant was also ordered to pay Lord Aldington's costs."", '2. Proceedings in the Court of Appeal', ""13. The applicant (but not Mr Watts) gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal setting out a number of grounds, several of which went to the fairness of the proceedings. He criticised Mr Justice Davies among other things for having displayed overt animosity towards the defendants and for his continual interruption, sarcasm and abuse of defence counsel. The Judge had, he alleged, insulted and disparaged the defence witnesses. Throughout his summing-up he had wholly or largely suppressed or ignored many of the most important aspects of the case for the defence and had misled the jury on issues central to the defendants' arguments. When directing the jury on the question of damages, the tenor of the judge's remarks had been in large part to urge the jury to award high damages to the plaintiff and to discount the alternatives which had been reasonably available on the evidence; the damages had in any event been unreasonable and excessive."", ""14. On 9 January 1990 Lord Aldington applied to the Court of Appeal for an order requiring the applicant, under Order 59, Rule 10 (5) of the 1965 Rules of the Supreme Court, to give security in an amount which would cover the costs of his opponent's representation if the appeal were to be unsuccessful. It was not disputed that the applicant would be unable to pay the relevant costs."", ""15. In an open letter of 2 February 1990, Lord Aldington offered not to enforce £1,200,000 of the damages awarded. In his reply the applicant confirmed that he was unable to provide any security for Lord Aldington's costs in the appeal proceedings and, maintaining that the trial had been a travesty of justice, declined the offer."", '16. In a twenty-two-page judgment of 18 May 1990 the Registrar of the Court of Appeal examined the facts raised by the applicant and rejected the application for security for costs. The Registrar stated that impecuniosity was a ground for awarding security for costs in respect of the costs of an appeal to the Court of Appeal. In exercising its discretion in this regard, the Court of Appeal would attach particular weight to the merits, or otherwise, of the appeal concerned. If the appeal had little or no merit, a security for costs order would normally be made against an impecunious appellant. If the appeal had reasonable prospects of success, the court would be reluctant to order security for costs.', ""The Registrar pointed out that he had not found it easy to decide whether the applicant's appeal on liability had sufficient strength to justify allowing him to proceed without furnishing security for costs, given that, if his appeal failed, he would not have the funds to pay Lord Aldington's costs of the appeal. He added that, with some hesitation, he found that on several specific points the appeal had just enough strength to lead him to conclude that security for costs should not be awarded in this case. There was a possibility that if the applicant succeeded in convincing the Court of Appeal that he had not had a fair trial, and his case had not been fairly and clearly put to the jury, the Court of Appeal would conclude that a new trial had to be ordered, notwithstanding the fact that the chances of his succeeding on the new trial were slim."", 'In view of the above conclusion the Registrar did not find it necessary to deal with an argument made by counsel for Lord Aldington that the appeal on quantum would be academic because of his offer of 2 February 1990 (see paragraph 15 above).', ""17. Lord Aldington appealed successfully against the Registrar's decision to the full Court of Appeal, which heard the matter for six days between 9 and 17 July 1990 and gave judgment on 19 July 1990. The members of the Court of Appeal gave, in summary, the following reasons."", '(a) The President, Sir Stephen Brown', ""The Court of Appeal had to consider the application afresh and decide whether to order security would amount to a denial of justice to the applicant, having regard to the merits of his appeal. The criticism made in the applicant's grounds of appeal did not concern Mr Justice Davies's directions on the law but, in particular, what the applicant characterised as bias and partiality on the part of the judge towards Lord Aldington and the way in which the judge had dealt with three particular issues of fact. The criticism was however not justified. Mr Justice Davies had clearly left to the jury the decision on the facts of the case and all the major matters had been dealt with fully and fairly. The judge's summing-up had quite clearly brought to the jury's minds the matters which the defence had contended were of primary significance. Counsel had been given full opportunities to raise matters of alleged error, and when they had deemed it necessary they had done so. Furthermore the principal witnesses had been in the witness-box for some thirteen days in all. Lord Aldington, who had been the central witness in the case in the sense that it was his conduct which was the subject of examination, had been in the witness box for no less than six and a half days. It was inconceivable that the jury had not taken full account of and acted on the evidence of the principal witnesses who had been so comprehensively examined and cross-examined upon all the material issues in the case."", 'The case had been an entirely appropriate one for a jury and had duly been tried by a jury. In this connection Sir Stephen noted that at a preliminary stage, when Lord Aldington had asked for the case to be tried by a judge alone, the applicant had resisted his application.', 'The new evidence adduced by the applicant did not carry any weight in the light of all the evidence which had been given at the trial.', ""The applicant's submission that Lord Aldington was supported by Sun Alliance Insurance Company was irrelevant."", 'In the result, on the issue of liability there was no merit in the appeal.', 'Sir Stephen Brown added:', '""The quantum of damage is a very large sum. However, there is no doubt that the learned judge gave an impeccable direction on damages. [The applicant] has argued that the judge invited the jury to give excessive damages. A correct reading of the transcript shows that he did just the opposite. There is no merit in that submission.', ""The award was entirely within the jury's discretion and they received a very full direction about it. I have no doubt that it was meant to mark their view of the enormity of the gross libel which had been published and persisted in."", '[The applicant] has however made it clear that he is not really interested so much in the question of the amount of damages as in the issue of liability. He wishes to continue to pursue Lord Aldington if he can and to persist in his allegation at a new trial. In fact he was offered a substantial reduction in the damages to the extent of £1.2 million. This he rejected. This move was not a concession by the plaintiff\'s solicitors that the award was too high, but was made recognising that the plaintiff was unlikely to receive the amount awarded and was content with the fact that the jury had by their verdict rejected in an overwhelming manner the truth of the libel which had been published.""', '(b) Lord Justice Russell', '""The court will be very slow to interfere with the jury\'s verdict unless there has been some material irregularity in the proceedings which renders the verdict unsafe or unsatisfactory, or it can properly be said that the verdict is perverse. Much the same considerations must apply in the instant case.', 'As to any irregularity in the proceedings, I detect none ...', ""This case, and the jury's verdict, depended essentially upon the veracity of Lord Aldington. No document or documents were produced which on their face could destroy Lord Aldington's credibility. If the jury had disbelieved Lord Aldington, there would have been an end of his case. The fact that the jury found in his favour and awarded him the damages that they did demonstrates that upon the vital issues of the case they must have accepted the plaintiff's evidence. Was that a course which was open to the jury? In my judgment, it plainly was ..."", ""There is not in my judgment the remotest chance of the Court of Appeal interfering with the jury's finding in the plaintiff's favour and directing a retrial of that issue, either on the basis that the verdict cannot stand or on the basis of fresh evidence which [the applicant] seeks to introduce."", '...', 'Finally, upon the issue of damages, [the applicant] had been offered in an open letter the substitution of £300,000 for the one and a half million pounds awarded by the jury. The libel remains as serious a libel as it is possible to imagine. Any appeal upon quantum alone would be no more than an academic exercise. [The applicant] wishes to reopen the whole case. In my judgment, the defendant being impecunious, justice demands that he should provide security for the plaintiff\'s costs of any appeal.""', '(c) Lord Justice Beldam', '""It would be difficult to conjecture an allegation more calculated to bring the respondent into the hatred and contempt of his fellow men and the evidence showed that it was deliberately circulated with the aim of encouraging the respondent to sue him, thus giving the appellant the opportunity to challenge in public the respondent\'s conduct 45 years ago ...', 'It is not for this court to grant a retrial after the verdict of a jury, even if it thought that a reasonable jury ought to have found differently. The test which, on the hearing of the appeal, this court would have to apply is whether the finding of the jury is so absolutely unreasonable that it can be said that they have not performed the judicial duty cast upon them. Again I have listened to the skilful development of the facts and evidence by the appellant. He has failed to satisfy me that he has any reasonable chance of success in this appeal. Even if he persuaded the court to grant a retrial on the issue of the amount of the damages, I would regard as negligible the prospect of any jury, doing their judicial duty, awarding the respondent [Lord Aldington] less than the sum which he has in reality already offered to accept in compromise of this appeal. The appellant has therefore failed to satisfy me that he has any such real and substantial grounds of appeal as would justify this court in saying that the special circumstances of his inability to pay the respondent\'s costs if he fails can be disregarded.""', ""18. The Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to provide security for Lord Aldington's costs in respect of the appeal in the sum of £124,900 within fourteen days, failing which the appeal would stand dismissed. It rejected a request by the applicant for more than fourteen days to attempt to raise the money. In addition the Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to pay Lord Aldington's costs (£22,000) in the security for costs proceedings. The judgment runs to twenty-three pages."", 'The applicant did not furnish the required security and his appeal was dismissed on 3 August 1990.', '19.

He also sought damages and other relief. Lord Aldington applied to strike out the action as an abuse of process and as being vexatious and frivolous.', ""By judgment of 14 October 1994, Mr Justice Collins struck the case out as being an abuse of the process of the court, on the ground that the applicant was unable to establish a reasonable possibility that the new evidence might show that Lord Aldington had committed perjury. In a judgment of 30 November 1994 Mr Justice Collins ordered the applicant's solicitors, who had funded the new action by acting without a fee, to pay 60% of Lord Aldington's costs in the proceedings. An appeal by the applicant to the Court of Appeal is pending.""]","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. Liability and damages in defamation cases', ""21. Under English law the actions of libel and slander are private legal remedies, the object of which is to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation and to make reparation for the injury done by the wrongful publication to a third person or persons of defamatory statements concerning the plaintiff. The defendant in these actions may prove the truth of the defamatory matter and thus show that the plaintiff has received no injury. Although there may be damage accruing from the publication if the facts published are true, the law gives no remedy by action (see Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, vol. 28, paragraph 1)."", '22. A strict liability rule applies to the tort of libel: ""A man in good faith may publish a libel believing it to be true, and it may be found by the jury that he acted in good faith believing it to be true, but that in fact the statement was false. Under those circumstances he has no defence to the action, however excellent his intention."" (Lord Loreburn LC in Hulton v. Jones [1910] Appeal Cases 20 (House of Lords), at pp. 23-24)', ""The law presumes in the plaintiff's favour that the words are false, unless and until the defendant proves to the contrary ( Gatley, Libel and Slander, Eighth Edition, paragraph 5, p. 6)."", 'If the defendant attempts unsuccessfully to prove that the words are true, this is likely to increase the damages (Duncan and Neill on defamation, Second Edition, paragraph 18.14, p. 129).', ""23. The purpose of damages in the law of libel is as stated by Lord Hailsham in Broome v. Cassell & Co. Ltd ([1972] Appeal Cases 1027, at p. 1071, quoted by Lord Donaldson in Sutcliffe v. Pressdram Ltd [1991] 1 Queen's Bench 153, p. 189):"", '""In actions of defamation and in any other actions where damages for loss of reputation are involved, the principle of restitutio in integrum has necessarily an even more highly subjective element. Such actions involve a money award which may put the plaintiff in a purely financial sense in a much stronger position than he was before his wrong. Not merely can he recover the estimated sum of his past and future losses, but, in case the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, he must be able to point to a sum awarded by a jury sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge. `... [A] man defamed does not get compensation for his damaged reputation. He gets damages because he was injured in his reputation, that is simply because he was publicly defamed. For this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done.\' ... Quite obviously, the award must include factors for injury to the feelings, the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology, or the reaffirmation of the truth of the matters complained of, or the malice of the defendant ...""', 'B. Functions of judge and jury in the High Court in defamation cases', '24. If the words in question are reasonably capable of being understood in a defamatory sense, the judge must leave it to the jury to say whether they did, in fact, defame the plaintiff. If not, he must give judgment for the defendant without leaving the case to the jury.', 'The proper course to adopt for the judge in civil proceedings for libel or slander, or criminal proceedings, where there is a case to go to the jury, is to define what is libel in point of law, and leave it to the jury to decide as a matter of fact whether the particular publication falls within that definition or not.', ""The assessment of damages is peculiarly the province of the jury, and the judge, unless sitting alone, must not himself decide the amount. He should direct the jury as to the relevant factors, such as the extent of publication, the degree to which the words would be believed or the range of persons having special knowledge needed to perceive an innuendo meaning, the position and standing of the plaintiff, the conduct of the plaintiff and of the defendant and all the circumstances of the case (see Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, vol. 28, paragraphs 225, 227 and 232)."", '25. There is no upper or lower limit to the sum of damages which a jury in a libel trial may award. In the above -mentioned case of Sutcliffe v. Pressdram Ltd, Lord Donaldson stressed that referring juries to other cases would confuse rather than assist the jury and that any attempt by counsel or the judge to discuss figures would lead to unhelpful overbidding and underbidding and would risk usurping the true function of the jury. However, the judge might give some guidance to a jury to assist it in appreciating the real value of very large sums of money, for example by inviting it to consider what regular income could be obtained if the sum was invested (see the above-mentioned case of Sutcliffe v. Pressdram Ltd, Lord Donaldson, p. 178; see also Lord Nourse, p. 186, and Lord Russell, pp. 190 91).', ""C. Court of Appeal's powers to review a jury's award of damages"", '26. At the relevant time, under Order 59, Rule 11, of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965, the Court of Appeal had power to set aside a High Court judgment and order a new trial. Rule 11 (1)-(3) read:', '""(1) On the hearing of any appeal the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks fit, make any such order as could be made in pursuance of an application for a new trial or to set aside a verdict, finding or judgment of the court below.', '(2) The Court of Appeal shall not be bound to order a new trial on the ground of misdirection, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to them, unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.', '(3) A new trial may be ordered on any question without interfering with the finding or decision on any other question; and if it appears to the Court of Appeal that any such wrong or miscarriage as is mentioned in paragraph 2 affects part only of the matter in controversy, or one or some only of the parties, the court may order a new trial as to that party only, or as to that party or those parties only, and give final judgment as to the remainder.', '(4) ...""', ""As to what test the Court of Appeal should apply in exercising its powers to set aside a jury's verdict on damages, Lord Kilbrandon in Broome v. Cassell & Co. Ltd ([1972] Appeal Cases 1027, p. 1135) stated that it was not sufficient for the court to conclude that the award was excessive; it had to ask whether the award could have been made by sensible people, or whether it must have been arrived at capriciously, unconscionably or irrationally."", '27. According to Rule 11 (4), as in force at the material time, the Court of Appeal had no power, in lieu of ordering a new trial, to reduce or increase the damages awarded by the jury, unless the party or parties concerned consented.', 'Since the entry into force on 1 February 1991 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, the Court of Appeal has a power under section 8 (2) of that Act to substitute its own assessment of damages for that of the jury irrespective of whether the parties agree or not. Order 59, Rule 11 (4), as amended in the light of the above section 8, provides:', '""In any case where the Court of Appeal has power to order a new trial on the ground that damages awarded by a jury are excessive or inadequate, the court may, instead of ordering a new trial, substitute for the sum awarded by the jury such sum as appears to the court to be proper, but except as aforesaid the Court of Appeal shall not have power to reduce or increase the damages awarded by a jury.""', '28. In the case of Rantzen v. Mirror Group Newspapers (1986) Ltd ([1993] 3 Weekly Law Reports, p. 953) the Court of Appeal exercised its powers under section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and under the new Order 59, Rule 11 (4). In interpreting its power to order a new trial or to substitute another award on the ground that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive, the Court of Appeal observed that the grant of an almost limitless discretion to a jury failed to provide a satisfactory measurement for deciding what is ""necessary in a democratic society"" or ""justified by a pressing social need"" for the purposes of Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The common law, if properly understood, required the courts to subject large awards of damages to a more searching scrutiny than had been customary in the past. It followed that what had been regarded as the barrier against intervention should be lowered. The question became:', '""Could a reasonable jury have thought that this award was necessary to compensate the plaintiff and to re-establish his reputation?""', 'As to what guidance the judge could give to the jury, the Court of Appeal was not persuaded that the time had come to make references to awards by juries in previous libel cases. Nor was there any satisfactory way in which awards made in actions involving serious personal injuries could be taken into account. It was to be hoped that in the course of time a series of decisions of the Court of Appeal, taken under section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, would establish some standards as to what would be ""proper"" awards. In the meantime the jury should be invited to consider the purchasing power of any award which they may make and to ensure that any award they make is proportionate to the damage which the plaintiff has suffered and is a sum which it is necessary to award him to provide adequate compensation and to re-establish his reputation.', 'The Court of Appeal concluded that although a very substantial award was clearly justified in the case, judged by any objective standards of reasonable compensation or necessity or proportionality, the award of £250,000 was excessive. It substituted the sum of £110,000.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', ""29. In his application of 18 December 1990 (no. 18139/91) to the Commission, Count Tolstoy complained that he had not had a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal as required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Moreover, invoking Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention (right to an effective remedy) initially, but subsequently relying on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the applicant further alleged that the Court of Appeal's order making his right to appeal conditional upon his paying £124,900 as security for Lord Aldington's costs gave rise to a breach of his right of access to court. Finally, he claimed that the award of £1,500,000 and injunction ordered by the High Court constituted a violation of his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention."", ""30. On 20 February 1992 the Commission declared inadmissible the complaint that the proceedings had been unfair; on 12 May 1993 it declared the remainder of the application admissible. In its report of 6 December 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31) the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of the applicant's right of access to court under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (by ten votes to five), but that there had been a breach of his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (art. 10) (unanimously). The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT', '31. At the public hearing on 21 January 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that the facts disclosed no violation of Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention in the present case.', '32. On the same occasion the applicant likewise maintained the requests to the Court stated in his memorial to decide that there had been violations of Articles 6 and 10 (art. 6, art. 10) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', '33. The applicant alleged a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which reads:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'He maintained that the quantum of the damages awarded against him could not be considered to have been ""prescribed by law"". In addition, the size of the award and the breadth of the injunction had been disproportionate to the aim of protecting Lord Aldington\'s ""reputation or rights"" and had thus not been ""necessary in a democratic society"".', ""34. The Government disputed these contentions. The Commission shared the applicant's view that the award was disproportionate but did not state any opinion on his other complaints."", ""35. The Court observes in the first place that the case before it is limited solely to a complaint concerning the amount of damages awarded and the court's injunction. In this regard it is unlike the defamation cases it has examined hitherto (see, for instance, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, pp. 24-28, paras. 34-47; the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 20-24, paras. 33-50; and the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, pp. 24-28, paras. 55-70), which have concerned either the decision determining liability alone or both that and the sanction."", 'Both the award of damages and the injunction clearly constituted an interference with the exercise by the applicant of his right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1) and this was not disputed before the Court. Such an interference entails a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", pursued an aim or aims that is or are legitimate under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" to attain the aforesaid aim or aims.', 'A. Was the award ""prescribed by law""?', '36. As regards the amount of damages awarded, the applicant complained that it was not ""prescribed by law"".', '1. General principles', '37. The expression ""prescribed by law"" in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words ""in accordance with the law"" in Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, pp. 30-31, paras. 48-49; cf. the Malone v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 31, para. 66), which have been summarised in the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden judgment of 25 February 1992 (Series A no. 226-A, p. 25, para. 75), as follows:', '""... the expression ... requires firstly that the impugned measures should have a basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law which confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference.""', 'The Court further reiterates that the word ""law"" covers not only statute but also common law (see the above-mentioned Sunday Times judgment, p. 30, para. 47).', '2. Application of the above principles', '38. The applicant did not deny that the award had a basis in domestic law. However, he complained that the law in question did not enable him to foresee to a reasonable degree that the amount would be as high as £1.5 million.', ""At English common law there was no upper or lower limit on the amount of damages. The extent to which a judge could give guidance was strictly circumscribed. No specific figures could be suggested and awards of damages in other libel cases or even in personal injury cases had to be disregarded for the purposes of comparison. Guidance could only be given to help the jury to appreciate the real value of large sums of money, for instance by inviting them to reflect on the value of a house (see paragraph 25 above). At the material time, there had been no principle recognised in English law that required the award to be proportionate to the aim of repairing the damage to the plaintiff's reputation. The jury gave no reasons for its decision and the award could be overturned by the Court of Appeal only if it was so unreasonable that it could not have been made by sensible people but must have been arrived at capriciously, unconscionably or irrationally (see paragraphs 24, 26 and 28 above)."", 'The applicant pointed out that, as a result of the above, in his case the trial judge had not directed the jury to ensure that the award was proportionate to the damage that Lord Aldington had suffered. The jury had, on the contrary, been encouraged to consider ""enormous damages"" and had been informed by the judge that ""there is no league of damages in defamation cases"" (see paragraph 11 above). The award made, although it had supposedly not included any punitive damages, had been three times the largest amount previously awarded by an English libel jury (see paragraph 12 above) and had been substantially greater than the sum that would be awarded to a plaintiff suffering permanent and extremely severe physical or mental disablement in a personal injury action. It would have been impossible for the applicant\'s legal advisers to predict that an award of the magnitude in question would be made.', ""39. The Government argued that a remedy such as the libel award made in the applicant's case needed to be flexible to accommodate the facts of each individual case, especially the facts of so exceptional a case as the present one. Only by maintaining such flexibility could the law achieve the purpose of compensation under the law of libel, namely to empower the jury to award, in the light of the relevant criteria at common law (see paragraph 23 above), the sum that it considered to be appropriate in the circumstances. In any event, it was not for the Court to assess English libel law in the abstract."", '40. The Court notes in the first place that the libel as found by the jury was of an exceptionally serious nature. Indeed, during the hearing at the High Court, counsel for the applicant and the applicant himself had accepted that, if libel were to be established, the jury would have to award a very substantial sum in damages (see paragraph 11 above).', ""41. The Court accepts that national laws concerning the calculation of damages for injury to reputation must make allowance for an open-ended variety of factual situations. A considerable degree of flexibility may be called for to enable juries to assess damages tailored to the facts of the particular case. Indeed, this is reflected in the trial judge's summing-up to the jury in the present case (see paragraph 11 above). It follows that the absence of specific guidelines in the legal rules governing the assessment of damages must be seen as an inherent feature of the law of damages in this area."", 'Accordingly, it cannot be a requirement of the notion of ""prescribed by law"" in Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention that the applicant, even with appropriate legal advice, could anticipate with any degree of certainty the quantum of damages that could be awarded in his particular case.', ""42. It is further observed that the discretion enjoyed by the jury in the assessment of damages was not unfettered. A jury was bound to take into account such factors as injury to feelings, the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology, the reaffirmation of the truth of the matters complained of, vindication of the plaintiff's reputation (see paragraph 23 above). It was for the trial judge to direct the jury on the law. In addition, the Court of Appeal had power to set aside an award, inter alia on the ground of irrationality and to order a new trial. It therefore appears that, although the principle of proportionality as such may not have been recognised under the relevant national law, decisions on awards were subject to a number of limitations and safeguards."", ""43. In jury trials, the lack of reasoning for awards of damages is the norm and is to a large extent unavoidable. The applicant's submission to the effect that the absence of reasons affected the foreseeability of a particularly high award being made in his case is thus not persuasive. Moreover, the argument could apply to any award whatever the magnitude and concerns less the size of the award than the very nature of the jury system itself."", '44. Having regard to the fact that a high degree of flexibility may be justified in this area (see paragraph 41 above), the various criteria to be taken into account by juries in the assessment of damages as well as the review exercised by the Court of Appeal, the Court reaches the conclusion that the relevant legal rules concerning damages for libel were formulated with sufficient precision. In short, the award was ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Did the award and the injunction pursue a legitimate aim?', '45. The award and the injunction clearly pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the ""reputation or rights of others"". This was not disputed.', 'C. Were the award and the injunction ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '1. The award', ""46. The applicant and the Commission were of the view that the amount of damages awarded - £1.5 million - was disproportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting Lord Aldington's reputation or rights. The applicant pointed out that, at the relevant time, judicial control over the award of damages in defamation cases had been insufficient to ensure that such awards were proportionate."", 'He further emphasised that the jury had not been directed to consider, in mitigation of damages, that the libellous criticism had concerned acts performed by Lord Aldington as a public officer acting in an official capacity, and had raised matters of very great public interest. These factors, which militated in favour of the allowance of wide limits to acceptable criticism, were not relevant under English law.', 'The jury had also been directed that an attempt to justify the allegations aggravated the damage suffered. This principle, in conjunction with the strict liability rule in libel cases, resulted in the imposition of a harsher penalty on a defendant who made his allegations in good faith but who failed to prove them to be true, than on a defendant who spoke knowing himself to be lying and did not attempt to defend his allegations (see paragraph 22 above).', '47. The Government maintained that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the amount of the award and the aim of compensating the damage done to Lord Aldington and restoring his reputation. They pointed out that Article 10 (art. 10) imposed ""duties and responsibilities"". The applicant\'s pamphlet had been false and unfair and had been expressly designed to provoke a libel action. Although no reasons had been given by the jury, it was, as noted by the Court of Appeal, obvious that the jury awarded so large a sum by way of damages because of the enormity of the libel. The Court of Appeal had been satisfied that the award of £1.5 million had been a rational response by the jury to the exceptional circumstances of the libel which they were considering. Otherwise, as amply demonstrated by its ruling in Sutcliffe v. Pressdram Ltd, the Court of Appeal would have been able to set the award aside and order a new trial.', ""The Government further submitted that in the Court of Appeal's opinion the jury had received a very full direction from the trial judge (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, as explained by the judge to the jury, it would have been inappropriate and unhelpful to the jury for him to refer to other cases, because the facts and circumstances were so different, or refer to specific sums of money, since the quantum of damages was exclusively a matter for the jury (see paragraph 11 above)."", ""In addition, before the High Court both counsel for the applicant and the applicant himself had acknowledged that if Lord Aldington won his libel action, he must receive a very substantial sum (see paragraph 11 above). In the Court of Appeal the applicant had been unconcerned about the size of the damages award and he had earlier declined Lord Aldington's offer to accept £300,000 (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). The offer remained open and the applicant could at any time reduce his liability by £1.2 million if he really wished to do so."", ""48. The Court recalls at the outset that its review is confined to the award as it was assessed by the jury, in the circumstances of judicial control existing at the time, and does not extend to the jury's finding of libel. It follows that its assessment of the facts is even more circumscribed than would have been the case had the complaint also concerned the latter."", 'In this connection, it should also be observed that perceptions as to what would be an appropriate response by society to speech which does not or is not claimed to enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention may differ greatly from one Contracting State to another. The competent national authorities are better placed than the European Court to assess the matter and should therefore enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in this respect.', ""49. On the other hand, the fact that the applicant declined to accept Lord Aldington's offer to settle for a lesser sum (see paragraph 15 above) does not diminish the United Kingdom's responsibility under the Convention in respect of the contested damages award."", 'However, the Court takes note of the fact that the applicant himself and his counsel accepted that if the jury were to find libel, it would have to make a very substantial award of damages (see paragraph 11 above). While this is an important element to be borne in mind it does not mean that the jury was free to make any award it saw fit since, under the Convention, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered.', 'The jury had been directed not to punish the applicant but only to award an amount that would compensate the non-pecuniary damage to Lord Aldington (see paragraph 11 above). The sum awarded was three times the size of the highest libel award previously made in England (see paragraph 12 above) and no comparable award has been made since. An award of the present size must be particularly open to question where the substantive national law applicable at the time fails itself to provide a requirement of proportionality.', '50. In this regard it should be noted that, at the material time, the national law allowed a great latitude to the jury. The Court of Appeal could not set aside an award simply on the grounds that it was excessive but only if the award was so unreasonable that it could not have been made by sensible people and must have been arrived at capriciously, unconscionably or irrationally (see paragraph 26 above). In a more recent case, Rantzen v. Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd, the Court of Appeal itself observed that to grant an almost limitless discretion to a jury failed to provide a satisfactory measurement for deciding what was ""necessary in a democratic society"" for the purposes of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. It noted that the common law - if properly understood - required the courts to subject large awards of damages to a more searching scrutiny than had been customary. As to what guidance the judge could give to the jury, the Court of Appeal stated that it was to be hoped that in the course of time a series of decisions of the Court of Appeal, taken under section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, would establish some standards as to what would be ""proper"" awards. In the meantime the jury should be invited to consider the purchasing power of any award which they might make and to ensure that any award they made was proportionate to the damage which the plaintiff had suffered and was a sum which it was necessary to award him to provide adequate compensation and to re-establish his reputation (see paragraph 28 above).', ""The Court cannot but endorse the above observations by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the scope of judicial control, at the trial and on appeal, at the time of the applicant's case did not offer adequate and effective safeguards against a disproportionately large award."", ""51. Accordingly, having regard to the size of the award in the applicant's case in conjunction with the lack of adequate and effective safeguards at the relevant time against a disproportionately large award, the Court finds that there has been a violation of the applicant's rights under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention."", '2. The injunction', ""52. The applicant further alleged that the injunction (see paragraph 12 above) was disproportionate to the aim of protecting Lord Aldington's reputation or rights. It was sweepingly broad and was ordered as a consequence of a verdict of the jury for which no reasons were given and which the judge had interpreted in the widest possible way. It prevented any comment on the role of Lord Aldington in relation to the handover of Cossacks and Yugoslavs, and the publication of any critical comment on the activities of 5 Corps which would reflect adversely on Lord Aldington, whether he was named or not. In the absence of a successful appeal, an application to vary or discharge the injunction could never have succeeded, given the state of English law. It constituted a permanent and serious interference with the applicant's opportunity to carry on his profession as a historian, preventing him from publishing the fruits of his research on the events in question."", 'At any rate, the injunction was disproportionate if considered together with the award, as the measures served in part the same function. The jury was not aware when it made the award that the judge would order an injunction. It was thus very likely that the award was intended not only to compensate Lord Aldington but also to deter the applicant from publishing in the future.', ""53. The Government contested these allegations. They maintained that in the light of the jury's verdict the judge had been entitled to prevent future repetition of the libel by the applicant and this had been the purpose of the injunction. Although the applicant's counsel at the trial had been given the opportunity to comment on the wording of the injunction, no objections had been made at the trial, or thereafter. The applicant had not availed himself of the possibility, which is still open to him, of asking for the injunction to be varied or discharged; nor had he lodged an appeal against it. In these circumstances the Court should not entertain the complaint."", ""As to the applicant's argument that the injunction overlapped with the damages award, the Government stressed that, whilst the former measure was aimed at preventing future injury, the latter was designed only to compensate for the past loss and to vindicate Lord Aldington's reputation."", ""54. As the Court has already observed, it is not claimed that the jury's finding of libel was incompatible with Article 10 (art. 10). The injunction was only a logical consequence of this finding and was framed precisely to prevent the applicant from repeating the libellous allegations against Lord Aldington. There is nothing to indicate that the injunction went beyond this purpose. Nor is there any other ground for holding that the measure, either taken alone or in conjunction with the award, amounted to a disproportionate interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 (art. 10)."", 'D. Recapitulation', '55. In sum, the Court concludes that the award was ""prescribed by law"" but was not ""necessary in a democratic society"" as there was not, having regard to its size in conjunction with the state of national law at the relevant time, the assurance of a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the legitimate aim pursued. Accordingly, on the latter point, there has been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). On the other hand, the injunction, either taken alone or together with the award, did not give rise to any breach of that Article (art. 10).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION', ""56. The applicant maintained, in addition, that there had been a violation of his right of access to a court as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention on account of the order by the Court of Appeal requiring him to pay £124,900 as security for Lord Aldington's costs in the appeal as a condition for the applicant's appeal to be heard by that court. In so far as is relevant Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) provides:"", '""In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ...""', '57. The Government and the Commission disagreed with the above contention.', 'A. Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)', '58. Notwithstanding the fact that the issue was not in dispute before it, the Court must ascertain whether Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable in the instant case. The previous defamation cases dealt with by the Court under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) have all concerned applicants who have sought to protect their own reputation by bringing proceedings before a court. According to established case-law, the provision (art. 6-1) applies to such proceedings, the right to enjoy a good reputation being a ""civil right"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, for instance, the Helmers v. Sweden judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 14, para. 27). Article 6 (art. 6) must also apply in relation to a defendant in such proceedings, where the outcome is directly decisive for his or her ""civil obligations"" vis-à-vis the plaintiff.', 'Accordingly, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applies to the present case.', 'B. Compliance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)', '59. The Court reiterates that the right of access to the courts secured by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may be subject to limitations in the form of regulation by the State. In this respect the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation. However, the Court must be satisfied, firstly, that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Secondly, a restriction must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, for instance, the Fayed v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 49-50, para. 65).', 'It follows from established case-law that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does not guarantee a right of appeal. Nevertheless, a Contracting State which sets up an appeal system is required to ensure that persons within its jurisdiction enjoy before appellate courts the fundamental guarantees in Article 6 (art. 6) (see, in particular, the Delcourt v. Belgium judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, para. 25). However, the manner of application of Article 6 (art. 6) to proceedings before such courts depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see, for instance, the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, para. 56; and the above-mentioned Helmers judgment, p. 15, para. 31).', ""The Court's task is not to substitute itself for the competent British authorities in determining the most appropriate policy for regulating access to the Court of Appeal in libel cases, nor to assess the facts which led that court to adopt one decision rather than another. The Court's role is to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see in particular the above-mentioned Fayed judgment, p. 55, para. 81; and, mutatis mutandis, the Edwards v. the United Kingdom judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247-B, pp. 34-35, para. 34)."", '60. The applicant submitted that the requirement that he pay £124,900 within a mere fourteen days had amounted to a total bar on his access to the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above). It had impaired the essence of his right of access to that court and was disproportionate.', 'In the first place, the court had not been prepared to allow him more than fourteen days to pay the sum and had thereby denied him any realistic opportunity to raise the money and to pursue the appeal.', ""Furthermore, it had placed on the applicant the onus of showing that he had real and substantial grounds upon which to challenge the judgment against him, rather than requiring Lord Aldington, the party seeking the order which would effectively bar the right of appeal, to show that the appeal was frivolous or had no prospect of success. Also, the Court of Appeal should not have taken into account Lord Aldington's offer to settle for a lesser sum (see paragraph 17 above)."", ""Moreover, the Court of Appeal had failed to have regard to the following factors. Legal aid was not available in libel actions, even to defendants, like the applicant, who were defending their fundamental right to freedom of expression. Lord Aldington's need for protection was diminished in that the costs in the High Court had in large part been covered by Sun Alliance Insurance Company, a well-endowed corporation (see paragraph 17 above)."", ""Finally, the fact that the case had been heard at first instance was irrelevant to the question of effective access to the Court of Appeal. Nor was it significant that it had heard arguments from the parties before concluding that security should be required; it was the Court of Appeal's decision which had evinced the lack of proportionality complained of."", ""61. The Court considers that the security for costs order clearly pursued a legitimate aim, namely to protect Lord Aldington from being faced with an irrecoverable bill for legal costs if the applicant were unsuccessful in the appeal. This was not disputed. Further, since regard was also had to the lack of prospects of success of the applicant's appeal, the requirement could also, as argued by the Government, be said to have been imposed in the interests of a fair administration of justice (see paragraph 17 above)."", ""62. Like the Government and the Commission, the Court is unable to share the applicant's view that the security for costs order impaired the very essence of his right of access to court and was disproportionate for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6)."", ""63. In the first place, the case had been heard for some forty days at first instance before the High Court, in the course of which Lord Aldington gave evidence for more than six days and was cross-examined, the applicant gave evidence for more than five days and a number of witnesses were called (see paragraphs 11 and 17 above). It is undisputed that the applicant enjoyed full access to court in those proceedings. It is true that he initially complained about their lack of fairness. However, that complaint was declared inadmissible by the Commission as being manifestly ill-founded. The Court attaches great weight to the above considerations in its assessment of the compatibility with Article 6 (art. 6) of the restrictions on the applicant's access to the Court of Appeal. Indeed, as indicated earlier, the entirety of the proceedings must be taken into account."", ""64. Admittedly, the sum required - £124,900 - was very substantial and the time-limit - fourteen days - for providing the money was relatively short. However, there is nothing to suggest that the figure was an unreasonable estimate of Lord Aldington's costs before the Court of Appeal or that the applicant would have been able to raise the money had he been given more time."", '65. According to the relevant practice in the Court of Appeal, impecuniosity was a ground for awarding security for costs of an appeal to that court, but only on certain conditions. In exercising its discretion as to whether to grant an application for such an order, the Court of Appeal would consider whether the measure would amount to a denial of justice to the defendant, in particular having regard to the merits of the appeal (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). If it had reasonable prospects of success, the Court of Appeal would be reluctant to order security for costs.', ""The disagreement between the applicant and Lord Aldington in the security for costs proceedings concerned the merits or lack of merits of the appeal. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal, with hesitation, decided that the appeal had just enough strength to allow the applicant to proceed without furnishing security for costs. This decision was subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeal because the applicant had failed to show real and substantial grounds for his appeal, both on liability and on damages. On the point of damages, the Court of Appeal observed, inter alia, that the applicant was not so interested in that issue as in the question of liability and that he had declined to accept Lord Aldington's offer to settle for £300,000. Therefore, an appeal on damages only would have been no more than an academic exercise (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above)."", 'The Court does not find that the justification given by the Court of Appeal for ordering security for costs disclosed any arbitrariness.', ""66. Moreover, the security for costs issue was first examined by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal and then heard by the court for six days (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). The Court of Appeal's decision was thus based on a full and thorough evaluation of the relevant factors (see the above-mentioned Monnell and Morris judgment, p. 25, para. 69)."", ""67. In the light of the foregoing, the Court does not find that the national authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation in setting the conditions which they did for the applicant to pursue his appeal in the Court of Appeal. It cannot be said that those conditions impaired the essence of the applicant's right of access to court or were disproportionate for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). Accordingly, there has been no violation of that provision (art. 6-1)."", 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '68. Count Tolstoy Miloslavsky sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, according to which:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Request for a ""declaratory"" judgment', '69. The applicant did not claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage but requested the Court to give a ""declaratory"" judgment that would ensure that he was liable, if at all, to pay to Lord Aldington only such damages as were necessary to provide adequate compensation and to re-establish the latter\'s reputation and that the Government would indemnify the applicant for any greater sum which he was liable to pay Lord Aldington.', '70. The Government considered that because the applicant had not paid any sums by way of compensation to Lord Aldington, no further remedy was required.', '71. The Delegate of the Commission did not offer any comments on this point.', ""72. The Court is not empowered under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention to make a declaration such as that requested by the applicant (see, for instance, the Philis v. Greece judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 27, para. 79; the Pelladoah v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 297-B, p. 36, para. 44; and the Allenet de Ribemont v. France judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 23, para. 65). Accordingly, the applicant's request under this head must be rejected."", 'B. Pecuniary damage', '73. The applicant also asked the Court to award him compensation in an appropriate amount for his loss of opportunity to earn a living as a historian by reason of the effects of the permanent injunction.', '74. The Court does not find it established that there existed a causal link between the matter found to constitute a violation (see paragraph 55 above) and any loss or damage which the applicant may have suffered as a result of the injunction. Therefore, his claim under this head must also be dismissed.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '75. The applicant further claimed reimbursement of costs and expenses, totalling 104,000 Swiss francs (CHF) and £149,878.24, in respect of the following items:', ""(a) CHF 70,000 for work (200 hours at SF 350 per hour) from December 1990 to August 1992 by Mr C.F. O'Neall (resident in Switzerland ), in connection with the preparation and filing of the initial application and written observations to the Commission;"", ""(b) CHF 22,800 in respect of expenses incurred by Mr O'Neall in travelling to London for consultation and preparation of the above written observations to the Commission;"", '(c) CHF 11,200 for telephone, fax, postage, photocopying and binding in connection with the above;', ""(d) £144,492.67 for Theodore Goddard, Solicitors, and counsel's work from August 1992 to 23 January 1995 with the applicant's written and oral pleadings to the Commission and Court;"", '(e) £2,621.40 for travel and subsistence expenses in connection with the appearances of the aforementioned representatives before the Commission and Court;', '(f) £2,764.17 for photocopying and miscellaneous expenses (including fax charges and fares) incurred between August 1992 and 23 January 1995.', '76. The Government and the Delegate were of the view that the amounts claimed under items (a) and (d) in respect of fees were excessive. The Delegate of the Commission invited the Court to consider adoption of a uniform approach, irrespective of national standards. The Government did not object to any of the other claims, although they invited the Court to take a critical look at the amount of costs claimed.', ""77. The Court will consider the above claims in the light of the criteria laid down in its case-law, namely whether the costs and expenses were actually and necessarily incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the matter found to constitute a violation of the Convention and were reasonable as to quantum. On the point raised by the Delegate of the Commission, concerning the reasonableness of lawyers' fees, the Court reiterates that it does not consider itself bound by domestic scales and practices, although it may derive some assistance from them (see the König v. Germany judgment of 10 March 1980, Series A no. 36, pp. 18-19, paras. 22-23 and 25; the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 17, para. 41; and the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 October 1983, Series A no. 67, p. 10, para. 20). On the other hand, given the great differences at present in rates of fees from one Contracting State to another, a uniform approach to the assessment of fees under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention does not seem appropriate."", ""78. Turning to the applicant's claims, the Court is not satisfied that all the costs and expenses were necessarily incurred. Considering also that the applicant has succeeded only in respect of one of his complaints under the Convention (see paragraph 55 above) and deciding on an equitable basis, it awards CHF 40,000 with respect to items (a), (b) and (c) and £70,000 with regard to items (d), (e) and (f).""]",3,gb,001-57947,1

Mrs Dorothea Vogt, a German national born in 1949, lives in Jever in the Land of Lower Saxony.', '9. After studying literature and languages at the University of Marburg/Lahn for six years, during which time she became a member of the German Communist Party (Deutsche Kommunistische Partei - ""DKP""), in November 1975 she sat the examination to become a secondary-school teacher (wissenschaftliche Prüfung für das Lehramt an Gymnasien). She did her teaching practice (Vorbereitungsdienst für das Lehramt) from February 1976 to June 1977 at Fulda in the Land of Hesse. In June 1977 she sat the second State examination to become a secondary-school teacher (zweite Staatsprüfung für das Lehramt an Gymnasien) and obtained a post from 1 August 1977 as a teacher (Studienrätin), with the status of probationary civil servant (Beamtenverhältnis auf Probe), in a State secondary school in Jever. On 1 February 1979, before the end of her probationary period, she was appointed a permanent civil servant (Beamtin auf Lebenszeit).', '10. Mrs Vogt taught German and French. In an assessment report drawn up in March 1981 her capabilities and work were described as entirely satisfactory and it was stated that she was held in high regard by her pupils and their parents and by her colleagues.', 'A. Disciplinary proceedings', '1. Before the Weser-Ems regional council', '11. After a preliminary investigation, the Weser-Ems regional council (Bezirksregierung Weser-Ems) issued an order (Verfügung) on 13 July 1982 instituting disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on the ground that she had failed to comply with the duty of loyalty to the Constitution (""duty of political loyalty"" - politische Treuepflicht) that she owed as a civil servant under section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act (Niedersächsisches Beamtengesetz - see paragraph 28 below). She had, it was said, engaged in various political activities on behalf of the DKP since the autumn of 1980 and in particular had stood as the DKP candidate in the 1982 elections to the Parliament (Landtag) of the Land of Lower Saxony.', '12. The ""indictment"" (Anschuldigungsschrift) of 22 November 1983, drawn up in connection with the disciplinary proceedings, specified eleven public, political activities that the applicant had engaged in for the DKP, such as distributing pamphlets, representing the DKP at political meetings, being a party official in a constituency and standing in the federal elections of 6 March 1983.', ""13. On 15 July 1985 the proceedings were stayed in order to widen the investigations to include further instances of the applicant's political activity that had come to light in the meantime."", '14. In a supplementary ""indictment"" of 5 February 1986 Mrs Vogt was accused of also failing to comply with her duties as a civil servant in that:', '(a) she had been a member of the ""Executive Committee"" (Vorstand) of the Bremen/North Lower Saxony regional branch (Bezirksorganisation) of the DKP since the end of 1983; and', ""(b) she had taken part in and addressed the DKP's 7th party congress, held from 6 to 8 January 1984 in Nuremberg, as Chairperson (Kreisvorsitzende) of the Wilhelmshaven/Friesland local branch of the party."", '15. After a further stay of proceedings on 23 June 1986, a second supplementary ""indictment"" was drawn up on 2 December 1986, which specified four other political activities considered incompatible with the applicant\'s civil-servant status, namely:', '(a) her candidature for the DKP in the elections to the Parliament of the Land of Lower Saxony on 15 June 1986;', '(b) the fact that she was still a member of the ""Executive Committee"" of the Bremen/North Lower Saxony regional branch of the DKP;', '(c) the fact that she was still Chairperson of the Wilhemshaven/Friesland local branch of the DKP; and', ""(d) her participation in the DKP's 8th party congress from 2 to 4 May 1986 in Hamburg as a party delegate."", '16. By an order of 12 August 1986 the Weser-Ems regional council notified the applicant that she had been temporarily suspended from her post, stating in particular as follows:', '""Although you knew the views of your superiors and the case-law of the disciplinary courts you have nevertheless, over a considerable period of time, deliberately violated your duty of oyalty. For a permanent civil servant that is anextraordinarily serious breach of duty. Civil servants, whosestatus is founded on a special relationship of trust with theState and who, by taking the oath, have vowed to uphold the lawand freedom, destroy this basis of trust, which is essential forthe continuation of their relationship with their employer[Dienstverhältnis], if they deliberately support a party whoseaims are incompatible with the free democratic constitutionalsystem. This is the position in the present case.""', '17. From October 1986 Mrs Vogt was paid only 60 per cent of her salary (Dienstbezüge).', '2. Before the Disciplinary Division of the Oldenburg Administrative Court', '18. Before the Disciplinary Division of the Oldenburg Administrative Court (Disziplinarkammer des Verwaltungsgerichts) the applicant, who by her own account has been a member of the DKP since 1972, argued that her conduct could not amount to a failure to fulfil her duties as a civil servant. By being a member of the party and carrying out activities on its behalf she had availed herself of the right of all citizens to engage in political activity. She had always carried out such activity within the law and within the limits laid down in the Constitution. Her action to promote peace within the Federal Republic of Germany and in its external relations and her combat against neo-fascism were in no way indicative of an anti-constitutional stance. The DKP, whose aims had always been wrongly alleged (but never proven) to be anti-constitutional, took part lawfully in the process of forming political opinion in the Federal Republic of Germany. Lastly, according to a report issued by a Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Office on 20 February 1987, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against civil servants on account of their political activities on behalf of a party that had not been banned breached International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 111 concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. It also violated Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention on Human Rights.', '19. In its judgment of 15 October 1987 the Disciplinary Division dismissed applications by Mrs Vogt to have the proceedings stayed and witnesses examined. The division ordered that all the ""charges"" against Mrs Vogt be dropped except those concerning her membership, as such, of the DKP and of the ""Executive Committee"" of the Bremen/North Lower Saxony regional branch, her chairing of the Wilhelmshaven branch of the DKP and her candidature in the elections to the Lower Saxony Land Parliament on 15 June 1986.', '20. On the merits, the Disciplinary Division held that the applicant had failed to comply with her duty of political loyalty and ordered her dismissal as a disciplinary measure. It granted her a sum equivalent to 75 per cent of her pension entitlement at that date, to be paid for a six-month period.', ""The division found in the first place that neither ILO Convention No. 111 nor the recommendations made in the Commission of Inquiry's report of 20 February 1987 constituted a bar to the opening of disciplinary proceedings."", ""It considered that active membership of a political party that pursued anti-constitutional aims was incompatible with a civil servant's duty of political loyalty. The DKP's aims, as described in the Mannheim programme of 21 October 1978 (see paragraph 22 below), were clearly opposed to the free democratic constitutional system of the Federal Republic of Germany. A party could be held to be anti-constitutional even if it had not been banned by the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) under Article 21 para. 2 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz - see paragraph 25 below). Through the active role which she played within the DKP the applicant had therefore clearly supported aims that were contrary to the Constitution."", ""The Disciplinary Division added that the rule, laid down in the first sentence of Article 48 para. 2 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 25 below), according to which no one may be prevented from taking office as a member of parliament, could not justify the applicant's standing as the DKP candidate in regional elections. This rule did not apply to measures, such as disciplinary proceedings, which initially had a different purpose and restricted the freedom to stand for election to, and to sit as a member of, parliament only as an indirect and unavoidable consequence of their implementation."", ""The duty of political loyalty, which admittedly restricted civil servants' fundamental rights, was one of the traditional principles of the civil service and had constitutional status by virtue of Article 33 para. 5 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 25 below). It followed that this duty took precedence over the provisions of international instruments such as the European Convention."", 'The applicant had moreover carried out her political activities despite being familiar with the case-law establishing that active membership of the DKP was incompatible with the duty of political loyalty. She must have been aware, at the latest once the Lower Saxony Disciplinary Court (Niedersächsischer Disziplinarhof) had delivered its judgment of 24 June 1985, which was published in an official education-authority circular and was brought to the attention of the applicant in person, that her conduct was in breach of her duties (pflichtwidriges Verhalten). Mrs Vogt had accordingly to be dismissed for having betrayed the relationship of trust between herself and her employer. Throughout the disciplinary proceedings she had moreover repeatedly indicated that she intended to continue her political activities for the DKP despite the warnings she had received. The fact that she had done her work satisfactorily for many years and that she had been held in high regard by her pupils and their parents alike was immaterial.', 'The Disciplinary Division finally ordered that Mrs Vogt should be paid 75 per cent of her pension allowance for a period of six months. It did so in recognition of the fact that apart from her breach of the duty of loyalty Mrs Vogt had always performed her duties unexceptionably and enthusiastically and needed some income to be protected from immediate hardship.', '3. In the Lower Saxony Disciplinary Court', '21. On 18 March 1988 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above judgment with the Lower Saxony Disciplinary Court, reiterating her previous arguments (see paragraph 18 above).', ""22. In a judgment of 31 October 1989 the Disciplinary Court dismissed Mrs Vogt's appeal and upheld the Administrative Court's judgment in all respects."", ""It pointed out that, by carrying out activities on behalf of the DKP, the applicant had breached the duty of political loyalty that she owed in accordance with Article 33 para. 5 of the Basic Law, taken together with section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act. Under those provisions, civil servants must at all times bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law and uphold that system. They must unequivocally dissociate themselves from groups who criticise, campaign against and cast aspersions on the State, its institutions and the existing constitutional system. As a result of her activities as a member of the DKP the applicant had failed to satisfy these requirements. The DKP's political aims were incompatible with that system."", ""The fact that the Constitutional Court had not banned the DKP did not prevent other courts from finding that the party was anti-constitutional, as the Federal Administrative Court and the Disciplinary Court itself had done convincingly in judgments of 1 February 1989 and 20 July 1989. An analysis of the still current Mannheim programme made by Mies and Gerns in their book on the DKP's methods and objectives (Weg und Ziel der DKP, 2nd edition, 1981) showed that the party, which aimed to establish a regime similar to that existing in the communist countries around 1980, continued to be guided by the principles of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Article 48 para. 2 of the Basic Law and the corresponding legislation of the Land of Lower Saxony securing the right to take office as a member of parliament did not set limits on the duty of political loyalty, since those provisions were not applicable to impediments resulting from disciplinary proceedings. The court held that the applicant's reference to Article 5 para. 1 of the Basic Law, which secured the right to freedom of expression, was not relevant as the provisions governing the civil service mentioned in Article 33 para. 5 of the Basic Law had to be regarded as general laws within the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 25 below). Similarly, the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that a decision by a competent authority relating to admission to the civil service did not amount to an interference with freedom of expression. The same approach applied in cases where a person had already been appointed to a permanent civil service post."", ""Mrs Vogt's conduct had been unlawful. By holding such a senior political post within the DKP, she necessarily espoused anti-constitutional aims and had therefore to be considered to be opposed to the Constitution herself, although she proclaimed her attachment to the Basic Law. It was not possible to support both systems at the same time."", ""Even though Mrs Vogt sought above all to achieve some of the DKP's short-term objectives such as reducing unemployment, promoting peace and eliminating so-called Berufsverbote (prohibitions on pursuing various occupations), this did not mean that her conduct was not culpable. The DKP's aims were admittedly not all anti-constitutional; some of them were compatible with the Basic Law. However, civil servants could not, as a means of furthering their own political objectives, make use of a party with anti-constitutional aims and help it to come to power. In this connection the Disciplinary Court referred to the following observations made by the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) in a judgment of 20 January 1987, adding that it adopted them as it was convinced that exactly the same reasoning applied to the case before it:"", '""It is admittedly possible to accept the view of the Federal Disciplinary Court [Bundesdisziplinargericht] that the official in question does not seek to change the system of government of the Federal Republic of Germany by the use of force and that this declaration cannot be dismissed as mere \'lip-service\'. It is also possible to accept his claim that he is mainly concerned with correcting what he perceives to be a discrepancy between the principles laid down in the Constitution and their application in practice in the Federal Republic of Germany and that he is profoundly sincere in his wish to establish a society that is more just, particularly in the economic sphere. However, contrary to the view taken by the Federal Disciplinary Court, this does not mean that he is entitled to see in the DKP the political grouping through which he believes he can achieve his ideal political order. It appears doubtful whether the view of the Constitution espoused by the official and described above reflects accurately the principles enshrined in the Basic Law. It is not necessary to resolve that question here. In its judgment banning the former Communist Party (KPD) (BVerfGE 5, p. 85), the Federal Constitutional Court held that not only the \'tactics of conflict\' employed by the former KPD but also the different phases of the process leading to attainment of its final objective of \'socialist rule\' [sozialistische Herrschaft], namely proletarian revolution by peaceful or violent means and the triumph of the working class ..., were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system. [It] also stated that intensive propaganda and persistent unrest aimed at establishing - even if this was not to be achieved in the near future - a political regime that was clearly contrary to the free democratic constitutional system inevitably caused direct and immediate harm to that system ... The Federal Constitutional Court thus also unquestionably held that the transitional stages of this process, which were of indefinite duration [and which the party sought to impose] through intensive propaganda and persistent unrest were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system (BVerwGE 47, pp. 365 and 374). Hence, contrary to the view taken by the Federal Disciplinary Court, the civil servant\'s assertion that he did not intend to change the Federal Republic of Germany\'s political system by violent means, which is moreover consistent with many statements made by his party, is of no legal significance (BVerwGE 76, p. 157).""', ""The court also considered that the applicant's commitment to changing the DKP's policies could not exculpate her. The political loyalty owed by civil servants entailed a duty for them to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups which criticised or cast aspersions on the State and the existing constitutional system. The attitude of civil servants who, even if they campaigned within the DKP for the renunciation of aims that were contrary to the Constitution, showed outside the party, through the political offices they held, that they unreservedly supported its programme and policy, was incompatible with such a duty. For as long as the DKP had not abandoned its anti-constitutional aims, civil servants' duty of political loyalty prevented them from actively working for it. This remained valid even where it was their intention to bring the party closer to democratic values. Moreover, during the disciplinary proceedings the applicant had declared her unconditional support for the DKP's aims, as set out in the Mannheim programme."", ""Like the Administrative Court, the Disciplinary Court found that Mrs Vogt had knowingly breached her professional obligations. Although she was aware of the case-law and her superiors' views on the subject, she had continued and even stepped up her activities on behalf of the DKP. Her dismissal had therefore been justified, since a civil servant who thus persisted in breaching her duties and refusing to see reason (unbelehrbar) was no longer capable of serving the State, which must be able to rely on its servants' loyalty to the Constitution. The court added that such a breach of duty was especially serious in the case of a teacher, who was supposed to teach the children entrusted to her care the fundamental values of the Constitution. Parents, who because of compulsory education had to send their children to State schools, were entitled to expect the State to employ only those teachers who unreservedly supported the free democratic constitutional system. The State was under a duty to dismiss teachers who played an active role in an anti-constitutional organisation."", ""The court added that a radical change in a civil servant's attitude could affect its assessment of the seriousness of professional misconduct. However, throughout the disciplinary proceedings, far from cutting down on her activities on behalf of the DKP, the applicant had in fact increased them. It followed that a more lenient disciplinary measure, aimed at persuading her to abandon her political activities within the DKP, was bound to fail. Accordingly, it was impossible to continue to employ her as a civil servant and her dismissal was inevitable. Her otherwise blameless conduct in carrying out her teaching tasks did not change the situation in any way, since the basis of trust that was essential for her to continue as a civil servant was lacking."", 'B. Proceedings in the Federal Constitutional Court', '23. On 22 December 1989 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde) with the Federal Constitutional Court.', 'Sitting as a panel of three judges, the court decided on 7 August 1990 not to entertain the constitutional complaint, on the ground that it had insufficient prospects of success.', ""In the Constitutional Court's view, the competent courts' analysis was based on the conviction that, by her membership of the DKP and her active role within that party, the applicant had breached her duties as a civil servant. This conclusion was well-founded and in no way arbitrary. After the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings, Mrs Vogt had herself stated that there was no point, section or part of the DKP's programme of which she disapproved, thus endorsing unconditionally the party's aims set out in the Mannheim programme. The disciplinary tribunals had been entitled to find that the DKP's aims were anti-constitutional, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 21 para. 2 of the Basic Law. Regard being had to the applicant's intractability in respect of her political loyalty, the disciplinary courts had rightly considered that the basis of trust necessary for Mrs Vogt to continue to work as a civil servant was lacking, despite the fact that she had declared herself to be in favour of a change in the party's policy and had otherwise carried out her teaching tasks in a way that was irreproachable. The applicant's dismissal had therefore not amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality as regards her constitutional rights. Accordingly, there had been no violation of Article 33 paras. 2, 3 and 5 of the Basic Law."", 'C. Subsequent developments', '24. From 1987 to 1991 the applicant worked as a playwright and drama teacher at the North Lower Saxony regional theatre (Landesbühne) in Wilhelmshaven.', 'From 1 February 1991 she was reinstated in her post as a teacher for the Lower Saxony education authority. The Land government had beforehand repealed the decree on the employment of extremists in the Lower Saxony civil service (Ministerpräsidentenbeschluß - also known as the Radikalenerlaß - see paragraph 32 below) and had published regulations for dealing with ""earlier cases"" (see paragraph 33 below).']","['II.

According to section 52 (2) of the Federal Civil Service Act and section 35 (1), third sentence, of the Civil Service (General Principles) Act for the Länder, ""civil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law and act to uphold it"".', '28. These provisions have been reproduced in the civil service legislation of the Länder, and in particular in section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act (Niedersächsisches Beamtengesetz), which likewise provides that ""civil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law and act to uphold it"".', '29. The Lower Saxony Disciplinary Code (Niedersächsische Disziplinarordnung) contains the following relevant provisions:', 'Article 2 para. 1', '""Under this law, measures may be taken against:', '(1) officials who have breached their professional duty while having the status of a civil servant ...""', 'Article 5 para. 1', '""The disciplinary measures shall be: ... dismissal ...""', 'Article 11 para. 1', '""Dismissal shall also entail loss of the right to a salary and of pension rights ...""', 'C. Decree on employment of extremists in the civil service', ""30. On 28 January 1972 the Federal Chancellor and the Prime Ministers of the Länder adopted the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service (Ministerpräsidentenbeschluß) (Bulletin of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany no. 15 of 3 February 1972, p. 142), which reiterated civil servants' duty of loyalty to the free democratic constitutional system and provided as follows:"", '""... civil servants\' membership of parties or organisations that oppose the constitutional system - and any support given to such parties or organisations - shall ... as a general rule lead to a conflict of loyalty. If this results in a breach of duty [Pflichtverstoß], it shall be for the employer to decide in each case what measures are to be taken.""', '31. In order to implement the decree, the Government of the Land of Lower Saxony adopted, in particular on 10 July 1972, provisions on ""political activity by applicants for civil-service posts and by civil servants directed against the free democratic constitutional system"".', '32. Similar legislation was initially adopted in all the Länder. However, from 1979 it was no longer or only partially applied; in some Länder the relevant legislation was even repealed.', 'In 1990, as part of their coalition agreement on the formation of a new Government for the Land of Lower Saxony, the Social Democrat and ""Green"" parties decided to repeal the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service; the decree was repealed by a ministerial decision of 26 June 1990.', '33. On 28 August 1990 the Land government took a number of measures relating to the treatment of ""earlier cases"", that is to say cases of persons who had been excluded from the civil service or refused admission to it on account of their political activities. The decision made it possible - and this happened in the present case (see paragraph 24 above) - for civil servants who had been dismissed following disciplinary proceedings to be reinstated in their posts, provided that they satisfied the recruitment and qualification requirements, without, however, entitling them to compensation or to arrears of salary.', 'D. Case-law on the civil service', '34. In a leading case of 22 May 1975 the Federal Constitutional Court clarified the special duty of loyalty owed by German civil servants to the State and its Constitution:', '""...', 'The tasks of a modern State administration are as varied as they are complex and they must be accomplished in an adequate, effective and prompt manner if the political and social system is to function and groups, minorities and individuals are to be able to lead a decent life. That administration must be able to count on a body of civil servants which is united and loyal, which faithfully performs its duties and is thoroughly dedicated to the State and the Constitution. If civil servants cannot be relied upon, society and State have no chance in situations of crisis.', '...', ""It is sufficient to observe that the duty of political loyalty owed by civil servants is the core of civil servants' duty of loyalty. It does not mean a duty to identify with the aims or a particular policy of the Government in power. It means being prepared to identify with the idea of the State which the official has to serve and with the free democratic constitutional order of that State based on the rule of law and social justice."", '...', 'It cannot be in the interests of the State and society to have civil servants who are entirely uncritical. It is, however, essential that a civil servant approves the State - notwithstanding its defects - and the existing constitutional order as it is in force and that he or she recognises that they merit protection, bears witness to them accordingly and is active on their behalf.', '...', 'The duty of political loyalty - loyalty to the State and to the Constitution - requires more than an attitude which while formally correct is in fact uninterested, indifferent and, at heart, distant in relation to the State and the Constitution.', 'It entails, inter alia, the duty for civil servants to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups and movements that criticise, campaign against and cast aspersions on that State, its institutions and the existing constitutional system.', '...', ""[The duty of loyalty owed by a civil servant] applies to every type of appointment in the civil service, an appointment of fixed duration, an appointment on probation and an appointment subject to revocation as well as an appointment to a permanent post. Nor can there be any difference of treatment in this respect according to the nature of the civil servant's duties."", '...', 'The fact that the Federal Constitutional Court has not exercised its power to declare a party anti-constitutional does not mean that it is impossible to have the conviction - and to express that conviction - that the party in question pursues anti-constitutional aims and must therefore be challenged in the political arena. A party which for instance advocates in its manifesto the dictatorship of the proletariat or approves recourse to force in order to overthrow the constitutional system if the conditions are right, pursues anti-constitutional aims ...', '...""', '35. In judgments of 29 October 1981 and 10 May 1984 the Federal Administrative Court held that civil servants who played an active role in the DKP, for example by holding a post in the party or by standing as its candidate in elections, would be in breach of their duty of political loyalty, because they would necessarily be identifying with the anti-constitutional aims of that party. It followed the same line of reasoning in a judgment of 20 January 1987 (see paragraph 22 above).', 'E. Report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Office', '36. In its report of 20 February 1987 the majority of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Office concluded that ""the measures taken in application of the duty of faithfulness to the free democratic basic order have in various respects not remained within the limits of the restrictions authorised by Article 1, paragraph 2, of [the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation)] Convention No. 111"". It also formulated a number of recommendations.', 'In reply to this report, the German Government maintained that the measures taken to ensure that civil servants remained loyal to the Constitution were not contrary to the relevant provisions of Convention No. 111 and that in any case the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry were not binding on the German State for the purposes of domestic law.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', ""37. Mrs Vogt's application was lodged with the Commission on 13 February 1991. Relying on Articles 10 and 11 (art. 10, art. 11) of the Convention, and on Article 14 taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10), she complained that her right to freedom of expression and to freedom of association had been infringed."", ""38. The Commission declared the application (no. 17851/91) admissible on 19 October 1992. In its report of 30 November 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion by thirteen votes to one that there had been a violation of Articles 10 and 11 (art. 10, art. 11) of the Convention and that it was unnecessary to examine the application also under Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention. The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '39. In their memorial the Government requested the Court to find ""that in this case the Federal Republic of Germany did not violate Articles 10 and 11 (art. 10, art. 11) of the Convention, [or] Article 14 taken together with Article 10 (art. 14+10)"".', '40. The applicant asked the Court', '""to find that there has been a violation of Articles 10 and 11 (art. 10, art. 11) of the Convention"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10) OF THE CONVENTION', '41. Mrs Vogt maintained that her dismissal from the civil service on account of her political activities as a member of the DKP had infringed her right to freedom of expression secured under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:', '""1. everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'A. Whether there was an interference', '42. The Government did not dispute the applicability of Article 10 (art. 10). However, at the hearing they requested the Court to re-examine this issue carefully.', '43. The Court reiterates that the right of recruitment to the civil service was deliberately omitted from the Convention. Consequently, the refusal to appoint a person as a civil servant cannot as such provide the basis for a complaint under the Convention. This does not mean, however, that a person who has been appointed as a civil servant cannot complain on being dismissed if that dismissal violates one of his or her rights under the Convention. Civil servants do not fall outside the scope of the Convention. In Articles 1 and 14 (art. 1, art. 14), the Convention stipulates that ""everyone within [the] jurisdiction"" of the Contracting States must enjoy the rights and freedoms in Section I ""without discrimination on any ground"". Moreover Article 11 para. 2 (art. 11-2) in fine, which allows States to impose special restrictions on the exercise of the freedoms of assembly and association by ""members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State"", confirms that as a general rule the guarantees in the Convention extend to civil servants (see the Glasenapp and Kosiek v. Germany judgments of 28 August 1986, Series A nos. 104, p. 26, para. 49, and 105, p. 20, para. 35). Accordingly, the status of permanent civil servant that Mrs Vogt had obtained when she was appointed a secondary-school teacher did not deprive her of the protection of Article 10 (art. 10).', ""44. The Court considers, like the Commission, that the present case is to be distinguished from the cases of Glasenapp and Kosiek. In those cases the Court analysed the authorities' action as a refusal to grant the applicants access to the civil service on the ground that they did not possess one of the necessary qualifications. Access to the civil service had therefore been at the heart of the issue submitted to the Court, which accordingly concluded that there had been no interference with the right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1) (see the previously cited Glasenapp and Kosiek judgments, p. 27, para. 53, and p. 21, para. 39)."", 'Mrs Vogt, for her part, had been a permanent civil servant since February 1979. She was suspended in August 1986 and dismissed in 1987 (see paragraphs 16 and 20 above), as a disciplinary penalty, for allegedly having failed to comply with the duty owed by every civil servant to uphold the free democratic system within the meaning of the Basic Law. According to the authorities, she had by her activities on behalf of the DKP and by her refusal to dissociate herself from that party expressed views inimical to the above-mentioned system. It follows that there was indeed an interference with the exercise of the right protected by Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.', 'B. Whether the interference was justified', '45. Such interference constitutes a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) unless it was ""prescribed by law"", pursued one or more legitimate aim or aims as defined in paragraph 2 (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"" to attain them.', '1. ""Prescribed by law""', '46. The Government agreed with the Commission that the interference had been based on section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act (see paragraph 28 above), as construed in the case-law of the relevant courts and had therefore been prescribed by law.', ""47. The applicant took the contrary view. She argued that it was in no way implicit in the duty of political loyalty required by section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act that civil servants could be dismissed, as she had been, on account of political activities. Neither the case-law nor the legislation was sufficiently clear and foreseeable on this point. As regards the case-law, the applicant sought to show that the Constitutional Court's judgment of 22 May 1975 (see paragraph 34 above) had by no means established the necessary clarity for those concerned since that judgment had been construed quite differently by the Federal Administrative Court and the Federal Labour Court. As to the legislation, the mere fact that, although the law had not been changed, she had been reinstated in 1991 (see paragraph 24 above) while still a member of the DKP showed that the formulation of the legislation was far from attaining a sufficient degree of precision. Her dismissal had in reality been based on a political decision taken by the Federal Chancellor and the Prime Ministers of the Länder in the form of the Decree of 28 January 1972 on the employment of extremists in the civil service (see paragraph 30 above)."", '48. The Court reiterates that the level of precision required of domestic legislation - which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality - depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. It is moreover primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35-36, para. 25). In this instance the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Administrative Court had clearly defined the duty of political loyalty imposed on all civil servants by the relevant provisions of federal legislation and the legislation of the Länder, including section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act (see paragraphs 26 to 28 above). They had held, inter alia, that any active commitment on the part of a civil servant to a political party with anti-constitutional aims such as the DKP was incompatible with that duty. At the material time - that is during the disciplinary proceedings at the latest - Mrs Vogt must have been aware of that case-law. She was therefore in a position to foresee the risks that she was running as a result of her political activities on behalf of the DKP and her refusal to dissociate herself from that party. Even if there was, as alleged, a divergence of opinion between the Federal Administrative Court and the Federal Labour Court - a divergence, moreover, whose existence the Court has not been able to establish - it would not have been material since the disciplinary courts had to follow and demonstrably followed the Federal Administrative Court\'s case-law. As to Mrs Vogt\'s argument based on her reinstatement, the latter measure does not warrant the conclusion that she seeks to draw from it, as the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it does not meet the requirement implied in the notion ""prescribed by law"".', 'The Court accordingly shares the view of the Government and the Commission that the interference was ""prescribed by law"".', '2. Legitimate aim', ""49. Like the Commission, the Government were of the opinion that the interference pursued a legitimate aim. The Government contended that the restriction on the freedom of expression deriving from civil servants' duty of political loyalty was aimed at protecting national security, preventing disorder and protecting the rights of others."", '50. The applicant did not express an opinion on this point.', '51. The Court notes that a number of Contracting States impose a duty of discretion on their civil servants. In this case the obligation imposed on German civil servants to bear witness to and actively uphold at all times the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law (see paragraphs 26-28 above) is founded on the notion that the civil service is the guarantor of the Constitution and democracy. This notion has a special importance in Germany because of that country\'s experience under the Weimar Republic, which, when the Federal Republic was founded after the nightmare of nazism, led to its constitution being based on the principle of a ""democracy capable of defending itself"" (wehrhafte Demokratie). Against this background the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant\'s dismissal pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', '3. ""Necessary in a democratic society""', '(a) General principles', '52. The Court reiterates the basic principles laid down in its judgments concerning Article 10 (art. 10):', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual\'s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ""democratic society"". Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10), is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see the following judgments: Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, para. 49; Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, para. 41; and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, para. 37).', '(ii) The adjective ""necessary"", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), implies the existence of a ""pressing social need"". The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ""restriction"" is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (art. 10).', '(iii) The Court\'s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 (art. 10) the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"" and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ""relevant and sufficient"" (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, p. 29, para. 50). In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the above-mentioned Jersild judgment, p. 26, para. 31).', '53. These principles apply also to civil servants. Although it is legitimate for a State to impose on civil servants, on account of their status, a duty of discretion, civil servants are individuals and, as such, qualify for the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. It therefore falls to the Court, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic State in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2). In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever civil servants\' right to freedom of expression is in issue the ""duties and responsibilities"" referred to in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim.', '(b) Application in the present case of the above-mentioned principles', '54. According to the Government, the breadth of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in the present case must be assessed with reference to the deliberate intention on the part of the Contracting States not to recognise in the Convention or its Protocols a right of recruitment to the civil service. They maintained that the conditions which a candidate for the civil service had to satisfy were closely linked to those applying to a civil servant who had already been appointed to a permanent post. The Federal Republic of Germany had a special responsibility in the fight against all forms of extremism, whether right-wing or left-wing. It was precisely for that reason and in the light of the experience of the Weimar Republic that the duty of political loyalty had been introduced for civil servants. The civil service was the cornerstone of a ""democracy capable of defending itself"". Its members could not therefore play an active role in parties, such as the DKP, that pursued anti-constitutional aims. Mrs Vogt had held senior posts in this party, whose objective at the material time had been the overthrow of the free democratic order in the Federal Republic of Germany and which received its instructions from the East German and Soviet communist parties. Even though no criticism had been levelled at the way she actually performed her duties, she had had, nevertheless, as a teacher, a special responsibility in the transmission of the fundamental values of democracy. Despite the warnings she had been given, the applicant had continually stepped up her activities within the DKP. That was why the German authorities had had no choice but to suspend her from her duties.', '55. The applicant disputed the necessity of the interference. Since the DKP had not been banned by the Federal Constitutional Court, her activities on behalf of that party, which had been the basis of the ""charges"" brought against her (see paragraph 19 above), had been lawful political activities for a lawful party and could not therefore amount to a failure to fulfil her duty of political loyalty. Compliance with that obligation had to be assessed not in terms of the abstract aims of a party, but with reference to individual conduct. From this point of view she had always been beyond reproach, both in the performance of her duties, in the course of which she had never sought to indoctrinate her pupils, and outside her professional activities, where she had never made any statement that could have been considered anti-constitutional. On the contrary, her activity within the DKP reflected her desire to work for peace both inside and outside the Federal Republic of Germany and to fight neo-fascism. She was firmly convinced that she could best serve the cause of democracy and human rights by her political activities on behalf of the DKP; requiring her to renounce that conviction on the ground that the State authorities held otherwise went against the very core of the freedom to hold opinions and to express them. In any event, the imposition of the heaviest sanction had been totally disproportionate. Moreover, the very protracted nature of the disciplinary proceedings in this case and significant differences in the way the provisions concerning civil servants\' duty of political loyalty had been applied from Land to Land showed that it could not be said that there were pressing reasons for dismissing her.', '56. The Commission essentially took the same view as the applicant. In its view what should have been decisive was whether the personal conduct and personal statements of the applicant were contrary to the constitutional order. Disciplinary punishment of such severity as dismissal had to be justified with reference to the personal attitude of the civil servant concerned.', '57. In the present case the Court\'s task is to determine whether Mrs Vogt\'s dismissal corresponded to a ""pressing social need"" and whether it was ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"". To this end, the Court will examine the circumstances of the case in the light of the situation existing in the Federal Republic of Germany at the material time.', '58. Mrs Vogt became a member of the DKP in 1972. It has not been disputed that this was known to the authorities when, in 1979, even before the end of her probationary period, she was appointed a permanent civil servant. However, after investigations into her political activities, disciplinary proceedings were opened against her in 1982 (see paragraph 11 above). These proceedings were suspended several times pending further investigations, but Mrs Vogt was eventually dismissed on 15 October 1987 for breach of her duty of political loyalty. The criticisms levelled against her concerned her various political activities within the DKP, the posts she had held in that party and her candidature in the elections for the Parliament of the Land (see paragraph 19 above).', ""The duty of political loyalty to which German civil servants are subject, as it was defined by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 22 May 1975, entails for all civil servants the duty to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups that attack and cast aspersions on the State and the existing constitutional system. At the material time the German courts had held - on the basis of the DKP's own official programme - that its aims were the overthrow of the social structures and the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of Germany and the establishment of a political system similar to that of the German Democratic Republic."", '59. The Court proceeds on the basis that a democratic State is entitled to require civil servants to be loyal to the constitutional principles on which it is founded. In this connection it takes into account Germany\'s experience under the Weimar Republic and during the bitter period that followed the collapse of that regime up to the adoption of the Basic Law in 1949. Germany wished to avoid a repetition of those experiences by founding its new State on the idea that it should be a ""democracy capable of defending itself"". Nor should Germany\'s position in the political context of the time be forgotten. These circumstances understandably lent extra weight to this underlying notion and to the corresponding duty of political loyalty imposed on civil servants.', 'Even so, the absolute nature of that duty as construed by the German courts is striking. It is owed equally by every civil servant, regardless of his or her function and rank. It implies that every civil servant, whatever his or her own opinion on the matter, must unambiguously renounce all groups and movements which the competent authorities hold to be inimical to the Constitution. It does not allow for distinctions between service and private life; the duty is always owed, in every context.', 'Another relevant consideration is that at the material time a similarly strict duty of loyalty does not seem to have been imposed in any other member State of the Council of Europe, whilst even within Germany the duty was not construed and implemented in the same manner throughout the country; a considerable number of Länder did not consider activities such as are in issue here incompatible with that duty.', ""60. However, the Court is not called upon to assess the system as such. It will accordingly concentrate on Mrs Vogt's dismissal."", 'In this connection it notes at the outset that there are several reasons for considering dismissal of a secondary-school teacher by way of disciplinary sanction for breach of duty to be a very severe measure. This is firstly because of the effect that such a measure has on the reputation of the person concerned and secondly because secondary-school teachers dismissed in this way lose their livelihood, at least in principle, as the disciplinary court may allow them to keep part of their salary. Finally, secondary-school teachers in this situation may find it well nigh impossible to find another job as a teacher, since in Germany teaching posts outside the civil service are scarce. Consequently, they will almost certainly be deprived of the opportunity to exercise the sole profession for which they have a calling, for which they have been trained and in which they have acquired skills and experience.', 'A second aspect that should be noted is that Mrs Vogt was a teacher of German and French in a secondary school, a post which did not intrinsically involve any security risks.', ""The risk lay in the possibility that, contrary to the special duties and responsibilities incumbent on teachers, she would take advantage of her position to indoctrinate or exert improper influence in another way on her pupils during lessons. Yet no criticism was levelled at her on this point. On the contrary, the applicant's work at school had been considered wholly satisfactory by her superiors and she was held in high regard by her pupils and their parents and also by her colleagues (see paragraph 10 above); the disciplinary courts recognised that she had always carried out her duties in a way that was beyond reproach (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above). Indeed the authorities only suspended the applicant more than four years after instituting disciplinary proceedings (see paragraphs 11 to 16 above), thereby showing that they did not consider the need to remove the pupils from her influence to be a very pressing one."", 'Since teachers are figures of authority to their pupils, their special duties and responsibilities to a certain extent also apply to their activities outside school. However, there is no evidence that Mrs Vogt herself, even outside her work at school, actually made anti-constitutional statements or personally adopted an anti-constitutional stance. The only criticisms retained against her concerned her active membership of the DKP, the posts she had held in that party and her candidature in the elections for the Parliament of the Land. Mrs Vogt consistently maintained her personal conviction that these activities were compatible with upholding the principles of the German constitutional order. The disciplinary courts recognised that her conviction was genuine and sincere, while considering it to be of no legal significance (see paragraph 22 above), and indeed not even the prolonged investigations lasting several years were apparently capable of yielding any instance where Mrs Vogt had actually made specific pronouncements belying her emphatic assertion that she upheld the values of the German constitutional order.', ""A final consideration to be borne in mind is that the DKP had not been banned by the Federal Constitutional Court and that, consequently, the applicant's activities on its behalf were entirely lawful."", ""61. In the light of all the foregoing, the Court concludes that, although the reasons put forward by the Government in order to justify their interference with Mrs Vogt's right to freedom of expression are certainly relevant, they are not sufficient to establish convincingly that it was necessary in a democratic society to dismiss her. Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation, the conclusion must be that to dismiss Mrs Vogt by way of disciplinary sanction from her post as secondary-school teacher was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10)."", 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11 (art. 11) OF THE CONVENTION', '62. The applicant also complained of a breach of her right to the freedom of association guaranteed under Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article (art. 11) shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.""', 'A. Whether there was an interference', '63. As was the case with Article 10 (art. 10), the Government did not contest the applicability of Article 11 (art. 11), although at the hearing they requested the Court to re-examine this issue carefully.', '64. Notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 (art. 11) must in the present case also be considered in the light of Article 10 (art. 10) (see the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, para. 57, and the Ezelin v. France judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 202, p. 20, para. 37). The protection of personal opinions, secured by Article 10 (art. 10), is one of the objectives of the freedoms of assembly and association as enshrined in Article 11 (art. 11).', '65. With reference to the principles set forth in respect of Article 10 (art. 10) (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above), Mrs Vogt, as a permanent civil servant, also qualified for the protection of Article 11 (art. 11).', 'The applicant was dismissed from her post as a civil servant for having persistently refused to dissociate herself from the DKP on the ground that in her personal opinion membership of that party was not incompatible with her duty of loyalty.', 'There has accordingly been an interference with the exercise of the right protected by paragraph 1 of Article 11 (art. 11-1).', 'B. Whether the interference was justified', '66. Such interference constitutes a breach of Article 11 (art. 11) unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 (art. 11-2), which are identical to those laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), the only exception being where the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 11 (art. 11-2) is applicable.', '67. In this respect the Court agrees with the Commission that the notion of ""administration of the State"" should be interpreted narrowly, in the light of the post held by the official concerned.', '68. However, even if teachers are to be regarded as being part of the ""administration of the State"" for the purposes of Article 11 para. 2 (art. 11-2) - a question which the Court does not consider it necessary to determine in the instant case -, Mrs Vogt\'s dismissal was, for the reasons previously given in relation to Article 10 (art. 10) (see paragraphs 51 to 60 above), disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.', 'There has accordingly also been a violation of Article 11 (art. 11).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 10 (art. 14+10)', '69. Before the Commission the applicant complained of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10), but she did not raise this complaint before the Court.', '70. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine the question of its own motion.', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '71. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', '72. Mrs Vogt submitted claims for compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and for the reimbursement of her costs and expenses.', '73. The Government and the Delegate of the Commission regarded most of the sums claimed as excessive.', ""74. In the Court's opinion, the question is not ready for decision. It is accordingly necessary to reserve it and to fix the further procedure, account being taken of the possibility of an agreement between the respondent State and the applicant (Rule 54 paras. 1 and 4 of Rules of Court A).""]",2,de,001-58012,1

Mr Francisco Velosa Barreto, a Portuguese national born in 1954, is an office worker. He married in April 1979 and he and his wife have one child, born on 7 June 1980.', ""9. When the applicant was still single he lived with his parents. Since his marriage he has lived in a house rented by his parents-in-law. One of his wife's brothers and two of her aunts have also lived there at various times in that period. The house, in Funchal ( Madeira ), has four bedrooms, a kitchen, a living-cum-dining room and a basement."", '10. In November 1982 Mr Velosa Barreto inherited from his parents a house also situated in Funchal. This house, which has been let for residential use to E.R. since 23 June 1964, has three bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. The rent, which had initially been fixed at 1,200 escudos (PTE), was PTE 1,500 at the time when the proceedings began.', '11. On 6 April 1983 the applicant and his wife brought proceedings against E.R. and his wife in the Funchal Court of First Instance. Relying on Articles 1096 and 1098 of the Civil Code, they asked the court to terminate the lease on the ground that they needed to occupy the property as their own home.', '12. The Funchal Court of First Instance found against the applicant and his wife on 13 March 1989. It held that one of the statutory requirements for termination had not been satisfied, since the applicant had not established facts which proved a real need to occupy the house himself.', 'The reasons given by the judge included the following considerations:', '""A landlord\'s need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances, his living conditions and/or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future.', ""In that connection, the following facts have already been established: that 'since his marriage, in April 1979, Mr Velosa Barreto has lived with his parents-in-law in the Travessa do Caetano, [ Funchal ]'; that 'Mrs Velosa Barreto's parents, Mr and Mrs Velosa Barreto and their son, one of Mrs Velosa Barreto's brothers and two of her aunts ... lived in the house'; that 'the plaintiffs' house has three bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom'; that 'the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor, a kitchen and a living-cum-dining room on the ground floor and a basement'; that 'Mr Velosa Barreto's parents-in-law, who are at present the sole occupants, with Mr and Mrs Velosa Barreto and their son, of the house in the Travessa do Caetano, are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son, since they have nowhere else to live'; and that 'the plaintiffs both work in Funchal '."", ""It should be noted that Mrs Velosa Barreto's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need. The plaintiffs' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought, since they even have a bedroom for their son."", ""Moreover, the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving, as the onus was on them to do, that the relations between themselves and Mrs Velosa Barreto's parents were permanently strained and conflictual. What is certain, however, is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son's illness and their living conditions in that house."", ""It might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with Mrs Velosa Barreto's parents, 'who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son, since they have nowhere else to live' - that in view of the adage 'When a man marries he needs a house', cited by Mr Velosa Barreto in his first application, the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there."", '...', 'However, each case is unique. Regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims, but not established, and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity, to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion, in the light of everyday experience, it cannot be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there.', 'Their living conditions would certainly be better and more comfortable in the house let to the defendants, but the real need required by case-law does not exist, nor is this a case where it is absolutely necessary or essential for the plaintiffs to recover possession of the accommodation.', ""It follows that, although the other conditions in Article 1098 of the Civil Code have been satisfied, the plaintiffs' application must be considered inadmissible, since they have not established that they are entitled to terminate the lease under Article 1096 para. 1 (a)."", 'In conclusion, without finding it necessary to add any further considerations, I declare unfounded, for lack of evidence, the present action for termination of the lease and eviction of the tenant ( processo especial de despejo ), and find against the plaintiffs ...""', '13. On 6 April 1989 Mr Velosa Barreto appealed against this judgment to the Lisbon Court of Appeal. Referring to the underlying intention of the legislation concerning the right to terminate a lease, he argued that he and his family had the right to live in a home they did not have to share with anyone.', ""14. On 11 October 1990 the Court of Appeal upheld the impugned judgment. It held that the house of the applicant's parents-in-law was large enough for all the people who lived in it, including the applicant, his wife and his son. There was therefore no real need for Mr Velosa Barreto to live in the house he owned."", 'The Court of Appeal gave the following reasons for its decision:', '""In order to establish need, plaintiffs must cite specific facts which, once proved, establish the existence of a real, serious and present need, adducing weighty rather than purely hypothetical arguments. It is not sufficient to desire, to wish or to claim.', '...', 'In order to be able to exercise their right [to terminate the lease], the applicants must adduce evidence of those facts (Article 342 para. 1 of the Civil Code).', '...', '... it is established that:', '(a) the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor, a kitchen and a living-cum-dining room on the ground floor and a basement;', ""(b) at present that house is occupied by Mr Velosa Barreto's parents-in-law, the plaintiffs and their son, that is five people altogether; and"", ""(c) Mr Velosa Barreto's parents-in-law are resigned to the presence in the house of the plaintiffs and their son."", 'As the house has four bedrooms, the plaintiffs can occupy one room and their son another.', 'The house has enough bedrooms for all the members of the family to be able to live there.', ""Each couple has a bedroom and the plaintiffs' son has his. And there is still one bedroom left over."", 'The judgment must reflect the situation at the conclusion of the evidence and argument (Article 663 para. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure).', ""Since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation, the fact that they live with Mrs Velosa Barreto's parents, albeit by their favour, is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by Article 1096 of the Civil Code ... Moreover, the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house."", 'Derogation from the general principle and eviction of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord are possible only where it appears to be absolutely necessary, for weighty reasons, for the landlord to live in the property (Article 1095 of the Civil Code).', 'In the light of the foregoing considerations, and because the plaintiffs have not proved need as set out above and as this court interprets it, the appeal is inadmissible and the judgment is upheld.""', '15. No appeal lay against the above judgment.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', '16. The following is a translation of the main provisions of the Civil Code applicable at the material time to the termination of tenancy contracts on residential property:', 'Article 1095', '""(General principle)', '... A landlord shall not have the right to terminate a [tenancy] contract, which shall be tacitly renewed unless terminated by the tenant in accordance with Article 1055.""', 'Article 1096', '""(Exceptions)', '1. A landlord may seek termination of a [tenancy] contract on its expiry in the following cases:', '(a) when he needs ( necessite ) the property in order to live there or to build his home there.', '...""', 'Article 1098', '""(Termination in order to occupy)', '1. The right of a landlord to seek the termination of a [tenancy] contract in order to occupy the property as his home shall be subject to the following conditions:', '(a) he must have owned ... the property for more than five years or have acquired it by inheritance, in which case this qualifying period shall not apply;', '(b) he must not have been in occupation of another residence in the area where the property covered by the [tenancy] contract is situated, either as owner or tenant, for more than one year; and', '(c) he must not previously have sought to terminate the contract.', '...""', ""17. According to established case-law (Supreme Court judgments of 15 December 1981 and 12 July 1983), a landlord's right to terminate a lease in order to occupy the property as his home may be exercised only when, in addition to the conditions laid down in Article 1098 of the Civil Code, the condition laid down in Article 1096 para. 1 (a), namely the landlord's real need to live in the property, has been satisfied."", '18. These rules were amended by the legislative decree of 15 October 1990, but this did not introduce any fundamental change regarding the possibility of termination.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '19. Mr Velosa Barreto applied to the Commission on 31 March 1991. He complained of a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention on account of the impossibility of recovering possession of the house he owned in order to live in it with his family.', ""20. The Commission (Second Chamber), examining the complaint of its own motion from the standpoint of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), declared the application (no. 18072/91) admissible on 12 January 1994. In its report of 29 June 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion by nine votes to three that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) and by nine votes to three that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]."", 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) OF THE CONVENTION', '21. Mr Velosa Barreto alleged that the Portuguese courts, by not allowing him to terminate the lease on the house he owned, had infringed his right to respect for his private and family life. He relied on Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', 'The applicant claimed that it was implicit in Article 8 (art. 8) that each family had the right to a home for themselves alone. He complained in particular of the obstacles that had been placed in the way of his pursuit of a satisfactory private and family life, since his living conditions and surroundings should have been improved. He had thus been prevented from availing himself of an essential means of developing a fulfilling private and family life. His child had never had the advantage of growing up in complete privacy with his parents, and had remained an only child because of the cramped living conditions.', '22. The Government contended that Mr Velosa Barreto could not be considered to have suffered an ""interference"" in the exercise of his right to respect for his private and family life. He was not complaining in substance of an act which could constitute interference but merely expressing his disagreement with the view the courts had taken of the facts of the case. The applicant\'s family circumstances had not been altered in any way. Moreover, the State was under no positive obligation. It followed that Article 8 (art. 8) was not applicable.', '23. The Court reiterates that, although the object of Article 8 (art. 8) is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it may also give rise to positive obligations (see the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 17, para. 32), particularly the obligation to ensure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of interpersonal relations (see the X and Y v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, para. 23). In this matter as in others a fair balance must be struck between the general interest and the interests of the people concerned (see, among other authorities, the B. v. France judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 232-C, p. 47, para. 44, and the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, para. 49).', '24. The Court recognises that the decisions complained of prevented Mr Velosa Barreto from living in his house, as he intended. Nevertheless, effective protection of respect for private and family life cannot require the existence in national law of legal protection enabling each family to have a home for themselves alone. It does not go so far as to place the State under an obligation to give a landlord the right to recover possession of a rented house on request and in any circumstances.', '25. Like the Commission, the Court considers that the legislation applied in this case pursues a legitimate aim, namely the social protection of tenants, and that it thus tends to promote the economic well-being of the country and the protection of the rights of others.', '26. It is not in dispute that, in pursuit of those aims, the Portuguese legislature was entitled to make termination of a lease subject to the condition that the landlord ""needs the property in order to live there"" (see paragraph 16 above).', ""The only point at issue is whether, in applying the above rule to the applicant's case, the Portuguese courts infringed his right to respect for his private and family life."", '27. Mr Velosa Barreto asserted that the Portuguese authorities had not endeavoured to strike a balance between the general interest and his own interests. The assessment of need had been based solely on the fact that he lived with his parents-in-law, whose house had been adjudged large enough to accommodate his family. The judge had thus ignored the precarious and unstable situation, whose continuation depended on the goodwill and hospitality of others. With regard to the housing shortage alleged to exist in Funchal, a point which the Government had raised for the first time before the Court, the various censuses showed that there had been no such shortage while the proceedings were pending. In addition, there was no evidence to support the contention that termination of the lease would have had dramatic consequences for the tenants.', '28. According to the Government, a balancing exercise between the respective interests is carried out by the courts. Determination of the existence of ""need"" lay entirely within the national authorities\' margin of appreciation, and they had settled the dispute in accordance with criteria established by case-law and based on the principle of proportionality, the good faith of the judiciary and the social consensus. The Portuguese courts, who had direct knowledge of the relevant circumstances, were clearly better placed than the European Court to assess the facts at a given time and place.', '29. The Court notes that the Funchal Court of First Instance and the Lisbon Court of Appeal held that in the circumstances of the case existence of the ""need"" required by law had not been proved.', ""Each of those courts reached that conclusion after duly considering the various questions of fact and of law submitted to it and conducting a careful analysis of the arguments put forward by the applicant, which it then set out at length and in detail in the reasons for its decision. In particular, both courts took account of the fact that Mr Velosa Barreto's situation had improved during the proceedings, since two of his wife's aunts and her brother had in the meantime left the house he was living in, leaving more room for his own household."", '30. It has not been shown, and there is no evidence to suggest, that by ruling as they did the Portuguese courts acted arbitrarily or unreasonably or failed to discharge their obligation to strike a fair balance between the respective interests.', '31. Accordingly, the Court considers that the right guaranteed by Article 8 (art. 8) has not been infringed.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 (P1-1)', '32. The applicant maintained that the judgments in issue, by preventing the family from occupying the house they owned, were in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), which provides:', '""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.""', '33. The Government contended that Mr Velosa Barreto had not cited any fact which could be construed as an infringement of his right of property. No intervention capable of infringing that right could be held against the Portuguese authorities. The applicant had been bound by the terms of a lease concluded by his father when he was the owner of the house. Even supposing that the right of property was in issue, legislation restricting freedom of contract in respect of tenancies of residential property had to be considered control of the use of property, within the meaning of the second paragraph of the Article (P1-1) concerned.', '34. The Commission concluded that there had been no violation of that Article (P1-1).', ""35. The Court finds that the restriction on the applicant's right to terminate his tenant's lease constitutes control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). That restriction, as the Court has already held (see paragraph 25 above), pursued a legitimate social policy aim."", ""36. For the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to be satisfied, such an interference must strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights (see, among other authorities, the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, para. 69, and, as the most recent authority, the Scollo v. Italy judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 15-C, p. 53, para. 32)."", '37. The Court observes in that connection that Mr Velosa Barreto did not rely on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) in his application; the Commission raised that provision (P1-1) of its own motion in its decision on admissibility (see paragraph 20 above). The Court notes that the applicant did not subsequently present argument in support of this complaint.', ""For the rest, it refers to its considerations relating to the alleged infringement of the applicant's right to respect for his private and family life (see paragraphs 29-30 above), which are also applicable to his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions."", '38.

The applicant is a British citizen. His relationship with his wife, whom he married in 1987, was turbulent and came under great strain in 1990 when he became unemployed. In the early evening of 18 September 1990, she told him that for some weeks she had been thinking of leaving him and that she regarded the marriage as over. Prior to that date they had been sleeping separately - according to the applicant, for one night, or according to his wife, for five nights. The applicant did not accept that his wife meant what she said and they had a row following which he ejected her from the house, bruising her arm. She went to her next door neighbours and called the police, who subsequently visited and spoke to both the applicant and his wife separately. Later the same evening she re-entered the house and the applicant had sexual intercourse with her. Shortly afterwards she left the house, having first tried to take their child with her. She went to the neighbours crying and distressed, complaining to them and to the police, whom she telephoned, that she had been raped at knife-point.', '9. On 19 September 1990 the applicant was charged with rape, under section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956; threatening to kill, contrary to section 16 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861; and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, in breach of section 47 of the latter Act.', 'B. Crown Court judgment of 30 July 1990 and Court of Appeal judgment of 14 March 1991 in the case of R. v. R.', '10. On 30 July 1990 the defendant in another case, R. v. R., had been sentenced to three years ’ imprisonment by the Crown Court for attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife. The trial judge, Mr Justice Owen, had rejected the defendant ’ s submission that he could not be convicted in light of a common law principle stated by Sir Matthew Hale CJ in his History of the Pleas of the Crown published in 1736:', '""But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.""', 'In his judgment ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports, 747) Mr Justice Owen noted that it was a statement made in general terms at a time when marriage was indissoluble. Hale CJ had been expounding the common law as it seemed to him at that particular time and was doing it in a book and not with reference to a particular set of circumstances presented to him in a prosecution. The bald statement had been reproduced in the first edition of Archbold on Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice (1822, p. 259) in the following terms: ""A husband also cannot be guilty of rape upon his wife.""', 'Mr Justice Owen further examined a series of court decisions (R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen ’ s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 113; R. v. Clarke [1949] 2 All England Law Reports 448; R. v. Miller [1954] 2 All England Law Reports 529; R. v. Reid [1972] 2 All England Law Reports 1350; R. v. O ’ Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663; R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22; R. v. Roberts [1986] Criminal Law Reports 188; see paragraphs 22-25 below), recognising that a wife ’ s consent to marital intercourse was impliedly given by her at the time of marriage and that the consent could be revoked on certain conditions. He added:', '""I am asked to accept that there is a presumption or an implied consent by the wife to sexual intercourse with her husband; with that, I do not find it difficult to agree. However, I find it hard to ... believe that it ever was the common law that a husband was in effect entitled to beat his wife into submission to sexual intercourse ...', 'If it was, it is a very sad commentary on the law and a very sad commentary upon the judges in whose breasts the law is said to reside. However, I will nevertheless accept that there is such an implicit consent as to sexual intercourse which requires my consideration as to whether this accused may be convicted for rape.""', 'On the question of what circumstances would suffice in law to revoke the consent, Mr Justice Owen noted that it may be brought to an end, firstly, by a court order or equivalent. Secondly, he observed, it was apparent from the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment in the case of R. v. Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties. Such an agreement could clearly be implicit; there was nothing in the case-law to suggest the contrary. Thirdly, he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated, would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent. He concluded that both the second and third exceptions to the matrimonial immunity against prosecution for rape applied in the case.', '11. An appeal to the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, was dismissed on 14 March 1991 ([1991] 2 All England Law Reports 257). Lord Lane noted that the general proposition of Sir Matthew Hale in his History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736) (see paragraph 10 above) that a man could not commit rape upon his wife was generally accepted as a correct statement of the common law at that epoch. Further, Lord Lane made an analysis of previous court decisions, from which it appears that in R. v. Clarence (1888), the first reported case of this nature, some judges of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle. In the next reported case, R. v. Clarke (1949), the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband ’ s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him. Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity (see paragraph 24 below). The Court of Appeal had accepted in R. v. Steele (1976) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Roberts (1986), where it held that the lack of a non-molestation clause in a deed of separation, concluded on expiry of a non-molestation order, did not revive the consent to intercourse.', 'Lord Lane added the following observations:', '""Ever since the decision of Byrne J in R. v. Clarke in 1949, courts have been paying lip-service to Hale CJ ’ s proposition, whilst at the same time increasing the number of exceptions, the number of situations to which it does not apply. This is a legitimate use of the flexibility of the common law which can and should adapt itself to changing social attitudes.', 'There comes a time when the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour.', '...', 'It seems to us that where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in present-day society, the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so in the light of any relevant parliamentary enactment. That in the end comes down to a consideration of the word ‘ unlawful ’ in the 1976 Act.""', 'Lord Lane then critically examined the different strands of interpretation of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act (see paragraph 20 below) in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape. He concluded:', '""... [W]e do not consider that we are inhibited by the 1976 Act from declaring that the husband ’ s immunity as expounded by Hale CJ no longer exists. We take the view that the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim.', 'The remaining and no less difficult question is whether, despite that view, this is an area where the court should step aside to leave the matter to the parliamentary process. This is not the creation of a new offence, it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it.', 'Had our decision been otherwise and had we been of the opinion that Hale CJ ’ s proposition was still effective, we would nevertheless have ruled that where, as in the instant case, a wife withdraws from cohabitation in such a way as to make it clear to the husband that so far as she is concerned the marriage is at an end, the husband ’ s immunity is lost.""', '12. On 23 October 1991, on a further appeal by the appellant in the above case, the House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment, declaring, inter alia, that the general principle that a husband cannot rape his wife no longer formed part of the law of England and Wales. It stressed that the common law was capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Whilst Sir Matthew Hale ’ s proposition had reflected the state of affairs at the time it was enunciated, the status of women, and particularly of married women, had changed out of all recognition in various ways. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes had been that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband (R. v. R. [1991] 4 All England Law Reports 481).', '13. On 31 March 1992 the above appellant R. brought an application (no. 20190/92) to the Commission. The Commission referred his application (C.R. v. the United Kingdom ) to the Court on the same date as the present case (see paragraphs 1 and 3 above).', 'C. The trial of the applicant in the present case', '14. At the commencement of his trial on 16 April 1991, the applicant submitted that there was no case to answer on the rape charge. In the first place, he argued that the trial judge, Mr Justice Rose, should follow the Court of Appeal ’ s approach in the case of R. v. Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) and should not consider himself bound by the 14 March 1991 judgment of that court in R. v. R. in so far as it purported to change the principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife. Secondly, he maintained that the retrospective effect of the change in the law effected by R. v. R. should be pronounced incompatible with Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention. He referred, inter alia, to the judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in R. v. Kent Kirk (European Court Reports [1984] 2689), dealing with a penal provision in relation to fishing, which was allegedly imposed retroactively.', '15. With regard to the applicant ’ s first submission, Mr Justice Rose held on 18 April 1991 that he considered himself bound by the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment in R. v. R. He was not persuaded that there was a conflict between the ratios of that decision and the judgment in R. v. Steele. Moreover, the decision in R. v. R. was not reached in ignorance of R. v. Steele but had regard to the latter.', 'With regard to the applicant ’ s second submission, Mr Justice Rose observed:', '""... I shall assume for the purpose of the present argument that the effect of Kirk is via the Treaty of Rome and the decision of the [Court of Justice of the European Communities] to render Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) part of English law. However, it seems to me that the effect of Article 7 para. 2 (art. 7-2) is to prevent reliance by the defendant on Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1).', 'Furthermore, ... a succession of cases ... in which the [Court of Justice] ... has developed the principle of protection of fundamental rights in cases concerning economic and financial matters ... it seems to me in so far as they touch upon the matter at all, and it is accepted that they do not deal with criminal offences of the kind with which I am concerned, no doubt preserve the fundamental right of a woman not to have non-consensual sexual intercourse forced upon her.', 'Furthermore, the nature of the common law, developing as it does from judicial decision to judicial decision, but being deemed to be always that which it is currently declared to be, is such that if Article 7 (art. 7) is part of English law, Article 7 para. 2 (art. 7-2) is not incompatible with that common law approach. Non-consensual sexual intercourse is in English law, as no doubt it is in the legal systems of many civilised nations, ... a criminal offence. In so far as there was by the end of the 19th Century in English law ... a matrimonial exception, that matrimonial exception has, particularly over the last 30 or 40 years, been whittled away by judicial decision to the extent that ... it no longer exists. It seems to me that to say that in these circumstances this defendant is in the terms of Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) at risk of conviction in relation to conduct ‘ which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed ’ is or would be an abuse of language. Accordingly, [counsel for the applicant ’ s] second submission fails ... Having regard to the conclusions which I have reached ... there is, in my judgment, a case to answer.""', '16. On 19 April 1991 the applicant was found guilty by the jury of all three offences (see paragraph 9 above). He was sentenced to a total of five years ’ imprisonment: five years for rape, two years for making a threat to kill and three months for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm - the sentences of two years and three months were expressed to run consecutively to each other but concurrently with the five-year sentence.', '17. The applicant lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence in which he repeated the submissions set out in paragraph 14 above.', '18. In view of the House of Lords ’ ruling of 23 October 1991 in R. v. R. (see paragraph 12 above) the applicant was advised by his lawyers on 3 January 1992 that his appeal against conviction offered no prospect of success. He therefore withdrew his appeal against conviction on 15 January 1992. His appeal against sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 30 July 1992.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. The offence of rape', '19. The offence of rape, at common law, was traditionally defined as unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent by force, fear or fraud. By section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, ""it is a felony for a man to rape a woman"".', '20. Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows:', '""For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if', '- (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...""', '21. On 3 November 1994 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 replaced the above provisions by inserting new subsections to section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, one of the effects of which was to remove the word ""unlawful"":', '""1. (1) It is an offence for a man to rape a woman or another man.', '(2) A man commits rape if - (a) he has sexual intercourse with a person ... who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...""', 'B. Marital immunity', '22. Until the case of R. v. R. the English courts, on the few occasions when they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage. The proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above (see paragraph 10) has been reaffirmed until recently, for example in the case of R. v. Kowalski ([1987] 86 Criminal Appeal Reports 339), which concerned the question whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault. Mr Justice Ian Kennedy, giving the judgment of the court, stated, obiter:', '""It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife.""', 'And he went on to say that that principle was', '""dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement"".', 'In another example, Lord Justice O ’ Connor in the R. v. Roberts case ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188) held:', '""The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.""', '23. However, on 5 November 1990, Mr Justice Simon Brown held in R. v. C. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 755) that the whole concept of marital exemption in rape was misconceived:', '""Were it not for the deeply unsatisfactory consequence of reaching any other conclusion on the point, I would shrink, if sadly, from adopting this radical view of the true position in law. But adopt it I do. Logically, I regard it as the only defensible stance, certainly now as the law has developed and arrived in the late twentieth century. In my judgment, the position in law today is, as already declared in Scotland, that there is no marital exemption to the law of rape. That is the ruling I give.""', 'On the other hand, on 20 November 1990, in R. v. J. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 759) Mr Justice Rougier upheld the general common law rule, considering that the effect of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act was that the marital exemption embodied in Hale ’ s proposition was preserved, subject to those exceptions established by cases decided before the Act was passed. He further stated:', '""... there is an important general principle to be considered here, and that is that the law, especially the criminal law, should be clear so that a man may know where he stands in relation to it. I am not being so fanciful as to suppose that this defendant carefully considered the authorities and took Counsel ’ s advice before behaving as alleged, but the basic principle extends a long way beyond the bounds of this case and should operate to prevent a man being convicted by means of decisions of the law ex post facto.""', 'On 15 January 1991, Mr Justice Swinton Thomas in R. v. S. followed Rougier J, though he considered that it was open to judges to define further exceptions. Both Rougier and Swinton Thomas JJ stated that they regretted that section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act precluded them from taking the same line as Simon Brown J in R. v. C.', '24. In its Working Paper 116 ""Rape within Marriage"" completed on 17 September 1990, the Law Commission stated:', '""2.8 It is generally accepted that, subject to exceptions (considered ... below), a husband cannot be convicted of raping his wife ... Indeed there seems to be no recorded prosecution before 1949 of a husband for raping his wife ...', '...', '2.11 The immunity has given rise to a substantial body of law about the particular cases in which the exemption does not apply. The limits of this law are difficult to state with certainty. Much of it rests on first instance decisions which have never been comprehensively reviewed at appellate level ...""', 'The Law Commission identified the following exceptions to a husband ’ s immunity:', '- where a court order has been made, in particular:', '(a) where an order of the court has been made which provides that a wife should no longer be bound to cohabit with her husband (R. v. Clarke [1949] 33 Criminal Appeal Reports 216);', '(b) where there has been a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi of divorce on the ground that ""between the pronouncement of decree nisi and the obtaining of a decree absolute a marriage subsists as a mere technicality"" (R. v. O ’ Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663);', '(c) where a court has issued an injunction restraining the husband from molesting the wife or the husband has given an undertaking to the court that he will not molest her (R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22);', '(d) in the case of R. v. Roberts ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188), the Court of Appeal found that where a non-molestation order of two months had been made in favour of the wife her deemed consent to intercourse did not revive on expiry of the order;', '- where no court order has been made:', '(e) Mr Justice Lynskey observed, obiter, in R. v. Miller ([1954] 2 Queen ’ s Bench Division 282) that a wife ’ s consent would be revoked by an agreement to separate, particularly if it contained a non-molestation clause;', '(f) Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane stated, obiter, in R. v. Steele that a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause would have that effect.', '25. The Law Commission noted that it was stated in R. v. Miller and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Steele that lodging a petition for divorce would not be sufficient.', 'It referred also to the ruling by Mr Justice Owen in the case of R. v. R. where an implied agreement to separate was considered sufficient to revoke the immunity and that, even in the absence of agreement, the withdrawal from cohabitation by either party, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, would operate to exclude the immunity. It found this view difficult to reconcile with the approach in Steele that filing a divorce petition was ""clearly"" not sufficient. The ruling in R. v. R. appeared substantially to extend what had previously been thought to be the law, although it emphasised that factual separation, and not mere revocation of consent to intercourse, was necessary to remove the immunity.', '26. The Law Commission pointed out that its inquiry was unusual in one important respect. It was usual practice, when considering the reform of common law rules, to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law, in order to analyse whether those grounds were well-founded. However, that step was of little assistance here, not only because there was little case-law on the subject but also, and in particular, because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported (paragraph 4.1 of the Working Paper). The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife ’ s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir Mathew Hale in his dictum. This notion was not only quite artificial but, certainly in the modern context, was also quite anomalous. Indeed, it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable. The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage (paragraph 4.2).', 'The concept of deemed consent was artificial because the legal consequences of marriage were not the result of the parties ’ mutual agreement. Although the parties should have legal capacity to enter into the marriage contract and should observe the necessary formalities, they were not free to decide the terms of the contract; marriage was rather a status from which flow certain rights or obligations, the contents of which were determined by the law from time to time. This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice Hawkins in R. v. Clarence (1888) when he said: ""The intercourse which takes place between husband and wife after marriage is not by virtue of any special consent on her part, but is mere submission to an obligation imposed on her by law"" (paragraph 4.3).', 'In this connection, the Law Commission stressed that ""[t]he rights and duties arising from marriage have, however, changed over the years as the law has adapted to changing social conditions and values. The more modern view of marriage is that it is a partnership of equals"" (paragraph 4.4). It then gave examples of such changes in the law and added:', '""4.11 This gradual recognition of mutual rights and obligations within marriage, described in paragraphs 4.3-4.10 above, in our view demonstrates clearly that, whatever other arguments there may be in favour of the immunity, it cannot be claimed to be in any way justified by the nature of, or by the law governing, modern marriage.""', '27. The Law Commission made, inter alia, the provisional proposal that ""the present marital immunity be abolished in all cases"" (paragraph 5.2 of the Working Paper).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '28. In his application of 29 March 1992 (no. 20166/92) to the Commission, the applicant complained that, in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, he was convicted in respect of conduct, namely the rape upon his wife, which at the relevant time did not, so he submitted, constitute a criminal offence.', '29. The Commission declared the application admissible on 14 January 1994. In its report of 27 June 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention (eleven votes to six). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT', '30. At the hearing on 20 June 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to find that there had been no violation of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention.', '31. On the same occasion the applicant reiterated the request to the Court stated in his memorial to find that there had been a breach of Article 7 (art. 7) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 (art. 7) OF THE CONVENTION', '32. The applicant complained that his conviction and sentence for rape of his wife constituted retrospective punishment in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, which reads:', '""1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article (art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.""', '33. The Government and the Commission disagreed with the above contention.', 'A. General principles', '34. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment.', '35. Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37).', '36. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen.', 'B. Application of the foregoing principles', '37. The applicant maintained that the general common law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife, albeit subject to certain limitations, was still effective on 18 September 1990, when he committed the acts which gave rise to the rape charge (see paragraph 8 above). A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 23 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity. It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 18 September 1990 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted.', 'When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 20 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed. On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon. In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created.', 'In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 20 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect.', 'On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 26-27 above). However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal ’ s and the House of Lords ’ rulings in the case of R. v. R. (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). In the applicant ’ s submission, these rulings altered the law retrospectively, which would not have been the case had the Law Commission ’ s proposal been implemented by Parliament. Consequently, he concluded, when Parliament in 1994 removed the word ""unlawful"" from section 1 of the 1976 Act (see paragraph 21 above), it did not merely restate the law as it had been in 1976.', '38. The applicant further argued that in examining his complaint under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention, the Court should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions to the immunity rule. Such exceptions were never contemplated in the national proceedings, Mr Justice Rose having taken his decision in reliance on the Court of Appeal ’ s ruling of 14 March 1991 in R. v. R. to the effect that the immunity no longer existed. Mr Justice Owen ’ s decision of 30 July 1990 in R. v. R., adding implied agreement to terminate consent to intercourse to the list of exceptions, had not been reported by 18 September 1990 and was not a binding authority. In any event, the facts in the present case suggest that no such agreement existed.', '39. Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied. Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law. They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes. To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent. Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred. In September 1990, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary.', '40. The Government and the Commission were of the view that by September 1990 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape. This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable. In particular, given the recognition of women ’ s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant. He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.', '41. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s conviction for rape was based on the statutory offence of rape in section 1 of the 1956 Act, as further defined in section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). The applicant does not dispute that the conduct for which he was convicted would have constituted rape within the meaning of the statutory definition of rape as applicable at the time, had the victim not been his wife. His complaint under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention relates solely to the fact that in deciding on 18 April 1991 that the applicant had a case to answer on the rape charge, Mr Justice Rose followed the Court of Appeal ’ s ruling of 14 March 1991 in the case of R. v. R. which declared that the immunity no longer existed.', '42. It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R. v. R. (summarised at paragraph 11 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"". The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"". The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape. In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37). It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal ’ s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 12 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 11 above).', '43. The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 11 and 23-27 above). There was no doubt under the law as it stood on 18 September 1990 that a husband who forcibly had sexual intercourse with his wife could, in various circumstances, be found guilty of rape. Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape. This evolution had reached a stage where judicial recognition of the absence of immunity had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the law (see paragraph 36 above).', '44. The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 34 above). What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom.', '45. Consequently, by following the Court of Appeal ’ s ruling in R. v. R. in the applicant ’ s case, Mr Justice Rose did not render a decision permitting a finding of guilt incompatible with Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention.', '46. Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to enquire into whether the facts in the applicant ’ s case were covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already made by the English courts before 18 September 1990.', '47. In short, the Court, like the Government and the Commission, finds that the Crown Court ’ s decision that the applicant could not invoke immunity to escape conviction and sentence for rape upon his wife did not give rise to a violation of his rights under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention.']",2,gb,001-57965,0

The applicant married his wife on 11 August 1984. They had one son, who was born in 1985. On 11 November 1987 the couple were separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled.', '9. On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, his wife left the matrimonial home with their son and returned to live with her parents. She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and had left a letter for the applicant in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce. However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to criminal proceedings. The applicant had on 23 October 1989 spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to ""see about a divorce"".', '10. Shortly before 9 p.m. on 12 November 1989, twenty-two days after his wife had returned to live with her parents, and while the parents were out, the applicant forced his way into the parents ’ house and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the wife against her will. In the course of that attempt he assaulted her, in particular by squeezing her neck with both hands.', '11. The applicant was charged with attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. At his trial before the Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted that the charge of rape was one which was not known to the law by reason of the fact that the applicant was the husband of the alleged victim. He relied on a statement by Sir Matthew Hale CJ in his History of the Pleas of the Crown published in 1736:', '""But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.""', '12. In his judgment ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 747) Mr Justice Owen noted that it was a statement made in general terms at a time when marriage was indissoluble. Hale CJ had been expounding the common law as it seemed to him at that particular time and was doing it in a book and not with reference to a particular set of circumstances presented to him in a prosecution. The bald statement had been reproduced in the first edition of Archbold on Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice (1822, p. 259) in the following terms: ""A husband also cannot be guilty of rape upon his wife.""', 'Mr Justice Owen further examined a series of court decisions (R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen ’ s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 113; R. v. Clarke [1949] 2 All England Law Reports 448; R. v. Miller [1954] 2 All England Law Reports 529; R. v. Reid [1972] 2 All England Law Reports 1350; R. v. O ’ Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663; R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22; R. v. Roberts [1986] Criminal Law Reports 188; see paragraphs 19-22 below), recognising that a wife ’ s consent to marital intercourse was impliedly given by her at the time of marriage and that the consent could be revoked on certain conditions. He added:', '""I am asked to accept that there is a presumption or an implied consent by the wife to sexual intercourse with her husband; with that, I do not find it difficult to agree. However, I find it hard to ... believe that it ever was the common law that a husband was in effect entitled to beat his wife into submission to sexual intercourse ... If it was, it is a very sad commentary on the law and a very sad commentary upon the judges in whose breasts the law is said to reside. However, I will nevertheless accept that there is such an implicit consent as to sexual intercourse which requires my consideration as to whether this accused may be convicted for rape.""', 'On the question of what circumstances would suffice in law to revoke the consent, Mr Justice Owen noted that it may be brought to an end, firstly, by a court order or equivalent. Secondly, he observed, it was apparent from the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment in the case of R. v. Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties. Such an agreement could clearly be implicit; there was nothing in the case-law to suggest the contrary. Thirdly, he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated, would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent. He concluded that both the second and third exceptions to the matrimonial immunity against prosecution for rape applied in the case.', 'Following the judge ’ s ruling, the applicant pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years ’ imprisonment.', '13. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, on the ground that Mr Justice Owen had made a wrong decision in law in ruling that a man may rape his wife when the consent to intercourse which his wife gave on entering marriage had been revoked neither by a court order nor by agreement between the parties.', '14. On 14 March 1991 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (Lord Lane CJ, Sir Stephen Brown P, Watkins, Neill and Russell LJJ), unanimously dismissed the appeal ([1991] 2 All England Law Reports 257). Lord Lane noted that the general proposition of Sir Matthew Hale in his History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736) (see paragraph 11 above) that a man could not commit rape upon his wife was generally accepted as a correct statement of the common law at that epoch. Further, Lord Lane made an analysis of previous court decisions, from which it appears that in R. v. Clarence (1888), the first reported case of this nature, some judges of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle. In the next reported case, R. v. Clarke (1949), the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband ’ s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him. Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity (see paragraph 22 below). The Court of Appeal had accepted in R. v. Steele (1976) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Roberts (1986), where it held that the lack of a non-molestation clause in a deed of separation, concluded on expiry of a non-molestation order, did not revive the consent to intercourse.', 'Lord Lane added the following observations:', '""Ever since the decision of Byrne J in R. v. Clarke in 1949, courts have been paying lip-service to Hale CJ ’ s proposition, whilst at the same time increasing the number of exceptions, the number of situations to which it does not apply. This is a legitimate use of the flexibility of the common law which can and should adapt itself to changing social attitudes.', 'There comes a time when the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour.', '...', 'It seems to us that where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in present-day society, the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so in the light of any relevant parliamentary enactment. That in the end comes down to a consideration of the word ‘ unlawful ’ in the 1976 Act.""', 'Lord Lane then critically examined the different strands of interpretation of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" (see paragraph 17 below) excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape. He concluded:', '""... [W]e do not consider that we are inhibited by the 1976 Act from declaring that the husband ’ s immunity as expounded by Hale CJ no longer exists. We take the view that the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim.""', '15. The Court of Appeal granted the applicant leave to appeal to the House of Lords, which unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment on 23 October 1991 ([1991] 4 All England Law Reports 481). Lord Keith of Kinkel, joined by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Griffiths, Lord Ackner and Lord Lowry, gave, inter alia, the following reasons:', '""For over 150 years after the publication of Hale ’ s work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to his proposition. The first such case was R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen ’ s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 133 ... It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England. The common law is, however, capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale ’ s proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects at the time it was enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale ’ s proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.', '...', 'The position then is that that part of Hale ’ s proposition which asserts that a wife cannot retract the consent to sexual intercourse which she gives on marriage has been departed from in a series of decided cases. On grounds of principle there is no good reason why the whole proposition should not be held inapplicable in modern times. The only question is whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presents an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course. The argument is that ‘ unlawful ’ in that subsection means outside the bond of marriage.', '... The fact is that it is clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent, and that the use of the word in the subsection adds nothing. In my opinion there are no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word, and it should be treated as being mere surplusage in this enactment ...', 'I am therefore of the opinion that section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presents no obstacle to this House declaring that in modern times the supposed marital exception in rape forms no part of the law of England. The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, took a similar view [in the present case]. Towards the end of the judgment of that court Lord Lane CJ said ...:', '‘ The remaining and no less difficult question is whether, despite that view, this is an area where the court should step aside to leave the matter to the parliamentary process. This is not the creation of a new offence, it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it. ’', 'I respectfully agree.""']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. The offence of rape', '16. The offence of rape, at common law, was traditionally defined as unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent by force, fear or fraud. By section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, ""it is a felony for a man to rape a woman"".', '17. Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows:', '""For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if -', '(a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...""', '18. On 3 November 1994 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 replaced the above provisions by inserting new subsections to section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, one of the effects of which was to remove the word ""unlawful"":', '""1. (1) It is an offence for a man to rape a woman or another man.', '(2) A man commits rape if – (a) he has sexual intercourse with a person ... who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...""', 'B. Marital immunity', '19. Until the proceedings in the applicant ’ s case the English courts, on the few occasions when they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage. The proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above (see paragraph 11) has been upheld until recently, for example in the case of R. v. Kowalski ([1987] 86 Criminal Appeal Reports 339), which concerned the question whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault. Mr Justice Ian Kennedy, giving the judgment of the court, stated, obiter:', '""It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife.""', 'And he went on to say that that principle was', '""dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement"".', 'In another example, Lord Justice O ’ Connor in the R. v. Roberts case ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188) held:', '""The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.""', '20. However, on 5 November 1990, Mr Justice Simon Brown held in R. v. C. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 755) that the whole concept of marital exemption in rape was misconceived:', '""Were it not for the deeply unsatisfactory consequence of reaching any other conclusion on the point, I would shrink, if sadly, from adopting this radical view of the true position in law. But adopt it I do. Logically, I regard it as the only defensible stance, certainly now as the law has developed and arrived in the late twentieth century. In my judgment, the position in law today is, as already declared in Scotland, that there is no marital exemption to the law of rape. That is the ruling I give.""', 'On the other hand, on 20 November 1990, in R. v. J. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 759) Mr Justice Rougier upheld the general common law rule, considering that the effect of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act was that the marital exemption embodied in Hale ’ s proposition was preserved, subject to those exceptions established by cases decided before the Act was passed. He further stated:', '""... there is an important general principle to be considered here, and that is that the law, especially the criminal law, should be clear so that a man may know where he stands in relation to it. I am not being so fanciful as to suppose that this defendant carefully considered the authorities and took Counsel ’ s advice before behaving as alleged, but the basic principle extends a long way beyond the bounds of this case and should operate to prevent a man being convicted by means of decisions of the law ex post facto.""', 'On 15 January 1991, Mr Justice Swinton Thomas in R. v. S. followed Rougier J, though he considered that it was open to judges to define further exceptions.', 'Both Rougier and Swinton Thomas JJ stated that they regretted that section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act precluded them from taking the same line as Simon Brown J in R. v. C.', '21. In its Working Paper 116 ""Rape within Marriage"" completed on 17 September 1990, the Law Commission stated:', '""2.8 It is generally accepted that, subject to exceptions (considered ... below), a husband cannot be convicted of raping his wife ... Indeed there seems to be no recorded prosecution before 1949 of a husband for raping his wife ...', '...', '2.11 The immunity has given rise to a substantial body of law about the particular cases in which the exemption does not apply. The limits of this law are difficult to state with certainty. Much of it rests on first instance decisions which have never been comprehensively reviewed at appellate level ...""', '22. The Law Commission identified the following exceptions to a husband ’ s immunity:', '- where a court order has been made, in particular:', '(a) where an order of the court has been made which provides that a wife should no longer be bound to cohabit with her husband (R. v. Clarke [1949] 33 Criminal Appeal Reports 216);', '(b) where there has been a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi of divorce on the ground that ""between the pronouncement of decree nisi and the obtaining of a decree absolute a marriage subsists as a mere technicality"" (R. v. O ’ Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663);', '(c) where a court has issued an injunction restraining the husband from molesting the wife or the husband has given an undertaking to the court that he will not molest her (R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22);', '(d) in the case of R. v. Roberts ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188), the Court of Appeal found that where a non-molestation order of two months had been made in favour of the wife her deemed consent to intercourse did not revive on expiry of the order;', '- where no court order has been made:', '(e) Mr Justice Lynskey observed, obiter, in R. v. Miller ([1954] 2 Queen ’ s Bench Division 282) that a wife ’ s consent would be revoked by an agreement to separate, particularly if it contained a non-molestation clause;', '(f) Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane stated, obiter, in R. v. Steele that a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause would have that effect.', '23. The Law Commission noted that it was stated in R. v. Miller and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Steele that lodging a petition for divorce would not be sufficient.', 'It referred also to the ruling by Mr Justice Owen in the present case where an implied agreement to separate was considered sufficient to revoke the immunity and that, even in the absence of agreement, the withdrawal from cohabitation by either party, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, would operate to exclude the immunity. It found this view difficult to reconcile with the approach in Steele that filing a divorce petition was ""clearly"" not sufficient. The ruling in the present case appeared substantially to extend what had previously been thought to be the law, although it emphasised that factual separation, and not mere revocation of consent to intercourse, was necessary to remove the immunity.', '24. The Law Commission pointed out that its inquiry was unusual in one important respect. It was usual practice, when considering the reform of common law rules, to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law, in order to analyse whether those grounds were well-founded. However, that step was of little assistance here, partly because there was little case-law on the subject but principally because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported (paragraph 4.1 of the Working Paper). The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife ’ s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir Matthew Hale in his dictum. This notion was not only quite artificial but, certainly in the modern context, was also quite anomalous. Indeed, it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable. The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage (paragraph 4.2).', 'The concept of deemed consent was artificial because the legal consequences of marriage were not the result of the parties ’ mutual agreement. Although the parties should have legal capacity to enter into the marriage contract and should observe the necessary formalities, they were not free to decide the terms of the contract; marriage was rather a status from which flow certain rights or obligations, the contents of which were determined by the law from time to time. This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice Hawkins in R. v. Clarence (1888) when he said: ""The intercourse which takes place between husband and wife after marriage is not by virtue of any special consent on her part, but is mere submission to an obligation imposed on her by law"" (paragraph 4.3).', 'In this connection, the Law Commission stressed that ""[t]he rights and duties arising from marriage have, however, changed over the years as the law has adapted to changing social conditions and values. The more modern view of marriage is that it is a partnership of equals"" (paragraph 4.4). It then gave examples of such changes in the law and added:', '""4.11 This gradual recognition of mutual rights and obligations within marriage, described in paragraphs 4.3-4.10 above, in our view demonstrates clearly that, whatever other arguments there may be in favour of the immunity, it cannot be claimed to be in any way justified by the nature of, or by the law governing, modern marriage.""', '25. The Law Commission made, inter alia, the provisional proposal that ""the present marital immunity be abolished in all cases"" (paragraph 5.2 of the Working Paper).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '26. In his application of 31 March 1992 (no. 20190/92) to the Commission, the applicant complained that, in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, he was convicted in respect of conduct, namely the attempted rape upon his wife, which at the relevant time did not, so he submitted, constitute a criminal offence.', '27. The Commission declared the application admissible on 14 January 1994. In its report of 27 June 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention (fourteen votes to three). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT', '28. At the hearing on 20 June 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violation of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention.', '29. On the same occasion the applicant reiterated the request to the Court stated in his memorial to find that there had been a breach of Article 7 (art. 7) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 (art. 7) OF THE CONVENTION', '30. The applicant complained that his conviction and sentence for attempted rape of his wife constituted retrospective punishment in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, which reads:', '""1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article (art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.""', '31. The Government and the Commission disagreed with the above contention.', 'A. General principles', '32. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment.', '33. Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37).', '34. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen.', 'B. Application of the foregoing principles', '35. The applicant maintained that the general common law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife, albeit subject to certain limitations, was still effective on 12 November 1989, when he committed the acts which gave rise to the charge of attempted rape paragraph 10 above). A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity. It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted. The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 19 91 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law.', 'When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed. On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon. In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created.', 'In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect.', 'On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal ’ s and the House of Lords ’ rulings in the applicant ’ s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). In the applicant ’ s submission, these rulings altered the law retrospectively, which would not have been the case had the Law Commission ’ s proposal been implemented by Parliament. Consequently, he concluded, when Parliament in 1994 removed the word ""unlawful"" from section 1 of the 1976 Act (see paragraph 18 above), it did not merely restate the law as it had been in 1976.', '36. The applicant further argued that in examining his complaint under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention, the Court should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions to the immunity rule. The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant ’ s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.', '37. Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied. Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law. They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes. To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent. Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred. In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary.', '38. The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape. This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable. In particular, given the recognition of women ’ s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant. He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.', 'In addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse. The circumstances in his case were thus covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already stated by the English courts.', '39. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s conviction for attempted rape was based on the statutory offence of rape in section 1 of the 1956 Act, as further defined in section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). The applicant does not dispute that the conduct for which he was convicted would have constituted attempted rape within the meaning of the statutory definition of rape as applicable at the time, had the victim not been his wife. His complaint under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention relates solely to the fact that he could not avail himself of the marital immunity under common law because, so he submitted, it had been retrospectively abolished.', '40. It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"". The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"". The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape. In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37). It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal ’ s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above).', '41. The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 14 and 20-25 above). There was no doubt under the law as it stood on 12 November 1989 that a husband who forcibly had sexual intercourse with his wife could, in various circumstances, be found guilty of rape. Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape. This evolution had reached a stage where judicial recognition of the absence of immunity had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the law (see paragraph 34 above).', '42. The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above). What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom.', '43. Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to enquire into whether the facts in the applicant ’ s case were covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already made by the English courts before 12 November 1989.', '44. In short, the Court, like the Government and the Commission, finds that the national courts ’ decisions that the applicant could not invoke immunity to escape conviction and sentence for attempted rape upon his wife did not give rise to a violation of his rights under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention.']",2,gb,001-57955,0

Mr William Goodwin, a British national, is a journalist and lives in London.', '11. On 3 August 1989 the applicant joined the staff of The Engineer, published by Morgan-Grampian (Publishers) Ltd (""the publishers""), as a trainee journalist. He was employed by Morgan Grampian PLC (""the employer"").', 'On 2 November 1989 the applicant was telephoned by a person who, according to the applicant, had previously supplied him with information on the activities of various companies. The source gave him information about Tetra Ltd (""Tetra""), to the effect that the company was in the process of raising a £5 million loan and had financial problems as a result of an expected loss of £2.1 million for 1989 on a turnover of £20.3 million. The information was unsolicited and was not given in exchange for any payment. It was provided on an unattributable basis. The applicant maintained that he had no reason to believe that the information derived from a stolen or confidential document. On 6 and 7 November 1989, intending to write an article about Tetra, he telephoned the company to check the facts and seek its comments on the information.', 'The information derived from a draft of Tetra ’ s confidential corporate plan. On 1 November 1989 there had been eight numbered copies of the most recent draft. Five had been in the possession of senior employees of Tetra, one with its accountants, one with a bank and one with an outside consultant. Each had been in a ring binder and was marked ""Strictly Confidential"". The accountants ’ file had last been seen at about 3 p.m. on 1 November in a room they had been using at Tetra ’ s premises. The room had been left unattended between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and during that period the file had disappeared.', 'A. Injunction and orders for disclosure of sources and documents', '12. On 7 November 1989 Mr Justice Hoffmann of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) granted an application by Tetra of the same date for an ex parte interim injunction restraining the publishers of The Engineer from publishing any information derived from the corporate plan. The company informed all the national newspapers and relevant journals of the injunction on 16 November.', '13. In an affidavit to the High Court dated 8 November 1989, Tetra stated that if the plan were to be made public it could result in a complete loss of confidence in the company on the part of its actual and potential creditors, its customers and in particular its suppliers, with a risk of loss of orders and of a refusal to supply the company with goods and services. This would inevitably lead to problems with Tetra ’ s refinancing negotiations. If the company went into liquidation, there would be approximately four hundred redundancies.', '14. On 14 November 1989 Mr Justice Hoffmann, on an application by Tetra, ordered the publishers, under section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (""the 1981 Act""; see paragraph 20 below), to disclose by 3 p.m. on 15 November the applicant ’ s notes from the above telephone conversation identifying his source. On the latter date, the publishers having failed to comply with the order, Mr Justice Hoffmann granted Tetra leave to join the applicant ’ s employer and the applicant himself to the proceedings and gave the defendants until 3 p.m. on the following day to produce the notes.', 'On 17 November 1989 the High Court made a further order to the effect that the applicant represented all persons who had received the plan or information derived from it without authority and that such persons should deliver up any copies of the plan in their possession. The motion was then adjourned for the applicant to bring this order to the attention of his source. However, the applicant declined to do so.', '15. On 22 November 1989 Mr Justice Hoffmann ordered the applicant to disclose by 3 p.m. on 23 November his notes on the grounds that it was necessary ""in the interests of justice"", within the meaning of section 10 of the 1981 Act (see paragraph 20 below), for the source ’ s identity to be disclosed in order to enable Tetra to bring proceedings against the source to recover the document, obtain an injunction preventing further publication or seek damages for the expenses to which it had been put. The judge concluded:', '""There is strong prima facie evidence that it has suffered aserious wrong by the theft of its confidential file. Thereis similar evidence that it would suffer serious commercialdamage from the publication of the information in the fileduring the near future. It is true that the source may notbe the person who stole the file. He may have had theinformation second hand, although this is less likely. Ineither case, however, he was trying to secure damagingpublication of information which he must have known to besensitive and confidential. According to the respondent,having given him the information he telephoned again a fewdays later to ask how the article was getting on. The plaintiff wishes to bring proceedings against the source forrecovery of the document, an injunction against furtherpublication and damages for the expense to which it has beenput. But it cannot obtain any of those remedies because itdoes not know whom to sue. In the circumstance of this case,in which a remedy against the source is urgently needed, Ithink that disclosure is necessary in the interests ofjustice.', '... There is no doubt on the evidence that the respondent wasan innocent recipient of the information but the NorwichPharmacal case shows that this does not matter. The questionis whether he had become mixed up in the wrongdoing ...', 'The respondent has sworn an affidavit expressing the viewthat the public interest requires publication of theplaintiff ’ s confidential commercial information. Counsel forthe respondent says that the plaintiff ’ s previous publishedresults showed it as a prosperous expanding company andtherefore the public was entitled to know that it was nowexperiencing difficulties. I reject this submission. Thereis nothing to suggest that the information in the draftbusiness plan falsifies anything which has been previouslymade public or that the plaintiff was under any obligation,whether in law or commercial morality, to make thatinformation available to its customers, suppliers andcompetitors. On the contrary, it seems to me that businesscould not function properly if such information could not be kept confidential.""', '16. On the same date the Court of Appeal rejected an application by the applicant for a stay of execution of the High Court ’ s order, but substituted an order requiring the applicant either to disclose his notes to Tetra or to deliver them to the Court of Appeal in a sealed envelope with accompanying affidavit. The applicant did not comply with this order.', 'B. Appeals to the Court of Appeal and to the House of Lords', '17. On 23 November 1989 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal from Mr Justice Hoffmann ’ s order of 22 November 1989. He argued that disclosure of his notes was not ""necessary in the interests of justice"" within the meaning of section 10 of the 1981 Act; the public interest in publication outweighed the interest in preserving confidentiality; and, since he had not facilitated any breach of confidence, the disclosure order against him was invalid.', 'The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 12 December 1989. Lord Donaldson held:', '""The existence of someone with access to highly confidentialinformation belonging to the plaintiffs who was prepared tobreak his obligations of confidentiality in this way was apermanent threat to the plaintiffs which could only beeliminated by discovering his identity. The injunctionswould no doubt be effective to prevent publication in thepress, but they certainly would not effectively preventpublication to the plaintiffs ’ customers or competitors.', '...', '... I am loath in a judgment given in open court to give adetailed explanation of why this is a case in which, if thefull facts were known and the courts had to say that theycould give the plaintiffs no assistance, there would, Ithink, be a significant lessening in public confidence in theadministration of justice generally. Suffice it to say thatthe plaintiffs are a, and perhaps the, leader in their veryimportant field, which I deliberately do not identify, withnational and international customers and competitors. They are faced with a situation which is in part the result oftheir own success. They have reached a point at which theyhave to refinance and expand or go under with the loss notonly of money, but of a significant number of jobs. This isnot the situation in which the court should be or be seen tobe impotent in the absence of compelling reasons. The plaintiffs are continuing with their refinancing discussionsmenaced by the source (or the source ’ s source) ticking awaybeneath them like a time bomb. Prima facie they are entitledto assistance in identifying, locating and defusing it.', 'That I should have concluded that the disclosure of Mr Goodwin ’ s source is necessary in the interests of justiceis not determinative of this appeal. It does, however, meanthat I have to undertake a balancing exercise. On the onehand there is the general public interest in maintaining theconfidentiality of journalistic sources, which is the reasonwhy section 10 was enacted. On the other is, in my judgment,a particular case in which disclosure is necessary in thegeneral interests of the administration of justice. If thesetwo factors stood alone, the case for ordering disclosurewould be made out, because the parliamentary intention mustbe that, other things being equal, the necessity fordisclosure on any of the four grounds should prevail. Were it otherwise, there would be no point in having these doorways.', 'But other things would not be equal if, on the particular facts of the case, there was some additional reason formaintaining the confidentiality of a journalistic source. It might, for example, have been the case that the information disclosed what, on the authorities, is quaintly called `iniquity ’. Or the plaintiffs might have been a publiccompany whose shareholders were unjustifiably being kept inignorance of information vital to their making a sensibledecision on whether or not to sell their shares. Such afeature would erode the public interest in maintaining theconfidentiality of the leaked information and correspondingly enhance the public interest in maintaining theconfidentiality of journalistic sources. Equally, onparticular facts such as that the identification of thesource was necessary in order to support or refute a defenceof alibi in a major criminal trial, the necessity fordisclosure `in the interests of justice ’ might be enhancedand overreach the threshold of the statutory doorway requiring some vastly increased need for the protection ofthe source if it was to be counterbalanced. Once the[plaintiffs] can get through a doorway, the balancing exercise comes into play.', 'On the facts of this case, nothing is to be added to eitherside of the equation. The test of the needs of justice ismet, but not in superabundance. The general public interestin maintaining the confidentiality of journalistic sourcesexists, but the facts of this particular case add absolutelynothing to it. No `iniquity ’ has been shown. No shareholders have been kept in the dark. Indeed the publichas no legitimate interest in the business of the plaintiffswho, although corporate in form, are in truth to becategorised as private individuals. This is in reality apiece of wholly unjustified intrusion into privacy.', 'Accordingly, I am left in no doubt that, notwithstanding thegeneral need to protect journalistic sources, this is a casein which the balance comes down in favour of disclosure. Iwould dismiss the companies ’ appeals. I can see no reason injustice for doing otherwise with regard to Mr Goodwin ’ sappeals .""', 'Lord Justice McCowan stated that the applicant must have been ""amazingly naïve"" if it had not occurred to him that the source had been at the very least guilty of breach of confidence.', 'The Court of Appeal granted the applicant leave to appeal to the House of Lords.', '18. The House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal ’ s decision on 4 April 1990, applying the principle expounded by Lord Reid in Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] Appeal Cases 133, a previous leading case:', '""if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in thetortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrongdoinghe may incur no personal liability but he comes under a dutyto assist the person who has been wronged by giving him fullinformation and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers.""', 'Lord Bridge, in the first of the five separate speeches given in the applicant ’ s case, underlined that in applying section 10 it was necessary to carry out a balancing exercise between the need to protect sources and, inter alia, the ""interests of justice"". He referred to a number of other cases in relation to how the balancing exercise should be conducted (in particular Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd [1985] Appeal Cases 339) and continued:', '""... the question whether disclosure is necessary in theinterests of justice gives rise to a more difficult problemof weighing one public interest against another. A questionarising under this part of section 10 has not previously comebefore your Lordships ’ House for decision. In discussing thesection generally Lord Diplock said in Secretary of State forDefence v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd [1985] Appeal Cases 339,350:', '`The exceptions include no reference to ""the public interest""generally and I would add that in my view the expression""justice "", the interests of which are entitled to protection,is not used in a general sense as the antonym of"" injustice""but in the technical sense of the administration of justicein the course of legal proceedings in a court of law, or, byreason of the extended definition of ""court"" in section 19 ofthe Act of 1981 before a tribunal or body exercising thejudicial power of the state. ’', 'I agree entirely with the first half of this dictum. To construe `justice ’ as the antonym of `injustice ’ insection 10 would be far too wide. But to confine it to the`technical sense of the administration of justice in thecourse of legal proceedings in a court of law ’ seems to me,with all respect due to any dictum of the late Lord Diplock,to be too narrow. It is, in my opinion, `in the interests of justice ’, in the sense in which this phrase is used insection 10, that persons should be enabled to exerciseimportant legal rights and to protect themselves from seriouslegal wrongs whether or not resort to legal proceedings in acourt of law will be necessary to attain these objectives.Thus, to take a very obvious example, if an employer of alarge staff is suffering grave damage from the activities ofan unidentified disloyal servant, it is undoubtedly in theinterests of justice that he should be able to identify himin order to terminate his contract of employment,notwithstanding that no legal proceedings may be necessary to achieve that end.', 'Construing the phrase `in the interests of justice ’ in thissense immediately emphasises the importance of the balancingexercise. It will not be sufficient, per se, for a partyseeking disclosure of a source protected by section 10 toshow merely that he will be unable without disclosure toexercise the legal right or avert the threatened legal wrongon which he bases his claim in order to establish thenecessity of disclosure. The judge ’ s task will always be toweigh in the scales the importance of enabling the ends ofjustice to be attained in the circumstances of the particularcase on the one hand against the importance of protecting thesource on the other hand. In this balancing exercise it isonly if the judge is satisfied that disclosure in theinterests of justice is of such preponderating importance asto override the statutory privilege against disclosure thatthe threshold of necessity will be reached.', 'Whether the necessity of disclosure in this sense is established is certainly a question of fact rather than anissue calling for the exercise of the judge ’ s discretion,but, like many other questions of fact, such as the questionof whether somebody has acted reasonably in givencircumstances, it will call for the exercise of adiscriminating and sometimes difficult value judgment. Inestimating the weight to be attached to the importance ofdisclosure in pursuance of the policy which underliessection 10 on the other hand, many factors will be relevanton both sides of the scale.', 'It would be foolish to attempt to give a comprehensive guidance as to how the balancing exercise should be carriedout. But it may not be out of place to indicate the kind offactors which will require consideration. In estimating theimportance to be given to the case in favour of disclosurethere will be a wide spectrum within which the particularcase must be located. If the party seeking disclosure shows,for example, that his very livelihood depends upon it, thiswill put the case near one end of the spectrum. If he showsno more than that what he seeks to protect is a minorinterest in property, this will put the case at or near theother end. On the other side the importance of protecting asource from disclosure in pursuance of the policy underlyingthe statute will also vary within a spectrum. One importantfactor will be the nature of the information obtained fromthe source. The greater the legitimate interest in theinformation which the source has given to the publisher orintended publisher, the greater will be the importance ofprotecting the source. But another and perhaps moresignificant factor which will very much affect the importanceof protecting the source will be the manner in which theinformation was itself obtained by the source. If it appearsto the court that the information was obtained legitimatelythis will enhance the importance of protecting the source.Conversely, if it appears that the information was obtainedillegally, this will diminish the importance of protectingthe source unless, of course, this factor is counterbalancedby a clear public interest in publication of the information,as in the classic case where the source has acted for thepurpose of exposing iniquity. I draw attention to theseconsiderations by way of illustration only and I emphasiseonce again that they are in no way intended to be read as acode ...', 'In the circumstances of the instant case, I have no doubtthat [the High Court] and the Court of Appeal were right infinding that the necessity for disclosure of Mr Goodwin ’ snotes in the interests of justice was established. Theimportance to the plaintiffs of obtaining disclosure lies inthe threat of severe damage to their business, andconsequentially to the livelihood of their employees, whichwould arise from disclosure of the information contained intheir corporate plan while their refinancing negotiations arestill continuing. This threat ... can only be defused ifthey can identify the source either as himself the thief ofthe stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to theidentification of the thief and thus put themselves in aposition to institute proceedings for the recovery of themissing document. The importance of protecting the source onthe other hand is much diminished by the source ’ s complicity,at the very least, in a gross breach of confidentiality whichis not counterbalanced by any legitimate interest whichpublication of the information was calculated to serve.Disclosure in the interests of justice is, on this view ofthe balance, clearly of preponderating importance so as tooverride the policy underlying the statutory protection ofsources and the test of necessity for disclosure is satisfied...""', 'Lord Templeman added that the applicant should have ""recognised that [the information] was both confidential and damaging"".', 'C. Fine for contempt of court', '19. In the meantime, on 23 November 1989, the applicant had been served with a motion seeking his committal for contempt of court, an offence which was punishable by an unlimited fine or up to two years ’ imprisonment (section 14 of the 1981 Act). On 24 November, at a hearing in the High Court, counsel for the applicant had conceded that he had been in contempt but the motion was adjourned pending the appeal.', 'Following the House of Lord ’ s dismissal of the appeal, the High Court, on 10 April 1990, fined the applicant £5,000 for contempt of court.']","['II.

Section 14 [3] reads:', '""In any case where a court has power to commit a person toprison for contempt of court and (apart from this provision)no limitation applies to the period of committal, thecommittal shall (without prejudice to the power of the courtto order his earlier discharge) be for a fixed term, and thatterm shall not on any occasion exceed two years in the caseof committal by a superior court, or one month in the case ofcommittal by an inferior court.""', '22. In Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers Lord Diplock considered the expression ""interests of justice"" in section 10 of the 1981 Act:', '""The exceptions include no reference to the ‘ public interest ’ generally and I would add that in my view the expression ’ justice ’, the interests of which are entitled to protection,is not used in a general sense as the antonym of ‘ injustice ’ but in a technical sense of the administration of justice inthe course of legal proceedings in a court of law ...

Granada Television ...consist of or include documents that have been supplied tothe media in breach of confidence.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '23. In his application (no. 17488/90) of 27 September 1990 to the Commission, the applicant complained that the imposition of a disclosure order requiring him to reveal the identity of a source violated his right to freedom of expression under Article 1 0 (art. 10) of the Convention.', '24. The Commission declared the application admissible on 7 September 1993.

The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with itduties and responsibilities, may be subject to suchformalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as areprescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society,in the interests of national security, territorial integrityor public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime,for the protection of health or morals, for the protection ofthe reputation or rights of others, for preventing thedisclosure of information received in confidence, or formaintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '28. It was undisputed that the measures constituted an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1) and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. It must therefore examine whether the interference was justified under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', 'A. Was the interference ""prescribed by law""?', '29. The Court observes that, and this was not disputed, the impugned disclosure order and the fine had a basis in national law, namely sections 10 and 14 of the 1981 Act (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). On the other hand, the applicant maintained that as far as the disclosure order was concerned the relevant national law failed to satisfy the foreseeability requirement which flows from the expression ""prescribed by law"".', '30. The Government contested this allegation whereas the Commission did not find it necessary to reach a conclusion on this point.', '31. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned - if need be with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37).', '32. The applicant argued that the interests-of-justice exception to the protection of sources under section 10 of the 1981 Act was not sufficiently precise to enable journalists to foresee the circumstances in which such an order could be made against them in order to protect a private company. By applying this provision to the present case, Lord Bridge had completely revised the interpretation given by Lord Diplock in Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers. The balancing exercise introduced by Lord Bridge amounted to subjective judicial assessment of factors based on retrospective evidence presented by the party seeking to discover the identity of the source (see paragraph 18 above). At the time the source provided the information, the journalist could not possibly know whether the party ’ s livelihood depended upon such discovery and could not assess with any degree of certainty the public interest in the information. A journalist would usually be in a position to judge whether the information was acquired by legitimate means or not, but would not be able to predict how the courts would view the matter. The law, as it stood, was no more than a mandate to the judiciary to order journalists to disclose sources if they were ""moved"" by the complaint of an aggrieved party.', '33. The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may even be desirable to enable the national courts to develop the law in the light of their assessment of what measures are necessary in the interests of justice.', 'Contrary to what is suggested by the applicant, the relevant law did not confer an unlimited discretion on the English courts in determining whether an order for disclosure should be made in the interests of justice. Important limitations followed in the first place from the terms of section 10 of the 1981 Act, according to which an order for disclosure could be made if it was ""established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure [was] necessary in the interests of justice"" (see paragraph 20 above).', 'In addition, at the material time, that is when the applicant received the information from his source, there existed not only an interpretation by Lord Diplock of the interests-of-justice provision in section 10 in the case of Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers but also a ruling by Lord Reid in Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners (1973), to the effect that a person who through no fault of his own gets mixed up in wrongdoing may come under a duty to disclose the identity of the wrongdoer (see paragraphs 15, 18 and 22 above).', 'In the Court ’ s view the interpretation of the relevant law made by the House of Lords in the applicant ’ s case did not go beyond what could be reasonably foreseen in the circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, the recent S.W. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-B, p. 42, para. 36). Nor does it find any other indication that the law in question did not afford the applicant adequate protection against arbitrary interference.', '34. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the impugned measures were ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Did the interference pursue a legitimate aim?', '35. It was not disputed before the Convention institutions that the aim of the impugned measures was to protect Tetra ’ s rights and that the interference thus pursued a legitimate aim. The Government maintained that the measures were also taken for the prevention of crime.', '36. The Court, being satisfied that the interference pursued the first of these aims, does not find it necessary to determine whether it also pursued the second.', 'C. Was the interference ""necessary in a democratic society""?', '37. The applicant and the Commission were of the opinion that Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention required that any compulsion imposed on a journalist to reveal his source had to be limited to exceptional circumstances where vital public or individual interests were at stake. This test was not satisfied in the present case.', 'The applicant and the Commission invoked the fact that Tetra had already obtained an injunction restraining publication (see paragraph 12 above), and that no breach of that injunction had occurred. Since the information in question was of a type commonly found in the business press, they did not consider that the risk of damage that further publication could cause was substantiated by Tetra, which had suffered none of the harm adverted to. The applicant added that the information was newsworthy even though it did not reveal matters of vital public interest, such as crime or malfeasance. The information about Tetra ’ s mismanagement, losses and loan-seeking activities was factual, topical and of direct interest to customers and investors in the market for computer software. In any event, the degree of public interest in the information could not be a test of whether there was a pressing social need to order the source ’ s disclosure. A source may provide information of little value one day and of great value the next; what mattered was that the relationship between the journalist and the source was generating the kind of information which had legitimate news potential. This was not to deny Tetra ’ s entitlement to keep its operations secret, if it could, but to contest that there was a pressing social need for punishing the applicant for refusing to disclose the source of the information which Tetra had been unable to keep secret.', '38. The Government contended that the disclosure order was necessary in a democratic society for the protection of ""the rights"" of Tetra. The function of the domestic courts was both to ascertain facts and, in the light of the facts established, to determine the legal consequences which should flow from them. In the Government ’ s view, the supervisory jurisdiction of the Convention institutions extended only to the latter. These limitations on the Convention review were of importance in the present case, where the national courts had proceeded on the basis that the applicant had received the information from his source in ignorance as to its confidential nature, although, in fact, this was something he ought to have recognised. Moreover, the source was probably the thief of the confidential business plan and had improper motives for divulging the information. In addition, the plaintiffs would suffer serious commercial damage from further publication of the information. These findings by the domestic courts were based upon the evidence which was placed before them.', 'It was further submitted that there was no significant public interest in the publication of the confidential information received by the applicant. Although there is a general public interest in the free flow of information to journalists, both sources and journalists must recognise that a journalist ’ s express promise of confidentiality or his implicit undertaking of non- attributability may have to yield to a greater public interest. The journalist ’ s privilege should not extend to the protection of a source who has conducted himself mala fide or, at least, irresponsibly, in order to enable him to pass on, with impunity, information which has no public importance. The source in the present case had not exercised the responsibility which was called for by Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention. The information in issue did not possess a public-interest content which justified interference with the rights of a private company such as Tetra.', 'Although it was true that effective injunctions had been obtained, so long as the thief and the source remained untraced, the plaintiffs were at risk of further dissemination of the information and, consequently, of damage to their business and to the livelihood of their employees. There were no other means by which Tetra ’ s business confidence could have been protected.', 'In these circumstances, according to the Government, the order requiring the applicant to divulge his source and the further order fining him for his refusal to do so did not amount to a breach of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 1 0 (art. 10) of the Convention.', '39. The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (see, as a recent authority, the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, para. 31).', 'Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom, as is reflected in the laws and the professional codes of conduct in a number of Contracting States and is affirmed in several international instruments on journalistic freedoms (see, amongst others, the Resolution on Journalistic Freedoms and Human Rights, adopted at the 4th European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy (Prague, 7-8 December 1994) and Resolution on the Confidentiality of Journalists ’ Sources by the European Parliament, 18 January 1994, Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 44/34). Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected. Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom, such a measure cannot be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest.', 'These considerations are to be taken into account in applying to the facts of the present case the test of necessity in a democratic society under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).', '40. As a matter of general principle, the ""necessity"" for any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, pp. 28-29, para. 50, for a statement of the major principles governing the ""necessity"" test). Admittedly, it is in the first place for the national authorities to assess whether there is a ""pressing social need"" for the restriction and, in making their assessment, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. In the present context, however, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press. Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In sum, limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources call for the most careful scrutiny by the Court.', 'The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory function, is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 (art. 10) the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, the Court must look at the ""interference"" complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ""relevant and sufficient"".', '41. In the instant case, as appears from Lord Bridge ’ s speech in the House of Lords, Tetra was granted an order for source disclosure primarily on the grounds of the threat of severe damage to their business, and consequently to the livelihood of their employees, which would arise from disclosure of the information in their corporate plan while their refinancing negotiations were still continuing (see paragraph 18 above). This threat, ""ticking away beneath them like a time bomb"", as Lord Donaldson put it in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 17 above), could only be defused, Lord Bridge considered, if they could identify the source either as himself the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to identification of the thief and thus put the company in a position to institute proceedings for the recovery of the missing document. The importance of protecting the source, Lord Bridge concluded, was much diminished by the source ’ s complicity, at the very least, in a gross breach of confidentiality which was not counterbalanced by any legitimate interest in publication of the information (see paragraph 18 above).', '42. In the Court ’ s view, the justifications for the impugned disclosure order in the present case have to be seen in the broader context of the ex parte interim injunction which had earlier been granted to the company, restraining not only the applicant himself but also the publishers of The Engineer from publishing any information derived from the plan. That injunction had been notified to all the national newspapers and relevant journals (see paragraph 12 above). The purpose of the disclosure order was to a very large extent the same as that already being achieved by the injunction, namely to prevent dissemination of the confidential information contained in the plan. There was no doubt, according to Lord Donaldson in the Court of Appeal, that the injunction was effective in stopping dissemination of the confidential information by the press (see paragraph 17 above). Tetra ’ s creditors, customers, suppliers and competitors would not therefore come to learn of the information through the press. A vital component of the threat of damage to the company had thus already largely been neutralised by the injunction. This being so, in the Court ’ s opinion, in so far as the disclosure order merely served to reinforce the injunction, the additional restriction on freedom of expression which it entailed was not supported by sufficient reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) of the Convention.', '43. What remains to be ascertained by the Court is whether the further purposes served by the disclosure order provided sufficient justification.', '44. In this respect it is true, as Lord Donaldson put it, that the injunction ""would not effectively prevent publication to [Tetra ’ s] customers or competitors"" directly by the applicant journalist ’ s source (or that source ’ s source) (see paragraph 17 above). Unless aware of the identity of the source, Tetra would not be in a position to stop such further dissemination of the contents of the plan, notably by bringing proceedings against him or her for recovery of the missing document, for an injunction against further disclosure by him or her and for compensation for damage.', 'It also had a legitimate reason as a commercial enterprise in unmasking a disloyal employee or collaborator, who might have continuing access to its premises, in order to terminate his or her association with the company.', '45. These are undoubtedly relevant reasons. However, as also recognised by the national courts, it will not be sufficient, per se, for a party seeking disclosure of a source to show merely that he or she will be unable without disclosure to exercise the legal right or avert the threatened legal wrong on which he or she bases his or her claim in order to establish the necessity of disclosure (see paragraph 18 above). In that connection, the Court would recall that the considerations to be taken into account by the Convention institutions for their review under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) tip the balance of competing interests in favour of the interest of democratic society in securing a free press (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot find that Tetra ’ s interests in eliminating, by proceedings against the source, the residual threat of damage through dissemination of the confidential information otherwise than by the press, in obtaining compensation and in unmasking a disloyal employee or collaborator were, even if considered cumulatively, sufficient to outweigh the vital public interest in the protection of the applicant journalist ’ s source. The Court does not therefore consider that the further purposes served by the disclosure order, when measured against the standards imposed by the Convention, amount to an overriding requirement in the public interest.', '46. In sum, there was not, in the Court ’ s view, a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the disclosure order and the means deployed to achieve that aim. The restriction which the disclosure order entailed on the applicant journalist ’ s exercise of his freedom of expression cannot therefore be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society, within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), for the protection of Tetra ’ s rights under English law, notwithstanding the margin of appreciation available to the national authorities.', 'Accordingly, the Court concludes that both the order requiring the applicant to reveal his source and the fine imposed upon him for having refused to do so gave rise to a violation of his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (art. 10).', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION', '47. Mr William Goodwin sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, which reads :', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by alegal authority or any other authority of a High ContractingParty is completely or partially in conflict with theobligations arising from the ... Convention, and if theinternal law of the said Party allows only partial reparationto be made for the consequences of this decision or measure,the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford justsatisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '48. The applicant claimed 15,000 pounds sterling for non-pecuniary damage, on account of mental anguish, shock, dismay and anxiety which he felt as a result of the proceedings against him. For five months he was in constant peril of being sent to prison, for up to two years, as a punishment for obeying his conscience and for living up to his ethical obligations as a journalist. He still has to live with a criminal record since his crime of contempt of court would not be expunged by a finding of breach by the Court. He had been the subject of harassment by court process servers and his employers so as to comply with a court order against themselves, all of which was added to the pressure exerted on him by the threat of dismissal if he did not disclose the identity of his source.', '49. The Government objected to the applicant ’ s claim on the ground that the alleged adverse consequences stemmed from the fact that he was defying and disobeying the law. Even if he considered it a bad law, he should have obeyed the order to provide the information to the court in a sealed envelope, or, at the very least, he should have recognised his duty to obey the disclosure order when he lost his case in the House of Lords. Had he done so, the Government would have found it difficult to resist a claim for compensation for any adverse consequences.', '50. The Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s arguments. What matters under Article 50 (art. 50) is whether the facts found to constitute a violation have resulted in non-pecuniary damage. In the present case, the Court finds it established that there was a causal link between the anxiety and distress suffered by the applicant and the breach found of the Convention. However, in the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that this finding constitutes adequate just satisfaction in respect of the damage claimed under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '51. The applicant further sought reimbursement of costs and expenses totalling £49,500, in respect of the following items specified in his memorial to the Court of 1 March 1995:', '(a) £19,500 for counsel ’ s fees for drafting the application to the Commission and written observations to the latter and the Court and for preparing and presenting the case before both the Commission and the Court;', '(b) £30,000 for work by the applicant ’ s solicitors in connection with the proceedings before the Commission and the Court.', 'To the above amounts should be added any applicable value added tax (VAT).', '52. The Government, by letter of 11 April 1995, invited the applicant to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs.', '53. In a letter of 25 July 1995 the applicant stated that the solicitors ’ work before the Commission and Court amounted to a total of 136 hours at, on average, £250 per hour for a senior partner and £150 per hour for an assistant solicitor.', '54. On 30 August 1995, the Government submitted their comments on the breakdown provided by the applicant. Without prejudice to the Court ’ s decision regarding the belatedness of the applicant ’ s claim, they stated that they considered that the £19,500 sought in respect of counsel was unreasonably high and that £16,000 would be reasonable.', 'As to solicitors ’ fees, the Government regarded the rates and the number of hours claimed as excessive. In their view 110 hours at an average rate of £160 per hour for a senior partner and £100 per hour for an assistant solicitor would be reasonable.', 'According to the Government ’ s calculations, it would be reasonable to indemnify the applicant £37,59 5.50 (VAT included) for costs.', '55. By letter of 1 September 1995, the applicant stressed that the number of hours and the hourly rates claimed were reasonable. He conceded that if the Court found in his favour, it could properly in its discretion award the amounts indicated by the Government. He stated that he would be prepared to settle for a total figure midway between the total figures contended for by the two parties.', '56. The Court considers the sum conceded by the Government to be adequate in the circumstances of the present case. The Court therefore awards the applicant £37,595,50 (VAT included) for legal costs and expenses, less the 9,300 French francs already paid in legal aid by the Council of Europe in respect of legal fees.', 'C. Default interest', '57. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.']",1,gb,001-57974,1

PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE', 'A. The background', '7. The applicant is a British citizen and a Gypsy. She lives with her three children in caravans parked on land owned by her off Meadow Drove, Willingham, South Cambridgeshire, England. She is married but separated from her husband in 1991.', ""8. As far back as can be traced, the applicant's family have been Gypsies based in South Cambridgeshire. She has lived in caravans all her life and as a child travelled with her parents in this area. She continued this itinerant life until shortly before the birth of her third child in 1988."", ""9. In 1988 the applicant's sister and brother-in-law acquired a one-acre (approximately 4000 square metres) site off Meadow Drove, Willingham, and were granted personal, temporary planning permission for one living unit, comprising two caravans."", ""10. At her sister's invitation she moved on to this site in November 1988 when she was expecting her third child, because she had found it hard being constantly on the move with young children. During this period of settled living the two eldest children were able to attend a local school, where they integrated well."", ""11. On an unspecified date in 1988, the applicant acquired part of her sister's land (0.16 hectare) to the rear of the site, furthest away from Meadow Drove. She moved her three caravans on to this plot."", ""12. Her land is now part of a group of six adjacent sites which are occupied by Gypsies. One plot has received permanent planning permission for the residential use of three caravans. The site occupied by the applicant's sister enjoyed temporary permission until 4 August 1995. The remaining three sites have been occupied without planning permission and the occupants have been subject to enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 32 below). The occupants of two of those sites have also introduced applications before the European Commission of Human Rights."", '13. The applicant has stated that she intends to resume her travelling life sometime in the future, and to pass on this tradition to her children. In 1993 she travelled with her sister to Saint Neots in Cambridgeshire because her father-in-law was dying. She was able to park on waste ground for two weeks, but had to move on shortly after the funeral.', 'B. The application for planning permission', '14. On 4 December 1989 the applicant applied retrospectively to South Cambridgeshire District Council for planning permission for the three caravans on her site.', 'She was refused on 8 March 1990 on the grounds that (1) adequate provision had been made for Gypsy caravans elsewhere in the South Cambridgeshire area, which had in the Council\'s opinion reached ""saturation point"" for Gypsy accommodation; (2) the planned use of the land would detract from the rural and open quality of the landscape, contrary to the aim of the local development plan which was to protect the countryside from all but essential development (see paragraph 30 below); and (3) Meadow Drove was an agricultural drove road which was too narrow to allow two vehicles to pass in safety.', '15. On 9 April 1990 the Council issued an enforcement notice requiring the caravans to be removed within a month.', 'The applicant appealed against the enforcement notice to the Secretary of State for the Environment (see paragraph 33 below).', '16. An inspector was appointed by the Secretary of State to report on the appeal (see paragraph 33 below). The inspector visited the site and considered written representations submitted by the applicant and the District Council.', ""In her report issued on 14 February 1991 the inspector observed that the local authority had granted planning permission to two caravan sites between the applicant's site and Meadow Drove (the applicant's sister's site and another), and to an agricultural workshop on land to the east of the site (which was occupied at the time of the inspection by an unauthorised road haulage business). The applicant's caravans were screened from the road because of these authorised and unauthorised developments. However, the inspector wrote that:"", '""... whether seen or not, the development subject of these notices [i.e. the applicant\'s caravan site] extends development further from the road than that permitted. It thus intrudes into the open countryside, contrary to the aim of the Structure Plan [see paragraph 30 below] to protect the countryside from all but essential development."" The inspector also found that the access road to the site was too narrow for two vehicles to pass, and thus that the use of the site for caravans would not be in the interests of road safety. She considered the applicant\'s special status as a Gypsy and observed that in January 1990 there were over sixty Gypsy families on unauthorised sites in the district of South Cambridgeshire. She continued: ""It is therefore clear in my mind that a need exists for more authorised spaces. ... Nevertheless, I consider it important to keep concentrations of sites for gypsies small, because in this way they are more readily accepted by the local community. ... [T]he concentration of gypsy sites in Willingham has reached the desirable maximum and I do not consider that the overall need for sites should, in this case, outweigh the planning objections.""', 'She concluded by recommending that the appeal be dismissed.', '17. The Secretary of State dismissed the appeal on 16 April 1991. The reasons given included the following:', '""The decisive issue in regard to the planning merits of your appeals is considered to be whether the undisputed need for additional gypsies\' caravan site provision, in the administrative areas of the District Council, and of the County Council, is so pressing that it should be permitted to override the objections on planning policy and highway safety grounds to the retention of the use of the appeal site as a residential caravan site for gypsies. On this approach, the view is taken that the objections to the continued use of the appeal site as a residential gypsy caravan site are so strong, on planning policy and highway safety grounds, that a grant of planning permission could not be justified, either on a temporary or personal basis. In reaching this conclusion, full consideration has been given to policy advice in the Department\'s Circular 28/77, giving guidance to Councils on the need to provide adequate accommodation in the form of caravan sites, for gypsies residing in or resorting to their area. However, on the available evidence, the view is taken, in agreement with the officer\'s appraisal, that the concentration of gypsy caravan sites around the Willingham area has reached the desirable maximum, and the overall need for additional sites should not outweigh the planning and highway objections arising from the continued use of this particular site.""', 'The applicant did not appeal to the High Court because she was advised by counsel that no grounds arose in her case (see paragraph 34 below).', 'C. Criminal proceedings against the applicant', '18. The applicant has been prosecuted for failure to comply with the enforcement notice of May 1990. On 7 January 1992 she was fined £50 and required to pay £10 costs. She has again been prosecuted on two occasions after the introduction of her application to the Commission on 7 February 1992. On 12 January 1994 the magistrates granted her an absolute discharge but ordered her to pay the prosecution costs. Finally, on 16 November 1994 she was fined £75 and ordered to pay £75 costs.', 'D. Designation', '19. By a letter dated 20 May 1993, the Department of the Environment informed the District Council that the Secretary of State had decided to designate the area of South Cambridgeshire under section 12 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (see paragraph 37 below). It was noted that a small number of Gypsies still remained on unauthorised sites but that, in light of the provision made for sites which was greater than in any other district, it was considered ""not expedient for adequate accommodation to be provided for Gypsies residing in or resorting to South Cambridgeshire district"". The order designating the district of South Cambridgeshire came into force on 13 August 1993, but no longer applies because of the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (see paragraph 41 below).', 'E. Subsequent developments', '20. On 19 September 1994 the applicant again applied for permission to station her caravans on her site, in the light of a change in the law (see paragraphs 40-42 below).', '21. She was refused on 14 November 1994 on the grounds that (1) local planning policy dictated that development in open countryside should be restricted and no evidence to justify a departure from this policy had been advanced, and (2) adequate provision for Gypsies had been made along Meadow Drove (see paragraph 24 below).', ""22. The applicant (together with others occupying the neighbouring sites) appealed against this decision to the Secretary of State. A report was prepared by an inspector in May 1995. The inspector considered, first, whether the continued use of the land as a Gypsy caravan site would detract from the rural nature of the area, and, secondly, if so, whether there were any special circumstances sufficient to outweigh this objection. She found that the road safety objection, which had been one of the grounds of refusal in April 1991 (see paragraph 16 above), no longer applied. With regard to the first question, the inspector found that the applicant had a mobile home, three touring caravans and three sheds on her site. These were hidden from the road by the caravans on the sites in front and by an agricultural engineering business, the same depth as the applicant's site to the east. They were visible from other vantage points but could be adequately screened by planting hedges. However, she concluded that:"", '""... the continued use of the rear plots considerably extends the depth of development south of the road. This intensification of use in itself inevitably detracts from the rural appearance and generally open character of the area, contrary to the objectives of national and local countryside policy. I must therefore conclude that the continued occupation of the land as gypsy caravan sites is harmful to the character and appearance of the countryside.""', 'With regard to the special circumstances of the case, in particular the applicant\'s Gypsy status, the inspector made the following observations. She described the applicant\'s site as ""clean, spacious and well-ordered"". By contrast, the council-run site on Meadow Drove (see paragraphs 24-26 below) was ""isolated, exposed and somewhat uncared for"". Nevertheless, it was', '""a relevant consideration that there is available alternative accommodation close by, which would enable the appellants to stay in the Willingham area and their children to continue at the local schools"".', 'On the other hand,', '""little weight [could] be given to the private sites at Cottenham. No substantive evidence was given by either the Council or the appellants as to whether plots were actually available there or their price"".', ""The inspector considered the impact of Circular 1/94 (see paragraph 43 below) on the applicant's case, but concluded that, although it placed greater emphasis on the provision of sites by Gypsies themselves, it was government policy that proposals for Gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors. She concluded that there had been no material changes since the last appeal was heard and the present appeal should therefore be dismissed."", ""23. Accepting the inspector's conclusions and recommendations, the Secretary of State dismissed the appeal on 12 December 1995. The applicant has filed an appeal to the High Court, which is now pending."", 'F. Authorised Gypsy sites in the district of South Cambridgeshire', ""24. In November 1992 the County Council opened an official Gypsy caravan site in Meadow Drove, about 700 metres away from the applicant's land. The site consists of fifteen pitches, each comprising a fenced, partially grassed area with hard standing for caravans and its own brick building containing a kitchen, shower and toilet. Each pitch is designed to accommodate one permanent caravan, one touring caravan, one lorry and one car. They are joined by a central road and the site stands in open countryside."", '25. Between November 1992 (when the site opened) and August 1995, twenty-eight vacancies have arisen there. The District Council contacted the applicant by letters dated 17 February 1992 and 20 January 1994, informing her of the possible availability of pitches on this site and advising her to apply for one to the County Council. The applicant has never taken any action in this regard.', ""26. Since the site opened, the following incidents have reportedly taken place there: (1) an unsubstantiated allegation in May 1993 that one of the residents was in possession of a firearm; (2) a fight in December 1993 during which a resident on the site was punched in the eye by another; (3) in 1994 a car was brought on to the site and set alight; (4) in the same year there was an incident of domestic violence; (5) also in 1994, the warden's office on the site was burgled and damaged when temporarily vacant; (6) in 1995 a site resident was convicted of conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace after exchanging words and threatening gestures with a District Council refuse collector on the site; (7) in March 1995 four pitches were damaged by vandalism and/or fire."", '27. There are authorised privately run sites at Smithy Fen, Cottenham, about 7 kilometres from Willingham. In May 1995 the cost of purchasing a pitch on one of them reportedly varied between £7,000 and £40,000.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE', 'A. General planning law', '28. The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) (""the 1990 Act"") consolidated pre-existing planning law.', '29. It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (section 57 of the 1990 Act). A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development (Restormel Borough Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Rabey [1982] Journal of Planning Law 785; John Davies v. Secretary of State for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [1989] Journal of Planning Law 601).', '30. An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority, which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 54A of the 1990 Act). The local development plan in South Cambridgeshire restricts development in the countryside to that essential to the efficient operation of particular rural uses, such as horticulture, agriculture and forestry.', ""31. The 1990 Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State in the event of a refusal of permission (section 78). With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, para. 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State's decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288)."", '32. If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission, the local authority may issue an ""enforcement notice"", if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations (section 172 (1) of the 1990 Act).', '33. There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State on the grounds, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question (section 174). As with the appeal against refusal of permission, the Secretary of State must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector.', '34. Again there is a further right of appeal ""on a point of law"" to the High Court against a decision of the Secretary of State under section 174 (section 289). Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review. It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector\'s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority.', 'B. Gypsy caravan sites provision', '1. The Caravan Sites Act 1968', '35. Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (""the 1968 Act"") was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to Gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years. Section 16 defined ""gipsies"" as: ""persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or of persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling together as such"".', '36. Section 6 of the 1968 Act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities: ""to exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or resorting to their area"". The Secretary of State could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary (section 9).', '37. Where the Secretary of State was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of Gypsies, or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision, he could ""designate"" that district or county (section 12 of the 1968 Act). The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any Gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway, on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier (section 10). In addition, section 11 of the 1968 Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates\' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section 10.', '2. The Cripps Report', '38. By the mid-1970s it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section 6 of the 1968 Act was inadequate, and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems. In February 1976, therefore, the Government asked Sir John Cripps to carry out a study into the operation of the 1968 Act. He reported in July 1976 (Accommodation for Gypsies: A report on the working of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, ""the Cripps Report""). Sir John estimated that there were approximately 40,000 Gypsies living in England and Wales. He found that: ""Six-and-a-half years after the coming into operation of Part II of the 1968 Act, provision exists for only one-quarter of the estimated total number of gypsy families with no sites of their own. Three-quarters of them are still without the possibility of finding a legal abode ... Only when they are travelling on the road can they remain within the law: when they stop for the night they have no alternative but to break the law."" The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation.', '3. Circular 28/77', '39. Circular 28/77 was issued by the Department of the Environment on 25 March 1977. Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on ""statutory procedures, alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management"". It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of the Cripps Report. Among other advice, it encouraged local authorities to enable self-help by Gypsies through the adoption of a ""sympathetic and flexible approach to [Gypsies\'] applications for planning permission and site licences"". Making express reference to cases where Gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming, it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area.', '4. Circular 57/78', '40. Circular 57/78, which was issued on 15 August 1978, stated, inter alia, that ""it would be to everyone\'s advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation"", and thus advised local authorities that ""the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions"". In addition, approximately £100 million was spent under a scheme by which one hundred per cent grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating Gypsy sites.', '5. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994', '41. Section 80 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (""the 1994 Act""), which came into force on 3 November 1994, repealed sections 6-12 of the 1968 Act (see paragraphs 35-37 above) and the grant scheme referred to in paragraph 40 above.', '42. Section 77 of the 1994 Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move. An unauthorised camper is defined as ""a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway, any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner\'s consent"". Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable, or re-entry upon the land within three months, is a criminal offence. Local authorities are able to apply to a magistrates\' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction (section 78 of the 1994 Act).', '6. Circular 1/94', '43. New guidance on Gypsy sites and planning, in the light of the 1994 Act, was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular 1/94 (5 January 1994), which cancelled Circular 57/78 (see paragraph 40 above). Councils were told that:', '""In order to encourage private site provision, local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development. ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves, to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control."" However: ""As with other planning applications, proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors. Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations, the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural, archaeological, countryside, environmental, and Green Belt policies ...""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', ""44. In her application (no. 20348/92) of 7 February 1992 to the Commission, Mrs Buckley alleged that she was prevented from living with her family in caravans on her own land and from following the traditional lifestyle of a Gypsy, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). 45. On 3 March 1994 the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 11 January 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31) the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) (seven votes to five). The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '46. In their memorial the Government requested the Court ""to decide and declare that the facts [disclosed] no breach of the applicant\'s rights under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8)"". The applicant requested the Court ""to decide and declare that the facts [disclosed] a breach of [her] rights under Article 8 (art. 8) and/or Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+8)"" and to award her just satisfaction.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. SCOPE OF THE CASE BEFORE THE COURT', ""A. Applicant's complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 8 (art. 14+8)"", '47. In her application to the Commission, the applicant claimed that the designation system under the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (see paragraph 37 above) and the criminalisation of ""unauthorised camping"" under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (see paragraph 42 above) discriminated against Gypsies by preventing them from pursuing their traditional lifestyle. In its report the Commission did not express an opinion on this point. The Commission\'s Delegate, speaking at the Court\'s hearing, stated that the Commission had come to the conclusion that it could not examine the complaint as such because the applicant could not show that she had been directly and immediately affected by either of the Acts in question.', ""48. Although the Commission considered the case only under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), this additional complaint is encompassed in the Commission's decision declaring the application admissible. The Court accordingly has jurisdiction to examine it (see the Philis v. Greece judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 19, para. 56)."", 'B. Applicant\'s ""formal objections""', '49. At the Court\'s hearing on 19 February 1996, the Government mentioned, in support of their contention that the applicant had had available to her sufficient procedural safeguards, that the applicant did not appeal to the High Court against the Secretary of State\'s decision of 16 April 1991 (see paragraph 17 above). In a letter received at the registry on 21 February 1996, the applicant\'s solicitor sought to place on record ""formal objections"" against the Government\'s reliance on that fact. The Government had based no preliminary objection on it at any time prior to the Court\'s hearing. Accordingly, any such objection should be dismissed as out of time (Rule 48 para. 1 of Rules of Court A) and barred by estoppel.', '50. The Court observes that the applicant decided not to bring an appeal before the competent court after being advised by counsel that such an appeal was bound to fail (see paragraph 17 above). However, as indicated above, the Government have not framed their comment as a preliminary objection. It is an argument going to the merits, to be considered by the Court at the appropriate juncture (see paragraph 79 below).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 8)', '51. The applicant submitted that since she was prevented from living in caravans on her own land with her family and from following a travelling life there had been, and continued to be, a violation of her right to respect for her private and family life and her home. She relied on Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), which provides as follows:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', 'The Government contested this argument but the Commission accepted it.', 'A. Whether a right protected by Article 8 (art. 8) is in issue', '52. The Government disputed that any of the applicant\'s rights under Article 8 (art. 8) was in issue. In its contention, only a ""home"" legally established could attract the protection of that provision (art. 8).', '53. In the submission of the applicant and the Commission there was nothing in the wording of Article 8 (art. 8) or in the case-law of the Court or Commission to suggest that the concept of ""home"" was limited to residences which had been lawfully established. They considered, in addition, that since the traditional Gypsy lifestyle involved living in caravans and travelling, the applicant\'s ""private life"" and ""family life"" were also concerned.', '54. The Court, in its Gillow v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 November 1986 (Series A no. 109), noted that the applicants had established the property in question as their home, had retained ownership of it intending to return there, had lived in it with a view to taking up permanent residence, had relinquished their other home and had not established any other in the United Kingdom. That property was therefore to be considered their ""home"" for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8) (loc. cit., p. 19, para. 46). Although in the Gillow case the applicant\'s home had initially been established legally, similar considerations apply in the present case. The Court is satisfied that the applicant bought the land to establish her residence there. She has lived there almost continuously since 1988 - save for an absence of two weeks, for family reasons, in 1993 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) - and it has not been suggested that she has established, or intends to establish, another residence elsewhere. The case therefore concerns the applicant\'s right to respect for her ""home"".', '55. In view of the above conclusion it is unnecessary for the Court to decide whether the case also concerns the applicant\'s right to respect for her ""private life"" and ""family life"".', 'B. Whether there was an ""interference by a public authority""', '56. The applicant asked the Court to review the designation regime under the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (see paragraphs 35-37 above), which in her contention made it extremely difficult for Gypsies to follow their traditional lifestyle, and the criminalisation of ""unauthorised campers"" by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (see paragraphs 41-42 above), which, she submitted, was even more restrictive.', ""57. The Commission considered that it was empowered only to examine the applicant's complaints in so far as she had been directly affected by the measures in question. Neither the Caravan Sites Act 1968 nor the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 had ever been applied to the detriment of the applicant."", '58. The Government submitted that ""to the extent that there [had] been any interference with the applicant\'s rights under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1)"", such interference consisted of the enforcement against her of planning controls.', ""59. It not being the Court's task to review legislation in the abstract, the Court will confine itself as far as possible to examining the specific issues raised by the case before it (see, as a recent authority, the Bellet v. France judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 333-B, p. 42, para. 34). It does not appear that any measures based on either the Caravan Sites Act 1968 or the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 have ever been taken against the applicant. What is more, the order designating South Cambridgeshire entered into force only on 13 August 1993 (see paragraph 19 above), well after the enforcement notice (9 April 1990 - see paragraph 15 above) and the decision of the Secretary of State (16 April 1991 - see paragraph 17 above). It is not therefore within the competence of the Court to entertain those of the applicant's claims which are based on these Acts."", '60. On the other hand, the applicant was refused the planning permission which would have allowed her to live in the caravans on her land, was required to remove the caravans and prosecuted for failing to do so (see paragraphs 14-18 above), all pursuant to the relevant sections of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This undoubtedly constitutes ""interference by a public authority"" with the applicant\'s exercise of her right to respect for her home (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Gillow judgment, p. 19, para. 47).', 'C. Whether the interference was ""in accordance with the law""', '61. It was not contested that the measures to which the applicant was subjected were ""in accordance with the law"". The Court finds no cause to arrive at a different conclusion.', 'D. Whether the interference pursued a ""legitimate aim""', ""62. According to the Government, the measures in question were taken in the enforcement of planning controls aimed at furthering highway safety, the preservation of the environment and public health. The legitimate aims pursued were therefore public safety, the economic well-being of the country, the protection of health and the protection of the rights of others. The Commission accepted this in substance but noted that the aspect of highway safety, which figured prominently in the Council's decisions of 8 March 1990, the inspector's report of 14 February 1991 and, by implication, the Secretary of State's decision of 16 April 1991 (see paragraphs 14-17 above), was no longer relied on in later decisions. The applicant did not dispute that the authorities had acted in the furtherance of a legitimate aim."", '63. On the facts of the case the Court sees no reason to doubt that the measures in question pursued the legitimate aims stated by the Government.', 'E. Whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society""', '1. Arguments before the Court', '(a) The applicant', '64. The applicant accepted that Gypsies should not be immune from planning controls but argued that the burden placed on her was disproportionate. She stated that, seeking to act within the law, she had purchased the site to provide a safe and stable environment for her children and to be near the school they were attending.', ""65. She drew attention to the fact that at the time of the events complained of, the official site further down Meadow Drove had not yet opened. In any event, the official site had since proved unsuitable for a single woman with children. There had been reports of crime and violence there and the inspector's report of May 1995 had noted that the site was bleak and exposed (see paragraph 22 above). In the circumstances, therefore, the official site could not be considered an acceptable alternative for the applicant's own site. On the other hand, the same report had noted that the applicant's site was well maintained. It could also be adequately screened by vegetation, which would lessen its visual impact on the countryside."", '66. Finally, the applicant considered that there was no further alternative open to her as the cost of stationing her caravans on a private site in the vicinity was prohibitive.', '(b) The Government', '67. The Government noted that planning laws were necessary in a modern society for the preservation of urban and rural landscape. This reflected the needs of the entire population. In assessing the need for particular measures, the domestic authorities required a wide margin of appreciation. In the present context, it was necessary to construe Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) consistently with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), which allowed the State, amongst other things, to enforce such laws as it deemed necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest.', '68. National law was designed to achieve a fair balance between the interests of individuals and those of the community as a whole. In particular, it provided for a quasi-judicial procedure allowing individuals to challenge planning decisions (see paragraph 31 above); this procedure, moreover, had been found by the Court in its Bryan judgment cited above to meet the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6).', ""69. In so far as it was necessary to afford Gypsies special protection, this need had been taken into account. The Government had provided legislation and guidelines requiring authorities involved in the planning process to have particular regard to the specific constraints imposed by Gypsy life (see paragraphs 35-37 and 39 above). Moreover, Gypsies' accommodation needs were met by local authorities through the provision of authorised caravan sites and by advising Gypsies on the prospects of planning permission for private sites. In the applicant's case, the reports of the inspectors showed that her Gypsy status had been weighed in her favour, as indeed was required by the pertinent guidelines (see paragraph 16 above). In any event, it was unacceptable to exempt any section of the community from planning controls, or to allow any group the benefit of more lenient standards than those to which the general population was subject."", ""70. The applicant had had sufficient alternative options open to her. She had been invited to apply for a pitch on the official site further down Meadow Drove, both before and after it opened (see paragraph 25 above). She had failed to do so on each occasion. The Government denied that crime and violence were rife there; in any event, in so far as the applicant's failure was based on such allegations, it was clear that they could not have been material considerations before the site had even opened. Moreover, in the Government's contention, sufficient private sites were available in the area (see paragraph 27 above), most of them owned by Gypsies. The true position was that the applicant had consistently refused to countenance living anywhere else than on her own land. Finally, the sanctions which had been applied to the applicant had been limited to small fines (see paragraph 18 above)."", '(c) The Commission', ""71. The Commission submitted that Gypsies following a traditional lifestyle required special consideration in planning matters and considered that this had been recognised by the Government. In the specific circumstances of the applicant's case, however, a proper balance had not been achieved."", ""72. The area in question had not been singled out for special protection, whether as a national park, as an area of outstanding natural beauty or as a green belt. The stationing of caravans on the frontage of the site had been authorised, as had the erection of buildings belonging to an agricultural engineering business on neighbouring land (see paragraph 16 above). An official Gypsy caravan site had been opened further down Meadow Drove (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, the inspector, in her report of May 1995, had found that the applicant's site could be adequately screened from view by planting hedges (see paragraph 22 above)."", '73. For the same reasons as given by the applicant, the Commission accepted that the applicant could not be required to move to the official site further down Meadow Drove. It further accepted that the space available on other official caravan sites in the South Cambridgeshire area was insufficient (see paragraph 16 above). Nor could the applicant be required to move to a private authorised site, the inspector herself having expressed doubts as to the availability of plots on such sites and their price (see paragraph 22 above).', ""2. The Court's assessment"", '(a) General principles', '74. As is well established in the Court\'s case-law, it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the ""necessity"" for an interference, as regards both the legislative framework and the particular measure of implementation (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, para. 59, and the Miailhe v. France (no. 1) judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-C, p. 89, para. 36). Although a margin of appreciation is thereby left to the national authorities, their decision remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention. The scope of this margin of appreciation is not identical in each case but will vary according to the context (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Leander judgment, ibid.). Relevant factors include the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities concerned.', '75. The Court has already had occasion to note that town and country planning schemes involve the exercise of discretionary judgment in the implementation of policies adopted in the interest of the community (in the context of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), see the Bryan judgment cited above, p. 18, para. 47; in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), see the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, para. 69; the Erkner and Hofauer v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117, pp. 65-66, paras. 74-75 and 78; the Poiss v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117, p. 108, paras. 64-65, and p. 109, para. 68; the Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, p. 17, para. 57, and p. 19, para. 63). It is not for the Court to substitute its own view of what would be the best policy in the planning sphere or the most appropriate individual measure in planning cases (see, mutatis mutandis, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 49). By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, the national authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation.', '76. The Court cannot ignore, however, that in the instant case the interests of the community are to be balanced against the applicant\'s right to respect for her ""home"", a right which is pertinent to her and her children\'s personal security and well-being (see the above-mentioned Gillow judgment, p. 22, para. 55). The importance of that right for the applicant and her family must also be taken into account in determining the scope of the margin of appreciation allowed to the respondent State. Whenever discretion capable of interfering with the enjoyment of a Convention right such as the one in issue in the present case is conferred on national authorities, the procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. Indeed it is settled case-law that, whilst Article 8 (art. 8) contains no explicit procedural requirements, the decision-making process leading to measures of interference must be fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (art. 8) (see the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55, para. 87).', ""77. The Court's task is to determine, on the basis of the above principles, whether the reasons relied on to justify the interference in question are relevant and sufficient under Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."", '(b) Application of the above principles', '78. The applicant complained about the rejection of her appeal against the enforcement notice.', ""79. The law governing the decision-making process leading to the contested decision entitled the applicant to appeal to the Secretary of State on the ground, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted. Moreover, the appeal procedure comprised an assessment by a qualified independent expert, the inspector, to whom the applicant was entitled to make representations (see paragraphs 16 and 33 above). The Court is satisfied that the procedural safeguards provided for in the regulatory framework were therefore such as to afford due respect to the applicant's interests under Article 8 (art. 8). Subsequent judicial review by the High Court was also available, notably in so far as the applicant felt that the inspector (or the Secretary of State) had not taken into account relevant considerations or had based the contested decision on irrelevant considerations (see paragraph 34 above). In the event, the applicant declined to appeal to the High Court on the advice of counsel that such an appeal was bound to fail (see paragraph 17 above)."", ""80. In the instant case, an investigation was carried out by the inspector, who actually saw the land for herself and considered written representations submitted by the applicant and the District Council (see paragraph 16 above). In conformity with government policy, as set out in Circulars 28/77 and 57/78 (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above), the special needs of the applicant as a Gypsy following a traditional lifestyle were taken into account. The inspector and later the Secretary of State had regard to the shortage of Gypsy caravan sites in the area and weighed the applicant's interest in being allowed to continue living on her land in caravans against the general interest of conforming to planning policy (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). They found the latter interest to have greater weight given the particular circumstances pertaining to the area in question. Thus, in her report the inspector stated:"", '""... [the applicant\'s caravan site] extends development further from the road than that permitted. It thus intrudes into the open countryside, contrary to the aim of the Structure Plan to protect the countryside from all but essential development.""', 'and:', '""It is ... clear in my mind that a need exists for more authorised spaces. ... Nevertheless, I consider it important to keep concentrations of sites for gypsies small, because in this way they are more readily accepted by the local community. ... [T]he concentration of gypsy sites in Willingham has reached the desirable maximum and I do not consider that the overall need for sites should, in this case, outweigh the planning objections.""', ""The Secretary of State's reasoning in his decision included the following:"", '""The decisive issue in regard to the planning merits of your appeals is considered to be whether the undisputed need for additional gypsies\' caravan site provision, in the administrative areas of the District Council, and of the County Council, is so pressing that it should be permitted to override the objections on planning policy and highway safety grounds to the retention of the use of the appeal site as a residential caravan site for gypsies. On this approach, the view is taken that the objections to the continued use of the appeal site as a residential gypsy caravan site are so strong, on planning policy and highway safety grounds, that a grant of planning permission could not be justified, either on a temporary or personal basis. In reaching this conclusion, full consideration has been given to policy advice in the Department\'s Circular 28/77, giving guidance to Councils on the need to provide adequate accommodation in the form of caravan sites, for gypsies residing in or resorting to their area.""', ""81. The applicant was offered the opportunity, first in February 1992 and again in January 1994, to apply for a pitch on the official caravan site situated about 700 metres from the land which she currently occupies (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). Evidence has been adduced which tends to show that the alternative accommodation available at this location was not as satisfactory as the dwelling which she had established in contravention of the legal requirements (see paragraph 26 above). However, Article 8 (art. 8) does not necessarily go so far as to allow individuals' preferences as to their place of residence to override the general interest."", ""82. It is also true that subsequently, in her report of July 1995, the second inspector found that the applicant's caravans could have been adequately screened from view by planting hedges; this would have hidden them from view but, so the inspector concluded, would not have reduced their intrusion into open countryside in a way which national and local planning policy sought to prevent (see paragraph 22 above)."", '83. After the refusal of planning permission the applicant was fined relatively small sums for failing to remove her caravans (see paragraph 18 above). To date she has not been forcibly evicted from her land but has continued to reside there (see paragraph 7 above).', ""84. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that proper regard was had to the applicant's predicament both under the terms of the regulatory framework, which contained adequate procedural safeguards protecting her interest under Article 8 (art. 8), and by the responsible planning authorities when exercising their discretion in relation to the particular circumstances of her case. The latter authorities arrived at the contested decision after weighing in the balance the various competing interests in issue. As pointed out above (at paragraph 75), it is not the Court's task to sit in appeal on the merits of that decision. Although facts were adduced arguing in favour of another outcome at national level, the Court is satisfied that the reasons relied on by the responsible planning authorities were relevant and sufficient, for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8), to justify the resultant interference with the exercise by the applicant of her right to respect for her home. In particular, the means employed to achieve the legitimate aims pursued cannot be regarded as disproportionate. In sum, the Court does not find that in the present case the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation."", '(c) Conclusion', '85. In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 8 (art. 14+8)', '86. The applicant claimed to be the victim of discrimination on the ground of her Gypsy status, contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 8 (art. 14+8). Article 14 of the Convention (art. 14) provides:', '""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.""', 'In her contention, both the 1968 Act and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 prevented Gypsies from pursuing their traditional lifestyle by making it illegal for them to locate their caravans on unoccupied land.', '87. The Government denied that the applicant had been the victim of any difference of treatment. The Commission confined itself to noting that she had never been directly and immediately affected by either of the Acts in question.', ""88. The Court has already found (at paragraph 59 above) that it cannot consider any of the applicant's claims based on the Caravan Sites Act 1968 or the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. More generally, it does not appear that the applicant was at any time penalised or subjected to any detrimental treatment for attempting to follow a traditional Gypsy lifestyle. In fact, it appears that the relevant national policy was aimed at enabling Gypsies to cater for their own needs (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above)."", '89. That being so, the applicant cannot claim to have been the victim of discrimination contrary to Article 14 taken together with Article 8 (art. 14+8). Accordingly, there has been no violation under this head (art. 14+8).']",2,gb,001-58076,0

In 1988 criminal proceedings were brought, at the instigation of the Yonne Pharmacists ’ Association and several individual pharmacists, against the applicant and other managers of supermarkets in the region for unlawfully selling pharmaceutical products. He had sold in his shop aqueous eosin at 1% strength, 70% strength modified alcohol, 10-volume hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C (tablets of 500mg and sachets of powder of 1000mg), inhalations made out of plant essences, pocket inhalers, antiseptic sprays and mineral supplements.', 'In their defence the applicant and his fellow accused maintained that the products in question were not medicinal products within the meaning of Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code (see paragraph 18 below) and were accordingly not covered by the pharmacists ’ monopoly.', '9. On 30 September 1988 the Sens Criminal Court found the applicant guilty as charged, fined him 10,000 francs and ordered him to pay damages of 1 franc to each of the civil parties. After considering the products in question individually, it took the view that they were medicinal products, in some cases on account of their function and in others on account of their presentation (see paragraph 19 below).', 'B.

He contended that, especially when applied to parapharmaceutical products, the notion of medicinal product, as defined in the provisions on which his conviction had been based, was not sufficiently clear to enable him to determine with accuracy what acts would incur criminal liability.', 'On 29 May 1990 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in the following terms:', '""... the appellate court held, referring to the wording on the cardboard packaging and bottles containing the above-mentioned products, that these products were presented as being capable of contributing to the prevention and cure of human diseases and that, therefore, they constitute medicinal products within the meaning of Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code.', 'The Court of Appeal thus gave a proper legal basis for its decision without laying itself open to the complaints put forward ...

Case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities', '13. The Court of Justice of the European Communities has received several references for preliminary rulings concerning the interpretation of that definition. In its Van Bennekom judgment of 30 November 1983 (case 227/82 [1983] ECR 4 3883), it held as follows in respect of vitamin preparations:', '""It is ... necessary to take the view that a product is ‘ presented for treating or preventing disease ’ within the meaning of Directive 65/65 not only when it is expressly ‘ indicated ’ or ‘ recommended ’ as such, possibly by means of labels, leaflets or oral representation, but also whenever any averagely well-informed consumer gains the impression, which, provided it is definite, may even result from implication, that the product in question should, regard being had to its presentation, have an effect such as is described in the first part of the Community definition.', 'In particular the external form given to the product in question - such as that of a tablet, pill or capsule - may in this connection serve as strong evidence of the seller ’ s or manufacturer ’ s intention to market that product as a medicinal product. Such evidence cannot, however, be the sole or conclusive evidence, since otherwise certain food products which are traditionally presented in a similar form to pharmaceutical products would also be covered.', '... substances such as the vitamin preparations in issue, which are not ‘ indicated or recommended ’ expressly as being suitable for curing, treating or preventing an infection, may nonetheless constitute substances ‘ presented for treating or preventing disease ’ within the meaning of the Community definition of ‘ medicinal products ’ contained in Directive 65/65.', '...', 'It is ... apparent from the file and from the observations submitted to the Court, taken as a whole, that it is impossible in the present state of scientific knowledge to state whether the criterion of concentration alone is always sufficient in order to be able to determine whether a vitamin preparation constitutes a medicinal product; still less therefore is it possible to specify the level of concentration above which such a vitamin preparation would fall within the Community definition of a medicinal product.', 'The answer to be given to the national court should therefore be that the classification of a vitamin as a medicinal product within the meaning of the second part of the definition in Directive 65/65 must be carried out case by case, having regard to the pharmacological properties of each such vitamin to the extent to which they have been established in the present state of scientific knowledge."" (paragraphs 18-20 and 28-29)', '14. The Court of Justice has confirmed this approach on several occasions, clarifying certain points. Thus in its Delattre judgment of 21 March 1991 (C-369/88 [1991] ECR 1487), concerning eleven different products, including slimming products and preparations to combat tiredness, it stated:', '""... a product may be regarded as a medicinal product by virtue of its presentation if its form and the manner in which it is packaged render it sufficiently similar to a medicinal product and, in particular, if on its packing and the information provided with it reference is made to research by pharmaceutical laboratories or to methods or substances developed by medical practitioners or even to testimonials from medical practitioners commending the qualities of the product in question. A statement that a product is not a medicinal product is persuasive evidence which the national court may take into consideration, but it is not in itself conclusive."" (paragraph 41)', '15. In the Monteil and Samanni judgment of 21 March 1991 (60/89, [1991] ECR 1 1547), concerning 2% strength eosin and 70% strength modified alcohol, the Court of Justice held:', '""... the concept of ‘ presentation ’ of a product must be broadly construed and a product is ‘ presented for treating or preventing disease ’ within the meaning of Directive 65/65 not only when it is expressly ‘ indicated ’ or ‘ recommended ’ as such, possibly by means of labels, leaflets or oral representation, but also whenever any averagely well-informed consumer gains the impression, which, provided it is definite, may even result from implication, that the product in question should, having regard to its presentation, have the properties in question.', '... the external form given to the product in question may serve as strong evidence, but is not the sole or conclusive evidence; it must be stated that the ‘ form ’ must be taken to mean not only the form of the product itself but also that of its packaging, which may, for reasons of marketing policy, tend to make it resemble a medicinal product, and account must also be taken of the attitude of an averagely well-informed consumer, in whom the form given to a product may inspire particular confidence similar to that normally inspired in him by proprietary medicinal products, having regard to the safeguards normally associated with the manufacture and marketing of the latter type of product.', '...', '... it is for the national authorities to determine, subject to review by the courts, whether the eosin of a strength of 2% and modified alcohol of a strength of 70% constitute medicinal products by virtue of their function within the meaning of the second sub-paragraph of Article 1 (2) of Directive 65/65. In that regard, account must be taken of the adjuvants also entering into the composition of the product, the manner in which it is used, the extent of its distribution, its familiarity to consumers and the risks which its use may entail.', '...', '... although in principle the member States may reserve to pharmacists the right to make retail sales of products that fall within the Community definition of medicinal products and although, in those circumstances, their monopoly over those products may be presumed to constitute an appropriate way of protecting public health, evidence to the contrary may be produced with respect to certain products whose use would not involve any serious danger to public health and whose inclusion within the pharmacists ’ monopoly would seem manifestly disproportionate, that is to say contrary to the principles laid down by the Court for the interpretation of Articles 30 and 36 of the Treaty.', 'If pharmacists are granted a monopoly of other products, such as ‘ parapharmaceutical products ’, which may be of widely varying kinds, the need for such monopoly in order to protect public health or the health of consumers must, regardless of how the products concerned are classified under national law, be established in each individual case, and those two aims must not be obtainable by measures less restrictive of intra-Community trade.', 'It is for the national court to decide, having regard to those criteria, whether the action before it is well-founded."" (paragraphs 23-24, 29 and 43-45)', '16. In the Upjohn judgment of 16 April 1991 (C-112/89 [1991] 1 ECR 1703), the Court of Justice recalled that:', '""It is for the national court to determine on a case-by-case basis the classification of each product having regard to its pharmacological properties as they may be ascertained in the current state of scientific knowledge, to the way in which it is used, to the extent to which it is sold and to consumers ’ familiarity with it."" (paragraph 23)', '17. Finally in the Ter Voort judgment of 28 October 1992 (C-219/91 [1992] ECR 5485), the Court of Justice held:', '""... a product recommended or indicated as having prophylactic or therapeutic properties is a medicinal product within the meaning of the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of Directive 65/65, even if it is generally regarded as a foodstuff and even if in the current state of scientific knowledge it has no known therapeutic effect.', '...', 'The conduct, action and approaches of the manufacturer or the seller which disclose his intention to make the product he markets appear to be a medicinal product in the eyes of the averagely well-informed consumer may therefore be conclusive for the purposes of deciding whether a product should be regarded as a medicinal product by virtue of its presentation.""

Case-law', '19. On the basis of the above provisions the courts have classified products as medicinal products by virtue of their function, by virtue of their presentation or by virtue of their composition.', '20. According to the information provided to the Court, the courts sitting as tribunals of fact are divided on the question whether the products for whose sale the applicant was convicted are medicinal products within the meaning of Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code.', 'Thus vitamin C was classified as a medicinal product by the Courts of Appeal of Douai (9 April 1987), Poitiers (17 December 1987), Angers (5 May 1988) and Versailles (22 January 1996 in plenary session). However, decisions taking a contrary view were given by the Courts of Appeal of Douai (20 February 1988, 28 October 1988 and 23 March 1989), Angers (30 January 1989), Colmar (23 March 1988), Dijon (15 December 1988) and Paris (23 May 1995).', '70% strength alcohol was designated as a medicinal product by the Courts of Appeal of Poitiers (4 December 1986 and 28 January 1987), Aix-en-Provence (17 November 1987) and Colmar (23 March 1988), but not by the Courts of Appeal of Dijon (18 May 1988 - four judgments - and 15 December 1988), Limoges (18 November 1988), Paris (14 December 1988 and 21 February 1995) and Douai (23 March 1989).', 'Mineral supplements ( oligo-éléments ) have been regarded as medicinal products by the Courts of Appeal of Poitiers (17 December 1987) and Angers (5 May 1988), but not by those of Colmar (23 March 1988), Dijon (18 May and 15 December 1988), Angers (30 January 1989) and Douai (23 March 1989).', 'As regards 10-volume hydrogen peroxide and 1% or 2% strength eosin, the majority of the courts sitting as tribunals of fact consider that these products are mere hygiene products, for example, in respect of hydrogen peroxide, the Courts of Appeal of Colmar (23 March and 18 May 1988), Douai (28 October 1988) and Paris (14 December 1988); and, in respect of eosin, the Courts of Appeal of Dijon (18 May 1988) and Paris (14 December 1988 and 21 February 1995).', '21.

Mr Cantoni lodged his application with the Commission (application no. 17862/91) on 26 November 1990. He complained that the statutory definition of medicinal product lacked sufficient clarity and precision to satisfy the requirements of Article 7 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 7-1).', '23. The Commission declared the application admissible on 10 January 1994. In its report of 12 April 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fifteen votes to nine, that there had been a violation of that provision (art. 7-1). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '24. In their memorial to the Court, the Government ""called for the application to be dismissed"".', '25. At the hearing the applicant ’ s lawyers requested the Court to hold that Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code ""[was] not sufficiently precise to protect the rights of individuals in France "".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 7)', '26. The applicant complained of a violation of Article 7 of the Convention (art. 7), which is worded as follows:', '""1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article (art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.""', 'He maintained that the definition of medicinal product contained in Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code was very imprecise and left a wide discretion to the courts. The Court of Cassation ’ s case-law in this field was marked by arbitrariness and a lack of certainty which were themselves directly responsible for the conflicting classifications given to parapharmaceutical products by the lower courts. This state of affairs still persisted and concerned all the substances in question, whether hydrogen peroxide, 70% strength alcohol or vitamin C. The case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities was not particularly helpful because it left it to the national courts to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a substance should be classified as a medicinal product and referred to notions that themselves lacked precision and were not sufficiently technical.', 'In short, the definition found in the legislation and the case-law failed to afford the requisite foreseeability and accessibility. It followed that Mr Cantoni could not reasonably have been expected to appreciate, before putting the products in question up for sale, what constituted the material element of the offence in respect of which he was prosecuted.', '27. The Commission in substance subscribed to the applicant ’ s view. It observed that, although the criteria developed by the Convention institutions with regard to other provisions could be transposed to the field of application of Article 7 (art. 7), that provision (art. 7) nevertheless required that they be applied more strictly.', '28. Referring to the case-law of the Court, the Government argued that a law could be formulated in relatively general terms making it possible for its provisions to be adapted, through the process of interpretation, to changing situations. Even the most perfectly drafted law required a judge to clarify its limits and Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code was no exception.', 'The definition given in Article L. 511 was based in particular on extensive case-law concerning the notion of medicinal product and was no more open to criticism than any other statutory definition. Indeed it was actually far more precise than many of the definitions to be found in the Criminal Code. Above all, the legislature had no alternative but to have recourse to such a definition because to date no more satisfactory definition of medicinal product had been established. The only other solution - the drawing up of exhaustive lists - was not practicable because in this field there were thousands of different products and their number varied on an almost daily basis. A list would therefore never correspond to the reality. Indeed this explained why in its Directive 65/65 the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community had adopted the French approach, a solution for which the majority of the States of the European Union had subsequently opted. A finding that Article L. 511 was defective would therefore amount to making the same finding in respect of Directive 65/65.', 'In addition, the definition of medicinal product had given rise to hardly any problems in the criminal courts until the end of the 1980s. The disputes that occurred at that time had been created artificially and deliberately by supermarket chains. They had succeeded in disorientating some of the lower courts, but not the Court of Cassation, which had applied the same principles for more than a century.', '29. As the Court has already held, Article 7 (art. 7) embodies, inter alia, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision (art. 7) and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.', 'When speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statutory law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, as the most recent authority, the S.W. and C.R. v. the United Kingdom judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A nos. 335-B and 335-C, pp. 41-42, para. 35, and pp. 68-69, para. 33, respectively). In the present case only that last aspect is in issue.', '30. The fact, pointed to by the Government, that Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code is based almost word for word on Community Directive 65/65 (see paragraph 12 above) does not remove it from the ambit of Article 7 of the Convention (art. 7).', '31. As the Court has already had occasion to note, it is a logical consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application that the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, among other authorities, the Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 19, para. 40).', '32. Like many statutory definitions, that of ""medicinal product"" contained in Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code is rather general (see paragraph 18 above). When the legislative technique of categorisation is used, there will often be grey areas at the fringes of the definition. This penumbra of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not in itself make a provision incompatible with Article 7 (art. 7), provided that it proves to be sufficiently clear in the large majority of cases. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice.', 'The Court must accordingly ascertain whether in the present case the text of the statutory rule read in the light of the accompanying interpretive case-law satisfied this test at the relevant time.', '33. In the applicant ’ s submission, other solutions were available to the authorities, such as recourse to exhaustive lists of medicinal products. It is, however, not for the Court to express a view on the appropriateness of methods chosen by the legislature of a Contracting State; its task is confined to determining whether they are in conformity with the Convention.', '34. Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument based on the decisions of the lower courts cited by the applicant and concerning the type of ""borderline"" product for the sale of which he was convicted. There were indeed divergencies in the decisions of the lower courts (see paragraph 20 above). According to the Government, these may be explained essentially by the fact that the comparisons of decisions did not take account of prosecutions brought in respect of different concentrations of the products in question.', 'The Court notes in the first place that the applicant did not indicate whether the decisions cited classified these products as medicinal products by virtue of their function or by virtue of their presentation, and, in the latter case, whether the presentation was the same on each occasion.', 'Even assuming that the decisions dealt with identical cases, the questions before the lower courts were principally questions of fact. For the first category of decisions, concerning products regarded as medicinal by virtue of their function, it was essentially a matter of establishing the current state of scientific knowledge. For the second category, that is decisions relating to products regarded as medicinal by virtue of their presentation, the courts aimed to gauge the impression gained by the averagely well-informed consumer.', 'Moreover, there is, in the Court ’ s view, one decisive consideration. From, at the latest, 1957 onwards the Court of Cassation has always either confirmed the decisions of the courts below classifying a parapharmaceutical -type product as medicinal or quashed decisions which denied that classification. It has never upheld a decision by a lower court finding that such a product fell outside the notion of medicinal product (see paragraph 21 above). Thus, well before the events in the present case, the Court of Cassation had adopted a clear position on this matter, which with the passing of time became even more firmly established.', '35. The Court recalls that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see the Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 26, para. 68). A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, p. 71, para. 37). This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails.', 'With the benefit of appropriate legal advice, Mr Cantoni, who was, moreover, the manager of a supermarket, should have appreciated at the material time that, in view of the line of case-law stemming from the Court of Cassation and from some of the lower courts, he ran a real risk of prosecution for unlawful sale of medicinal products.', '36. There has accordingly been no breach of Article 7 (art. 7).']",2,fr,001-58068,0

The applicant, Mr Nigel Wingrove, is a film director. He was born in 1957 and resides in London.', '8. Mr Wingrove wrote the shooting script for, and directed the making of, a video work entitled Visions of Ecstasy. Its running time is approximately eighteen minutes, and it contains no dialogue, only music and moving images. According to the applicant, the idea for the film was derived from the life and writings of St Teresa of Avila, the sixteenth-century Carmelite nun and founder of many convents, who experienced powerful ecstatic visions of Jesus Christ.', '9. The action of the film centres upon a youthful actress dressed as a nun and intended to represent St Teresa. It begins with the nun, dressed loosely in a black habit, stabbing her own hand with a large nail and spreading her blood over her naked breasts and clothing. In her writhing, she spills a chalice of communion wine and proceeds to lick it up from the ground. She loses consciousness. This sequence takes up approximately half of the running time of the video. The second part shows St Teresa dressed in a white habit standing with her arms held above her head by a white cord which is suspended from above and tied around her wrists. The near-naked form of a second female, said to represent St Teresa ’ s psyche, slowly crawls her way along the ground towards her. Upon reaching St Teresa ’ s feet, the psyche begins to caress her feet and legs, then her midriff, then her breasts, and finally exchanges passionate kisses with her. Throughout this sequence, St Teresa appears to be writhing in exquisite erotic sensation. This sequence is intercut at frequent intervals with a second sequence in which one sees the body of Christ, fastened to the cross which is lying upon the ground. St Teresa first kisses the stigmata of his feet before moving up his body and kissing or licking the gaping wound in his right side. Then she sits astride him, seemingly naked under her habit, all the while moving in a motion reflecting intense erotic arousal, and kisses his lips. For a few seconds, it appears that he responds to her kisses. This action is intercut with the passionate kisses of the psyche already described. Finally, St Teresa runs her hand down to the fixed hand of Christ and entwines his fingers in hers. As she does so, the fingers of Christ seem to curl upwards to hold with hers, whereupon the video ends.', '10. Apart from the cast list which appears on the screen for a few seconds, the viewer has no means of knowing from the film itself that the person dressed as a nun in the video is intended to be St Teresa or that the other woman who appears is intended to be her psyche. No attempt is made in the video to explain its historical background.', '11. Visions of Ecstasy was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (""the Board""), being the authority designated by the Home Secretary under section 4 (1) of the Video Recordings Act 1984 (""the 1984 Act"" - see paragraph 24 below) as', '""the authority responsible for making arrangements (a) for determining, for the purposes of [the] Act whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them, having special regard to the likelihood of video works in respect of which such certificates have been issued being viewed in the home, (b) in the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements to be so suitable ( i ) for making such other determinations as are required for the issue of classification certificates, and (ii) for issuing such certificates ... ...""', '12. The applicant submitted the video to the Board in order that it might lawfully be sold, hired out or otherwise supplied to the general public or a section thereof.', '13. The Board rejected the application for a classification certificate on 18 September 1989 in the following terms:', '""Further to your application for a classification certificate ..., you are already aware that under the Video Recordings Act 1984 the Board must determine first of all whether or not a video work is suitable for such a certificate to be issued to it, having special regard to the likelihood of video works being viewed in the home. In making this judgment, the Board must have regard to the Home Secretary ’ s Letter of Designation in which we are enjoined to `continue to seek to avoid classifying works which are obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 or which infringe other provisions of the criminal law ’. Amongst these provisions is the criminal law of blasphemy, as tested recently in the House of Lords in R. v. Lemon (1979), commonly known as the Gay News case. The definition of blasphemy cited therein is ‘ any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible ... It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion ’ if the publication is ‘ decent and temperate ’. The question is not one of the matter expressed, but of its manner, i.e. `the tone, style and spirit ’, in which it is presented. The video work submitted by you depicts the mingling of religious ecstasy and sexual passion, a matter which may be of legitimate concern to the artist. It becomes subject to the law of blasphemy, however, if the manner of its presentation is bound to give rise to outrage at the unacceptable treatment of a sacred subject. Because the wounded body of the crucified Christ is presented solely as the focus of, and at certain moments a participant in, the erotic desire of St Teresa, with no attempt to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in an erotic experience, it is the Board ’ s view, and that of its legal advisers, that a reasonable jury properly directed would find that the work infringes the criminal law of blasphemy. To summarise, it is not the case that the sexual imagery in Visions of Ecstasy lies beyond the parameters of the `18 ’ category; it is simply that for a major proportion of the work ’ s duration that sexual imagery is focused on the figure of the crucified Christ. If the male figure were not Christ, the problem would not arise. Cuts of a fairly radical nature in the overt expressions of sexuality between St Teresa and the Christ figure might be practicable, but I understand that you do not wish to attempt this course of action. In consequence, we have concluded that it would not be suitable for a classification certificate to be issued to this video work.""', '14. The applicant appealed against the Board ’ s determination to the Video Appeals Committee (""the VAC"" - see paragraph 25 below), established pursuant to section 4 (3) of the 1984 Act. His notice of appeal, prepared by his legal representatives at the time, contained the following grounds:', '""( i ) that the Board was wrong to conclude that the video infringes the criminal law of blasphemy, and that a reasonable jury properly directed would so find; (ii) in particular, the Appellant will contend that upon a proper understanding of the serious nature of the video as an artistic and imaginative interpretation of the `ecstasy ’ or `rapture ’ of the sixteenth-century Carmelite nun, St Teresa of Avila, it would not be taken by a reasonable person as contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous or otherwise disparaging in relation to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible. The appeal will raise the question of mixed fact and law, namely whether publication of the video, even to a restricted degree, would contravene the existing criminal law of blasphemy.""', '15. The Board submitted a formal reply to the VAC explaining its decision in relation to its functions under section 4 of the 1984 Act:', '""The Act does not expressly set out the principles to be applied by the authority in determining whether or not a video work is suitable for a classification certificate to be issued in respect of it. In these circumstances, the Board has exercised its discretion to formulate principles for classifying video works in a manner which it believes to be both reasonable and suited to carrying out the broad objectives of the Act. Amongst these principles, the Board has concluded that an overriding test of suitability for classification is the determination that the video work in question does not infringe the criminal law. In formulating and applying this principle, the Board has consistently had regard to the Home Secretary ’ s Letter of Designation under the Video Recordings Act ... The Board has concluded on the advice of leading Counsel that the video work in question infringes the criminal law of blasphemy and that a reasonable jury properly directed on the law would convict accordingly. The Board submits and is advised that in Britain the offence of blasphemy is committed if a video work treats a religious subject (in particular God, Jesus Christ or the Bible) in such a manner as to be calculated (that is, bound, not intended) to outrage those who have an understanding of, sympathy towards and support for the Christian story and ethic, because of the contemptuous, reviling, insulting, scurrilous or ludicrous tone, style and spirit in which the subject is presented. The video work under appeal purports to depict the erotic fantasies of a character described in the credits as St Teresa of Avila. The 14-minute second section of the video work portrays ‘ St Teresa ’ having an erotic fantasy involving the crucified figure of Christ, and also a Lesbian erotic fantasy involving the ‘ Psyche of St Teresa ’. No attempt is made to place what is shown in any historical, religious or dramatic context: the figures of St Teresa and her psyche are both clearly modern in appearance and the erotic images are accompanied by a rock music backing. The work contains no dialogue or evidence of an interest in exploring the psychology or even the sexuality of the character purporting to be St Teresa of Avila. Instead, this character and her supposed fantasies about lesbianism and the body and blood of Christ are presented as the occasion for a series of erotic images of a kind familiar from ‘ soft-core ’ pornography. In support of its contentions, the Board refers to an interview given by the appellant and published in Midweek magazine on 14 September 1989. In this interview, the appellant attempts to draw a distinction between pornography and ‘ erotica ’, denying that the video work in question is pornographic but stating that `all my own work is actually erotica ’. Further on, the interviewer comments: `In many ways, though, Visions calls upon the standard lexicon of lust found in down market porn: nuns, lesbianism, women tied up (Gay Nuns in Bondage could have been an alternative title in fact). Nigel Wingrove flashes a wicked grin. `That ’ s right, and I ’ m not denying it. I don ’ t know what it is about nuns, it ’ s the same sort of thing as white stocking tops I suppose. ’ So why does he not consider Visions to be pornography, or at least soft porn? `I hope it is gentler, subtler than that. I suppose most people think pornography shows the sex act, and this doesn ’ t. ’ It is clear from the appellant ’ s own admissions that, whether or not the video work can rightly be described as pornographic, it is solely erotic in content, and it focuses this erotic imagery for much of its duration on the body and blood of Christ, who is even shown to respond to the sexual attentions of the principal character. Moreover, the manner in which such imagery is treated places the focus of the work less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience, which is the primary function of pornography whether or not it shows the sex act explicitly. Because there is no attempt, in the Board ’ s view, to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a voyeuristic erotic experience, the Board considers that the public distribution of such a video work would outrage and insult the feelings of believing Christians ... ... The Board ... submits that the appeal should be dismissed and its determination upheld.""', '16. The applicant then made further representations to the VAC, stating, inter alia:', '""The definition of the offence of blasphemy set out in ... the reply is too wide, being significantly wider than the test approved in the only modern authority - see Lemon & Gay News Ltd v. Whitehouse [1979] Appeal Cases 617, per Lord Scarman at 665. For example, there is no uniform law of blasphemy in Britain; the last recorded prosecution for blasphemy under the law of Scotland was in 1843 - see Thos Paterson [1843] I Brown 629. Nor is any religious subject protected - the reviling matter must be in relation to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. In the Appellant ’ s contention, these limitations are of the utmost significance in this case since the video is not concerned with anything which God or Jesus Christ did, or thought or might have approved of. It is about the erotic visions and imaginings of a sixteenth-century Carmelite nun - namely St Teresa of Avila. It is quite plain that the Christ figure exists in her fantasy as the Board expressly accepts ... The scurrilous and/or erotic treatment of religious subject matter has received the Board ’ s classification without attempted prosecution in recent years, e.g. Monty Python ’ s Life of Brian and Mr Scorsese ’ s The Last Temptation of Christ. ... The Board argues that the video is purely erotic or ‘ soft-core ’ pornographic, without historical, religious, dramatic or other artistic merit. The implication is that, had it possessed such merit the Board ’ s decision might very well have been otherwise. The Appellant will seek to argue and call evidence to the effect that the video work is a serious treatment of the subject of the ecstatic raptures of St Teresa (well chronicled in her own works and those of commentators) from a twentieth-century point of view. The so-called ‘ rock music backing ’ was in fact specially commissioned from the respected composer Steven Severin, after discussion of the Director ’ s desired artistic and emotional impact. The Board has based its decision upon the narrowest, most disparaging, critical appreciation of the work. The Appellant will contend that a very much more favourable assessment of his aims and achievement in making Visions of Ecstasy is, at the very least, tenable and that the Board ought not to refuse a certificate on a mere matter of interpretation. The Appellant takes objection to the Board ’ s quotation ... of comments attributed to him from an article by one Rob Ryan published in Midweek magazine 14th September 1989. The remarks are pure hearsay so far as the Board is concerned. That aside, the piece quoted is in large part the comments of the author of the article. An entirely misleading impression of what the Appellant said to the author is conveyed by the interpolation of the words attributed to him, and by taking this passage out of context. Above all, the Appellant disputes the key assertion by the Board that the video work is solely erotic in content.""', '17. The appeal was heard by a five-member panel of the VAC (""the Panel"") on 6 and 7 December 1989; oral and affidavit evidence was submitted. By a majority of three to two, a written decision rejecting the appeal was given on 23 December 1989. The Panel also considered itself bound by the criteria set out in the designation notice (see paragraph 24 below). It had difficulty, however, in ascertaining and applying the present law of blasphemy. It commented as follows:', '""The authorities on this Common Law offence were reviewed by the House of Lords in the case of Lemon and Gay News Ltd v. Whitehouse which concerned a magazine called Gay News, the readership of which consisted mainly of homosexuals although it was on sale to the general public at some bookstalls. One edition contained a poem entitled The Love that Dares to Speak its Name accompanied by a drawing illustrating its subject matter. In his judgment Lord Scarman said that it was unnecessary to speculate whether an outraged Christian would feel provoked by the words and illustration to commit a breach of the peace, the true test being whether the words are calculated to outrage and insult the Christian ’ s religious feelings, the material in question being contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England. It should perhaps be added that the word `calculated ’ should be read in the dictionary sense of `estimated ’ or `likely ’ as it was decided that intent (other than an intent to publish) is not an element in the offence. In the same case Lord Diplock said that the material must be `likely to arouse a sense of outrage among those who believe in or respect the Christian faith ’. In the present case the Board ’ s Director ... said in evidence that the Board ’ s view was that the video was `contemptuous of the divinity of Christ ’. He added that although the Board ’ s decision was based upon its view that the video is blasphemous (blasphemy being an offence which relates only to the Christian religion), it would take just the same stance if it were asked to grant a Certificate to a video which, for instance, was contemptuous of Mohammed or Buddha.""', '18. The Panel went on to review the content of the video and accepted that the applicant had in mind St Teresa, a nun, ""who is known to have had ecstatic visions of Christ although, incidentally, these did not start until she was 39 years of age - in marked contrast to the obvious youthfulness of the actress who plays the part"".', '19. The Panel reached the following conclusion:', '""From the writings of St Teresa herself, and the subsequent writings of others, there seems no reason to doubt that some of her visions were of seeing the glorified body of Christ and being shown his wounds but, even so, it seems clear that Mr Wingrove has taken considerable artistic licence with his subject. Apart from the age discrepancy - a comparatively minor matter - we were made aware of nothing which would suggest that Teresa ever did anything to injure her hand or that any element of lesbianism ever entered into her visions. More importantly, there seems nothing to suggest that Teresa, in her visions, ever saw herself as being in any bodily contact with the glorified Christ. As one author, Mr Stephen Clissold, puts it `Teresa experienced ecstasy as a form of prayer in which she herself played almost no part ’. So, in view of the extent of the artistic licence, we think it would be reasonable to look upon the video as centring upon any nun of any century who, like many others down the ages, had ecstatic visions. There is also another reason for taking this stance: unless the viewer happens to read the cast list which appears on the screen for a few seconds, he or she has no means of knowing that the nun is supposed to be St Teresa, nor that the figure of the second woman is supposed to be her psyche. And he or she in any event may well be unaware that Teresa was a real-life nun who had ecstatic visions. It is true that Mr Wingrove says that it is intended that the sleeve or jacket for the video will provide ‘ basic historical information to assist the viewer ’, but we feel bound to regard this as irrelevant. Firstly because it by no means follows that every viewer will read any such description; and secondly because the Board ’ s and the Appeal Panel ’ s decision must be based solely upon the video itself, quite apart from the fact that at the time of making a decision the sleeve or jacket is usually - as in the present instance - not even in existence. However, although we have thought it proper to dwell at some length with the ‘ St Teresa ’ aspect, we are of the opinion that in practice, when considering whether or not the video is blasphemous, it makes little or no difference whether one looks upon the central character as being St Teresa or any other nun. The appellant, in his written statement, lays stress upon the undoubted fact that the whole of the second half consists of Teresa ’ s vision or dream. Hence he says the video says nothing about Christ, his figure being used only as a projection of St Teresa ’ s mind, nor was it his intention to make that figure an active participant in any overt sexual act. He goes on to say `Rather the very mild responses are those of St Teresa ’ s conjecture: the kiss, hand clasp and ultimately the tears of Christ. To show no response to a creation of her own mind would be nonsense; no woman (nor man) whose deep love could cause such visions/ecstasies would imagine the object of that love coldly to ignore their caresses ’. Although we quite appreciate the logic of this point of view, we have reservations about the extent to which a vision or dream sequence can affect the question of whether what is pictured or said is blasphemous. It would, for instance, be possible to produce a film or video which was most extremely contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous in relation to Christ, all dressed up in the context of someone ’ s imaginings. In such circumstances we find it hard to envisage that, by such a simple device, it could reasonably be said that no offence had been committed. If in our opinion the viewer, after making proper allowance for the scene being in the form of a dream, nevertheless reasonably feels that it would cause a sense of outrage and insult to a Christian ’ s feelings, the offence would be established. We should perhaps also deal, albeit briefly, with a further submission made on behalf of the appellant, namely that the crime of blasphemy may extend only to the written or spoken word and hence that a court might rule that no film or video, and perhaps nothing shown on television, could become the subject of such a charge. Suffice it to say that in our view this is too unlikely to cause it to be taken into account by the Board or a panel of the Appeals Committee when reaching a decision. In the opinion of a majority of the Panel the video did not, as the appellant claims, explore St Teresa ’ s struggles against her visions but exploited a devotion to Christ in purely carnal terms. Furthermore they considered that it lacked the seriousness and depth of The Last Temptation of Christ with which Counsel for the appellant sought to compare it. Indeed the majority took the view that the video ’ s message was that the nun was moved not by religious ecstasy but rather by sexual ecstasy, this ecstasy being of a perverse kind - full of images of blood, sado -masochism, lesbianism (or perhaps auto- erotism ) and bondage. Although there was evidence of some element of repressed sexuality in St Teresa ’ s devotion to Christ, they did not consider that this gave any ground for portraying her as taking the initiative in indulged sexuality. They considered the over-all tone and spirit of the video to be indecent and had little doubt that all the above factors, coupled with the motions of the nun whilst astride the body of Christ and the response to her kisses and the intertwining of the fingers would outrage the feelings of Christians, who would reasonably look upon it as being contemptuous of the divinity of Christ. In these circumstances the majority were satisfied that the video is blasphemous, that a reasonable and properly directed jury would be likely to convict and therefore that the Board was right to refuse to grant a Certificate. Hence this appeal is accordingly dismissed. It should perhaps be added that the minority on the Panel, whilst being in no doubt that many people would find the video to be extremely distasteful, would have allowed the appeal because in their view it is unlikely that a reasonable and properly directed jury would convict.""', '20. As a result of the Board ’ s determination, as upheld by the Panel, the applicant would commit an offence under section 9 of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 23 below) if he were to supply the video in any manner, whether or not for reward.', '21. The applicant received legal advice that his case was not suitable for judicial review (see paragraphs 30-31 below) on the grounds that the formulation of the law of blasphemy, as accepted by the Panel, was an ""accurate statement of the present law"".', 'II. SITUATION OF THE VIDEO INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM', '22. According to statistics submitted by the Government, in 1994 there were 21.5 million video-recorders in the United Kingdom. Out of approximately 20.75 million households in the United Kingdom, 18 million contained at least one video-recorder. There were approximately 15,000 video outlets in the United Kingdom. Videos were available for hire in between 4,000 and 5,000 video rental shops. They were also available for sale in 3,000 ""high street"" shops and in between 7,000 and 8,000 ""secondary"" outlets such as supermarkets, corner shops and petrol stations. In 1994 there were 194 million video rentals and 66 million video purchases in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that a further 65 million illegal copies (""pirate videos"") were distributed during that year.']","['III. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The regulation of video works', '23. The Video Recordings Act 1984 (""the 1984 Act"") regulates the distribution of video works. Subject to certain exemptions, it is an offence under section 9 (1) of that Act for a person to supply or offer to supply a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued. Under section 7 there are three categories of classification: works deemed suitable for general viewing (and to which a parental guidance reference may be added); works for which the viewing is restricted to people who have attained a specified age; and works which may only be supplied by licensed sex shops. The Secretary of State for the Home Department may require that the content of certain works be labelled (section 8). It is an offence to ignore such conditions, for example by supplying someone under 18 years of age with an ""18"" classified work (section 11).', '24. Under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State may by notice designate any person or body as the authority for making arrangements for determining whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them (having special regard to the likelihood of certified video works being viewed in the home). By a notice dated 26 July 1985 the British Board of Film Classification was so designated. In the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements described above to be suitable for classification certificates, the Board is responsible under section 4 (1) for making arrangements for the issue of certificates and making other determinations relating to their use. The Secretary of State ’ s notice enjoined the Board ""to continue to seek to avoid classifying works which are obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 or which infringe other provisions of the criminal law"".', '25. Pursuant to section 4 (3) of the 1984 Act arrangements were made for the establishment of the Video Appeals Committee to determine appeals against decisions by the Board.', 'B. The law of blasphemy', '26. Blasphemy and blasphemous libel are common law offences triable on indictment and punishable by fine or imprisonment. Blasphemy consists in speaking and blasphemous libel in otherwise publishing blasphemous matter. Libel involves a publication in a permanent form, but that form may consist of moving pictures.', '27. In the case of Whitehouse v. Gay News Ltd and Lemon [1979] Appeal Cases 617 at 665, which concerned the law of blasphemy in England, Lord Scarman held that the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in Article 214 of Stephen ’ s Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th edition (1950). This states as follows:', '""Every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not to the substance of the doctrines themselves.""', 'The House of Lords in that case also decided that the mental element in the offence ( mens rea ) did not depend upon the accused having an intent to blaspheme. It was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the publication had been intentional and that the matter published was blasphemous. The Gay News case, which had been brought by a private prosecutor, had been the first prosecution for blasphemy since 1922.', '28. As stated above, the law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England. This was confirmed by the Divisional Court in 1991. Ruling on an application for judicial review of a magistrate ’ s refusal to issue a summons for blasphemy against Salman Rushdie and the publishers of The Satanic Verses, Lord Watkins stated:', '""We have no doubt that as the law now stands it does not extend to religions other than Christianity ... ... We think it right to say that, were it open to us to extend the law to cover religions other than Christianity, we should refrain from doing so. Considerations of public policy are extremely difficult and complex. It would be virtually impossible by judicial decision to set sufficiently clear limits to the offence, and other problems involved are formidable."" (R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 318)', '29. On 4 July 1989 the then Minister of State at the Home Department, Mr John Patten, had sent a letter to a number of influential British Muslims, in which he stated inter alia that:', '""Many Muslims have argued that the law of blasphemy should be amended to take books such as [The Satanic Verses] outside the boundary of what is legally acceptable. We have considered their arguments carefully and reached the conclusion that it would be unwise for a variety of reasons to amend the law of blasphemy, not the least the clear lack of agreement over whether the law should be reformed or repealed. ... ... an alteration in the law could lead to a rush of litigation which would damage relations between faiths. I hope you can appreciate how divisive and how damaging such litigation might be, and how inappropriate our legal mechanisms are for dealing with matters of faith and individual belief. Indeed, the Christian faith no longer relies on it, preferring to recognise that the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers.""', 'C. The availability of judicial review as a remedy', '30. Decisions by public bodies which have consequences which affect some person or body of persons are susceptible to challenge in the High Court on an application for judicial review. Amongst the grounds on which such a challenge may be brought is that the body in question misdirected itself on a point of law. The Video Appeals Committee is such a public body because it is established pursuant to an Act of Parliament (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, its decisions affect the rights of persons who make video works because confirmation of a decision that a video work cannot receive a classification certificate would mean that copies of that work could not be lawfully supplied to members of the public.', '31. On an application for judicial review a court would not normally look at the merits of any decision made by such a body, except where the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable body, properly instructed, could have reached it. However, where the decision is based on a point of law and it is alleged that the body has misdirected itself on that point, the decision could be challenged by an application for judicial review. In the case of C.C.S.U. v. Minister for the Civil Service [1984] 3 All England Law Reports at 950, Lord Diplock, in the House of Lords, classified under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. He called the first ground ""illegality"" and described it as follows:', '""By ‘ illegality ’ as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of a dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the State is exercisable.""', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '32. Mr Wingrove applied to the Commission on 18 June 1990. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), complaining that the refusal of a classification certificate for his video work Visions of Ecstasy was in breach of his freedom of expression.', '33. The Commission declared the application (no. 17419/90) admissible on 8 March 1994. In its report of 10 January 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fourteen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '34. In their final submissions, the Government requested the Court to declare that the facts of the present case disclose no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). The applicant, for his part, invited the Court to ""produce a judgment which declares the British blasphemy laws as unnecessary in theory as they are in practice in any multi-cultural democracy"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION (Art. 10)', '35. The applicant alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), which, in so far as relevant, provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ... 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '36. The refusal by the British Board of Film Classification to grant a certificate for the applicant ’ s video work Visions of Ecstasy, seen in conjunction with the statutory provisions making it a criminal offence to distribute a video work without this certificate (see paragraph 23 above), amounted to an interference by a public authority with the applicant ’ s right to impart ideas. This was common ground between the participants in the proceedings. To determine whether such an interference entails a violation of the Convention, the Court must examine whether or not it was justified under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) by reason of being a restriction ""prescribed by law"", which pursued an aim that was legitimate under that provision (art. 10-2) and was ""necessary in a democratic society"".', 'A. Whether the interference was ""prescribed by law""', '37. The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence. Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution. In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board ’ s speculations. The requirement of foreseeability which flows from the expression ""prescribed by law"" was therefore not fulfilled.', '38. The Government contested this claim: it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts. This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable. Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous.', '39. The Commission, noting that considerable legal advice was available to the applicant, was of the view that he could reasonably have foreseen the restrictions to which his video work was liable.', '40. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31).', '41. It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant ’ s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 198 4 Act (see paragraph 24 above).', '42. The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition. National authorities must therefore be afforded a degree of flexibility in assessing whether the facts of a particular case fall within the accepted definition of the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky judgment cited above at paragraph 40, p. 73, para. 41).', '43. There appears to be no general uncertainty or disagreement between those appearing before the Court as to the definition in English law of the offence of blasphemy, as formulated by the House of Lords in the case of Whitehouse v. Gay News Ltd and Lemon (see paragraph 27 above). Having seen for itself the content of the video work, the Court is satisfied that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen with appropriate legal advice that the film, particularly those scenes involving the crucified figure of Christ, could fall within the scope of the offence of blasphemy. The above conclusion is borne out by the applicant ’ s decision not to initiate proceedings for judicial review on the basis of counsel ’ s advice that the Panel ’ s formulation of the law of blasphemy represented an accurate statement of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 27, para. 60).', '44. Against this background it cannot be said that the law in question did not afford the applicant adequate protection against arbitrary interference. The Court therefore concludes that the impugned restriction was ""prescribed by law"".', 'B. Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim', '45. The applicant contested the Government ’ s assertion that his video work was refused a certificate for distribution in order to ""protect the right of citizens not to be offended in their religious feelings"". In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended. It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people ’ s viewing the video work without being shocked. In any event - the applicant further submitted - the restriction on the film ’ s distribution could not pursue a legitimate aim since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith.', '46. The Government referred to the case of Otto-Preminger- Institut v. Austria (judgment of 20 September 1994, Series A no. 295-A, pp. 17-18, paras. 47-48) where the Court had accepted that respect for the religious feelings of believers can move a State legitimately to restrict the publication of provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration.', '47. The Commission considered that the English law of blasphemy is intended to suppress behaviour directed against objects of religious veneration that is likely to cause justified indignation amongst believing Christians. It follows that the application of this law in the present case was intended to protect the right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings.', '48. The Court notes at the outset that, as stated by the Board, the aim of the interference was to protect against the treatment of a religious subject in such a manner ""as to be calculated (that is, bound, not intended) to outrage those who have an understanding of, sympathy towards and support for the Christian story and ethic, because of the contemptuous, reviling, insulting, scurrilous or ludicrous tone, style and spirit in which the subject is presented"" (see paragraph 15 above). This is an aim which undoubtedly corresponds to that of the protection of ""the rights of others"" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2). It is also fully consonant with the aim of the protections afforded by Article 9 (art. 9) to religious freedom.', '49. Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the"" necessity"" of the interference.', '50. It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith. Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above). However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention. The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it (see, for example, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 18, para. 33). The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.', '51. The refusal to grant a certificate for the distribution of Visions of Ecstasy consequently had a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'C. Whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society""', '52. The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society. As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities. Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger- Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49).', '53. No restriction on freedom of expression, whether in the context of religious beliefs or in any other, can be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) unless it satisfies, inter alia, the test of necessity as required by the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2). In examining whether restrictions to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered ""necessary in a democratic society"" the Court has, however, consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and it will do so by assessing in the circumstances of a particular case, inter alia, whether the interference corresponded to a ""pressing social need"" and whether it was ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"" (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Goodwin judgment cited above at paragraph 40, pp. 500-01, para. 40).', '54. According to the applicant, there was no ""pressing social need"" to ban a video work on the uncertain assumption that it would breach the law of blasphemy; indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed. Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice. In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued.', '55. For the Commission, the fact that Visions of Ecstasy was a short video work and not a feature film meant that its distribution would have been more limited and less likely to attract publicity. The Commission came to the same conclusion as the applicant.', '56. The Government contended that the applicant ’ s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive. In those circumstances, in refusing to grant a classification certificate for the applicant ’ s video work, the national authorities only acted within their margin of appreciation.', '57. The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above). The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context. As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries. It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether. In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above). Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above). However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger- Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49).', '58. Whereas there is little scope under Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2) for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, para. 42; the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, para. 43; and the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, para. 63), a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of morals or, especially, religion. Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35). This does not of course exclude final European supervision. Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material. In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important. Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60).', '59. The Court ’ s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant ’ s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).', '60. As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion. Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit. As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control. The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness. The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness. It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.', '61. Visions of Ecstasy portrays, inter alia, a female character astride the recumbent body of the crucified Christ engaged in an act of an overtly sexual nature (see paragraph 9 above). The national authorities, using powers that are not themselves incompatible with the Convention (see paragraph 57 above), considered that the manner in which such imagery was treated placed the focus of the work ""less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience, which is the primary function of pornography"" (see paragraph 15 above). They further held that since no attempt was made in the film to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a ""voyeuristic erotic experience"", the public distribution of such a video could outrage and insult the feelings of believing Christians and constitute the criminal offence of blasphemy. This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings. Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above). Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State ’ s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2). Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive.', '62. It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger- Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46). The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution. Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above). Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.', '63. The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence. The use of a box including a warning as to the film ’ s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above. In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public.', '64. It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film ’ s distribution. However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above). Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.', 'D. Conclusion', '65. Against this background the national authorities were entitled to consider that the impugned measure was justified as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Art. 10-2). There has therefore been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Art. 10).']",2,gb,001-58080,0

The applicants are British citizens, resident in Manchester, England.', 'The first applicant, ""X"", was born in 1955 and works as a college lecturer. X is a female-to-male transsexual and will be referred to throughout this judgment using the male personal pronouns ""he"", ""him"" and ""his"".', 'Since 1979 he has lived in a permanent and stable union with the second applicant, ""Y"", a woman born in 1959. The third applicant, ""Z"", was born in 1992 to the second applicant as a result of artificial insemination by donor (""AID""). Y has subsequently given birth to a second child by the same method.', '13. X was born with a female body. However, from the age of four he felt himself to be a sexual misfit and was drawn to ""masculine"" roles of behaviour. This discrepancy caused him to suffer suicidal depression during adolescence.', 'In 1975, he started to take hormone treatment and to live and work as a man. In 1979, he began living with Y and later that year he underwent gender reassignment surgery, having been accepted for treatment after counselling and psychological testing.', '14. In 1990, X and Y applied through their general practitioner (""GP"") for AID. They were interviewed by a specialist in January 1991 with a view to obtaining treatment and their application was referred to a hospital ethics committee, supported by two references and a letter from their GP. It was, however, refused.', '15. They appealed, making representations which included reference to a research study in which it was reported that in a study of thirty-seven children raised by transsexual or homosexual parents or carers, there was no evidence of abnormal sexual orientation or any other adverse effect (R. Green, ""Sexual identity of 37 children raised by homosexual or transsexual parents"", American Journal of Psychiatry, 1978, vol. 135, pp. 692-97).', 'In November 1991, the hospital ethics committee agreed to provide treatment as requested by the applicants. They asked X to acknowledge himself to be the father of the child within the meaning of the Human Fertility and Embryology Act 1990 (see paragraph 21 below).', '16. On 30 January 1992, Y was impregnated through AID treatment with sperm from an anonymous donor. X was present throughout the process. Z was born on 13 October 1992.', '17. In February 1992, X had enquired of the Registrar General (see paragraph 22 below) whether there was an objection to his being registered as the father of Y ’ s child. In a reply dated 4 June 1992 to X ’ s Member of Parliament, the Minister of Health replied that, having taken legal advice, the Registrar General was of the view that only a biological man could be regarded as a father for the purposes of registration. It was pointed out that the child could lawfully bear X ’ s surname and, subject to the relevant conditions, X would be entitled to an additional personal tax allowance if he could show that he provided financial support to the child.', '18. Nonetheless, following Z ’ s birth, X and Y attempted to register the child in their joint names as mother and father. However, X was not permitted to be registered as the child ’ s father and that part of the register was left blank. Z was given X ’ s surname in the register (see paragraph 24 below).', '19. In November 1995, X ’ s existing job contract came to an end and he applied for approximately thirty posts. The only job offer which he received was from a university in Botswana. The conditions of service included accommodation and free education for the dependants of the employee. However, X decided not to accept the job when he was informed by a Botswanan official that only spouses and biological or adopted children would qualify as ""dependants"". He subsequently obtained another job in Manchester where he continues to work.']","['II. Relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. Definition of gender in domestic law', '20. English law defines a person ’ s sex by reference to biological criteria at birth and does not recognise that it can be changed by gender reassignment surgery (Corbett v. Corbett [1971] Probate Reports 83 and R. v. Tan [1983] Queen ’ s Bench Reports 1053 (Court of Appeal)).', 'As a result of this principle, a female-to-male transsexual is not permitted to marry a woman and cannot be regarded as the father of a child.', 'B. Children conceived by artificial insemination', '21. The Human Fertility and Embryology Act 1990 (""the 1990 Act"") provides, inter alia, that where an unmarried woman gives birth as a result of AID with the involvement of her male partner, the latter, rather than the donor of the sperm, shall be treated for legal purposes as the father of the child (section 28 (3)).', 'C. Registration of births', '22. Section 1 (1) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (""the 1953 Act"") requires that certain prescribed details concerning the birth of every child born in England and Wales, including the names of the parents, be entered in a register. The Registrar General is the official ultimately responsible for the administration of this scheme.', '23. If the child ’ s father (or the person regarded by law as the father - see paragraph 21 above) is not married to the mother, his name shall not automatically be entered on the register in the space provided for the father. However, it will be entered if he and the mother jointly request that this be done (section 10 of the 1953 Act, as amended by the Family Law Reform Act 1987).', '24. A birth certificate takes the form either of an authenticated copy of the entry in the register of births or an extract from it. A certificate of the latter kind, known as a ""short certificate of birth"", is in a prescribed form and contains such particulars as are prescribed by regulations made under the 1953 Act. These particulars are the name, surname, sex and date and place of birth of the individual concerned. Under English law, a child may be given any first name or surname as the parents see fit, and may change his or her name or surname at any time, without restriction.', 'D. Parental responsibility', '25. ""Parental responsibility"" in respect of a child automatically vests in the mother and, where she is married, in her husband. It may, additionally, be granted to certain other persons (see paragraphs 26-27 below).', '""Parental responsibility"" means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibility and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his or her property (section 3 of the Children Act 1989 - ""the 1989 Act"").', 'It does not, without more, confer on the child any rights in the property of the person granted parental responsibility, such as the right to inherit on intestacy or to financial support. Similarly, it does not entitle the child to benefit through that person from the transmission of tenancies pursuant to certain statutory provisions, from nationality and immigration measures or from rights accruing from that person ’ s citizenship in the European Union.', '26. The father of a child who was not married to the mother at the time of the birth may apply for a court order granting him parental responsibility or may attain it by virtue of an agreement, in a prescribed form, with the mother (section 4 of the 1989 Act).', '27. Parental responsibility cannot vest in any other person, unless a ""residence order"" in respect of the child is made in his or her favour.', 'A residence order is ""an order settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom the child is to live"" (section 8 of the 1989 Act). Any person may apply for such an order (although individuals outside certain defined categories must first seek the leave of the court in order to apply).', 'Where the court makes a residence order in respect of any person who is not the parent or guardian of the child, that person is automatically vested with parental responsibility for the child as long as the residence order remains in force (section 12 (2) of the 1989 Act).', '28. Thus, although the first applicant could not apply directly for parental responsibility of the third applicant, he could apply with the second applicant for a joint residence order which would have the effect of giving him parental responsibility while it remained in force. On 24 June 1994, Mr Justice Douglas-Brown in the Manchester High Court made a joint residence order in favour of two cohabiting lesbian women in respect of the child of one of them (unreported).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '29. In their application to the Commission of 6 May 1993 (no. 21830/93) as declared admissible, the applicants complained that, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), they were denied respect for their family and private life as a result of the lack of recognition of the first applicant ’ s role as father to the third applicant and that the resulting situation in which they were placed was discriminatory, in violation of Articles 8 and 14 taken together (art. 14+8).', '30. On 1 December 1994, the Commission declared admissible the complaints under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 14), and declared inadmissible complaints under Articles 12 and 13 (art. 12, art. 13). In its report of 27 June 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) (thirteen votes to five) and that it was not necessary to examine whether there had been a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 (art. 14+8) (seventeen votes to one). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the five separate opinions contained in the report are reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '31. At the hearing on 27 August 1996 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, asked the Court to hold that there had been no violation of Articles 8 or 14 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 14).', 'On the same occasion, the applicants requested the Court to reach a finding of violation and to award them just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50).', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION ( art. 8)', '32. The applicants, with whom the Commission agreed, submitted that the lack of legal recognition of the relationship between X and Z amounted to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', 'The Government denied that Article 8 (art. 8) was applicable and, in the alternative, claimed that there had been no violation.', 'A. The existence of ""family life""', '33. The applicants submitted that they had shared a ""family life"" within the meaning of Article 8 (art. 8) since Z ’ s birth. They emphasised that, according to the jurisprudence of the Commission and the Court, social reality, rather than formal legal status, was decisive. Thus, it was important to note that X had irrevocably changed many of his physical characteristics and provided financial and emotional support to Y and Z. To all appearances, the applicants lived as a traditional family.', '34. The Government did not accept that the concept of ""family life"" applied to the relationships between X and Y or X and Z. They reasoned that X and Y had to be treated as two women living together, because X was still regarded as female under domestic law and a complete change of sex was not medically possible. Case-law of the Commission indicated that a ""family"" could not be based on two unrelated persons of the same sex, including a lesbian couple (see the Commission ’ s decisions on admissibility in X and Y v. the United Kingdom, application no. 9369/81, Decisions and Reports 32, p. 220, and Kerkhoven and Others v. the Netherlands, application no. 15666/89). Nor could X be said to enjoy ""family life"" with Z since he was not related to the child by blood, marriage or adoption.', 'At the hearing before the Court, counsel for the Government accepted that if X and Y applied for and were granted a joint residence order in respect of Z (see paragraph 27 above), it would be difficult to maintain that there was no ""family life"" for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8).', '35. The Commission considered that the relationship between X and Y could not be equated with that of a lesbian couple, since X was living in society as a man, having undergone gender reassignment surgery. Aside from the fact that X was registered at birth as a woman and was therefore under a legal incapacity to marry Y or be registered as Z ’ s father, the applicants ’ situation was indistinguishable from the traditional notion of ""family life"".', '36. The Court recalls that the notion of ""family life"" in Article 8 (art. 8) is not confined solely to families based on marriage and may encompass other de facto relationships (see the Marckx v. Belgium judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 14, para. 31; the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 17, para. 44; and the Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 October 1994, Series A no. 297-C, pp. 55-56, para. 30). When deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to ""family life"", a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couple live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means (see, for example, the above-mentioned Kroon and Others judgment, loc. cit.).', '37. In the present case, the Court notes that X is a transsexual who has undergone gender reassignment surgery. He has lived with Y, to all appearances as her male partner, since 1979. The couple applied jointly for, and were granted, treatment by AID to allow Y to have a child. X was involved throughout that process and has acted as Z ’ s ""father"" in every respect since the birth (see paragraphs 14-16 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that de facto family ties link the three applicants.', 'It follows that Article 8 is applicable (art. 8).', 'B. Compliance with Article 8 (art. 8)', '1. The arguments as to the applicable general principles', '38. The applicants pointed out that the Court had recognised in its Rees v. the United Kingdom judgment (17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, p. 19, para. 47), that the need for appropriate legal measures affecting transsexuals should be kept under review having regard in particular to scientific and societal developments. They maintained that there had been significant development since that decision: in particular, the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe had called for comprehensive recognition of transsexual identity (Resolution OJ 1989 C256 and Recommendation 1117 of 29 September 1989 respectively); the Court of Justice of the European Communities had decided that the dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to gender reassignment amounted to discrimination contrary to Community Directive 76/207 (P. v. S. and Cornwall County Council, C-13/94, 30 April 1996); and scientific research had been published which suggested that transsexuality was not merely a psychological disorder, but had a physiological basis in the structure of the brain (see, for example, ""Biological Aspects of Transsexualism"" by Professor L.J.G. Gooren, Council of Europe document no. CJ-DE/XXIII (93) 5, and Zhou, Hofman, Gooren and Swaab, ""A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality "", Nature, 2 November 1995, vol. 378, p. 68). These developments made it appropriate for the Court to re-examine the principles underlying its decisions in the above-mentioned Rees case and in Cossey v. the United Kingdom (27 September 1990, Series A no. 184), in so far as they had an impact on the present problem. The Court should now hold that the notion of respect for family and/or private life required States to recognise the present sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals for legal purposes, including parental rights.', 'However, they also emphasised that the issue in their case was very different from that in Rees and Cossey, since X was not seeking to amend his own birth certificate but rather to be named in Z ’ s birth certificate as her father. They submitted that the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State should be narrower in such a case and the need for positive action to ensure respect much stronger, having regard to the interests of the child in having her social father recognised as such by law.', '39. The Government contended that Contracting States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in relation to the complex issues raised by transsexuality, in view of the lack of a uniform approach to the problem and the transitional state of the law. They denied that there had been any significant change in the scientific or legal position with regard to transsexuals: despite recent research, there still remained uncertainty as to the essential nature of the condition and there was not yet any sufficiently broad consensus between the member States of the Council of Europe (see, for example, the Report of the Proceedings of the XXIIIrd Colloquy on European Law, Transsexualism, Medicine and the Law, Council of Europe, 1993, and S.M. Breedlove, ""Another Important Organ"", Nature, 2 November 1995, vol. 378, p. 15). The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in P. v. S. and Cornwall County Council (cited at paragraph 38 above) did not assist the applicants because it was not concerned with the extent to which a State was obliged to recognise a person ’ s change of sex for legal purposes.', 'Like the applicants, the Government stressed that the present case was not merely concerned with transsexuality. Since it also raised difficult and novel questions relating to the treatment of children born by AID, the State should enjoy a very broad margin of appreciation.', '40. The Commission referred to a clear trend within the Contracting States towards the legal recognition of gender reassignment. It took the view that, in the case of a transsexual who had undergone gender reassignment surgery in the Contracting State and who lived there as part of a family relationship, there had to be a presumption in favour of legal recognition of that relationship, the denial of which required special justification.', '2. The Court ’ s general approach', '41. The Court reiterates that, although the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities, there may in addition be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life. The boundaries between the State ’ s positive and negative obligations under this provision (art. 8) do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole, and in both cases the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, for example, the above-mentioned Rees judgment, p. 14, para. 35, and the above-mentioned Kroon and Others judgment, p. 56, para. 31).', '42. The present case is distinguishable from the previous cases concerning transsexuals which have been brought before the Court (see the above-mentioned Rees judgment, the above-mentioned Cossey judgment and the B. v. France judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 232-C), because here the applicants ’ complaint is not that the domestic law makes no provision for the recognition of the transsexual ’ s change of identity, but rather that it is not possible for such a person to be registered as the father of a child; indeed, it is for this reason that the Court is examining this case in relation to family, rather than private, life (see paragraph 37 above).', '43. It is true that the Court has held in the past that where the existence of a family tie with a child has been established, the State must act in a manner calculated to enable that tie to be developed and legal safeguards must be established that render possible, from the moment of birth or as soon as practicable thereafter, the child ’ s integration in his family (see for example the above-mentioned Marckx judgment, p. 15, para. 31; the Johnston and Others v. Ireland judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, p. 29, para. 72; the above-mentioned Keegan judgment, p. 19, para. 50; and the above-mentioned Kroon and Others judgment, p. 56, para. 32). However, hitherto in this context it has been called upon to consider only family ties existing between biological parents and their offspring. The present case raises different issues, since Z was conceived by AID and is not related, in the biological sense, to X, who is a transsexual.', '44. The Court observes that there is no common European standard with regard to the granting of parental rights to transsexuals. In addition, it has not been established before the Court that there exists any generally shared approach amongst the High Contracting Parties with regard to the manner in which the social relationship between a child conceived by AID and the person who performs the role of father should be reflected in law. Indeed, according to the information available to the Court, although the technology of medically assisted procreation has been available in Europe for several decades, many of the issues to which it gives rise, particularly with regard to the question of filiation, remain the subject of debate. For example, there is no consensus amongst the member States of the Council of Europe on the question whether the interests of a child conceived in such a way are best served by preserving the anonymity of the donor of the sperm or whether the child should have the right to know the donor ’ s identity.', 'Since the issues in the case, therefore, touch on areas where there is little common ground amongst the member States of the Council of Europe and, generally speaking, the law appears to be in a transitional stage, the respondent State must be afforded a wide margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, the above mentioned Rees judgment, p. 15, para. 37, and the above-mentioned Cossey judgment, p. 16, para. 40).', '3. Whether a fair balance was struck in the instant case', '45. The applicants, with whom the Commission agreed, argued that a number of consequences flowed from the lack of legal recognition of X ’ s role as father. Perhaps most importantly, the child ’ s sense of security within the family might be undermined. Furthermore, the absence of X ’ s name on her birth certificate might cause distress on those occasions when a full-length certificate had to be produced, for example on registration with a doctor or school, if an insurance policy was taken out on her life or when she applied for a passport. Although Z was a British citizen by birth and could trace connection through her mother in immigration and nationality matters, problems could still arise if X sought to work abroad. For example, he had already had to turn down an offer of employment in Botswana because he had been informed that Y and Z would not have been recognised as his ""dependants"" and would not, therefore, have been entitled to receive certain benefits (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, in contrast to the position where a parent-child relationship was recognised by law, Z could not inherit from X on intestacy or succeed to certain tenancies on X ’ s death. The possibility of X obtaining a residence order in respect of Z (see paragraph 27 above) did not satisfy the requirement of respect, since this would entail the incurring of legal expense and an investigation by a court welfare officer which might distress the child.', 'In their submission, it was apparent that the legal recognition sought would not interfere with the rights of others or require any fundamental reorganisation of the United Kingdom system of registration of births, since the Human Fertility and Embryology Act 1990 allowed a man who was not a transsexual to be registered as the father of a child born to his female partner by AID (see paragraph 21 above).', '46. The Government pointed out that the applicants were not restrained in any way from living together as a ""family"" and they asserted that the concerns expressed by them were highly theoretical. Furthermore, X and Y could jointly apply for a residence order, conferring on them parental rights and duties in relation to Z (see paragraph 27 above).', '47. First, the Court observes that the community as a whole has an interest in maintaining a coherent system of family law which places the best interests of the child at the forefront. In this respect, the Court notes that, whilst it has not been suggested that the amendment to the law sought by the applicants would be harmful to the interests of Z or of children conceived by AID in general, it is not clear that it would necessarily be to the advantage of such children.', 'In these circumstances, the Court considers that the State may justifiably be cautious in changing the law, since it is possible that the amendment sought might have undesirable or unforeseen ramifications for children in Z ’ s position. Furthermore, such an amendment might have implications in other areas of family law. For example, the law might be open to criticism on the ground of inconsistency if a female-to-male transsexual were granted the possibility of becoming a ""father"" in law while still being treated for other legal purposes as female and capable of contracting marriage to a man.', '48. Against these general interests, the Court must weigh the disadvantages suffered by the applicants as a result of the refusal to recognise X in law as Z ’ s ""father"".', 'The applicants identify a number of legal consequences flowing from this lack of recognition (see paragraph 45 above). For example, they point to the fact that if X were to die intestate, Z would have no automatic right of inheritance. The Court notes, however, that the problem could be solved in practice if X were to make a will. No evidence has been adduced to show that X is the beneficiary of any transmissible tenancies of the type referred to; similarly, since Z is a British citizen by birth and can trace connection through her mother in immigration and nationality matters, she will not be disadvantaged in this respect by the lack of a legal relationship with X.', 'The Court considers, therefore, that these legal consequences would be unlikely to cause undue hardship given the facts of the present case.', '49. In addition, the applicants claimed that Z might suffer various social or developmental difficulties. Thus, it was argued that she would be caused distress on those occasions when it was necessary to produce her birth certificate.', 'In relation to the absence of X ’ s name on the birth certificate, the Court notes, first, that unless X and Y choose to make such information public, neither the child nor any third party will know that this absence is a consequence of the fact that X was born female. It follows that the applicants are in a similar position to any other family where, for whatever reason, the person who performs the role of the child ’ s ""father"" is not registered as such. The Court does not find it established that any particular stigma still attaches to children or families in such circumstances.', 'Secondly, the Court recalls that in the United Kingdom a birth certificate is not in common use for administrative or identification purposes and that there are few occasions when it is necessary to produce a full length certificate (see paragraph 24 above).', '50. The applicants were also concerned, more generally, that Z ’ s sense of personal identity and security within her family would be affected by the lack of legal recognition of X as father.', 'In this respect, the Court notes that X is not prevented in any way from acting as Z ’ s father in the social sense. Thus, for example, he lives with her, providing emotional and financial support to her and Y, and he is free to describe himself to her and others as her ""father"" and to give her his surname (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, together with Y, he could apply for a joint residence order in respect of Z, which would automatically confer on them full parental responsibility for her in English law (see paragraph 27 above).', '51. It is impossible to predict the extent to which the absence of a legal connection between X and Z will affect the latter ’ s development. As previously mentioned, at the present time there is uncertainty with regard to how the interests of children in Z ’ s position can best be protected (see paragraph 44 above) and the Court should not adopt or impose any single viewpoint.', '52. In conclusion, given that transsexuality raises complex scientific, legal, moral and social issues, in respect of which there is no generally shared approach among the Contracting States, the Court is of the opinion that Article 8 (art. 8) cannot, in this context, be taken to imply an obligation for the respondent State formally to recognise as the father of a child a person who is not the biological father. That being so, the fact that the law of the United Kingdom does not allow special legal recognition of the relationship between X and Z does not amount to a failure to respect family life within the meaning of that provision (art. 8).', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 (art. 14+8)', '53. In addition, the applicants complained of discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention (art. 14), which provides:', '""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.""', '54. The applicants did not develop this complaint in their memorial, since they adopted the findings of the Commission (see paragraph 55 below). However, at the hearing before the Court, their counsel referred in particular to the fact that had X been born a man he could have been registered as Z ’ s father under the provisions of the Human Fertility and Embryology Act 1990 (see paragraph 21 above).', '55. The Government submitted that no separate issue arose in connection with Article 14 (art. 14). In view of its finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), the Commission did not find it necessary to examine this complaint.', '56. The Court considers that the complaint under Article 14 (art. 14) is tantamount to a restatement of the complaint under Article 8 (art. 8), and raises no separate issue. In view of its finding in respect of the latter provision (art. 8) (see paragraph 52 above), there is no need to examine the issue again in the context of Article 14 (art. 14).', 'Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider this complaint.']",2,gb,001-58032,0

The applicant, Ms Alison Halford, was born in 1940 and lives in the Wirral. From 1962 until her retirement in 1992 she worked in the police service.', 'A. Background to the alleged telephone interceptions', '9. In May 1983 Ms Halford was appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable with the Merseyside police. As such she became the most senior-ranking female police officer in the United Kingdom.', '10. On eight occasions during the following seven years, Ms Halford applied unsuccessfully to be appointed to the rank of Deputy Chief Constable, in response to vacancies arising within Merseyside and other police authorities. In order to be considered for promotion to this rank, Home Office approval was required. However, according to the applicant, this was consistently withheld on the recommendation of the Chief Constable of the Merseyside police, who objected to her commitment to equality of treatment between men and women.', '11. Following a further refusal to promote her in February 1990, Ms Halford commenced proceedings on 4 June 1990 in the Industrial Tribunal against, inter alia, the Chief Constable of Merseyside and the Home Secretary, claiming that she had been discriminated against on grounds of sex.', 'On 14 June 1990, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Merseyside Police Authority were designated a ""Special Committee"" to handle the issues arising from the discrimination case.', '12. Ms Halford alleges that certain members of the Merseyside Police Authority launched a ""campaign"" against her in response to her complaint to the Industrial Tribunal. This took the form, inter alia, of leaks to the press, interception of her telephone calls (see paragraph 16 below) and the decision to bring disciplinary proceedings against her.', '13. Thus, on 14 September 1990, the Special Committee referred to the Senior Officers ’ Disciplinary Committee a report written by the Chief Constable about an alleged incident of misconduct on the part of Ms Halford on 24 July 1990. The Disciplinary Committee resolved, on 20 September 1990, to hold a formal investigation and to refer the matter to the Police Complaints Authority and, on 8 February 1991, to press charges. Ms Halford was suspended from duty on full pay from 12 December 1990.', '14. She challenged the above decisions by way of judicial review in the High Court. The matter was adjourned by Mr Justice MacPherson in September 1991 in view of a possible settlement. However, the parties failed to reach agreement and the matter came back before him on 20 December 1991. He found that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Police Authority had acted ultra vires and, without imputing ill-motive to them, held that there had been an element of unfairness. He therefore quashed the relevant decisions.', '15. The hearing before the Industrial Tribunal took place in June 1992. On 14 July 1992 the proceedings were adjourned pending negotiation between the parties, which led to settlement of the case. Ms Halford was given an ex gratia payment of 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP) by the Chief Constable (the statutory maximum which the Industrial Tribunal could have awarded), together with GBP 5,000 towards her personal expenses by the Home Secretary. It was agreed that she would retire from the police force on medical grounds (arising out of an injury to her knee in 1 989). In addition, the Home Office agreed to implement various proposals put by the Equal Opportunities Commission, inter alia to update and review selection procedures for senior posts within the police force.', 'B. The alleged interceptions', '16. As Assistant Chief Constable, Ms Halford was provided with her own office and two telephones, one of which was for private use. These telephones were part of the Merseyside police internal telephone network, a telecommunications system outside the public network. No restrictions were placed on the use of these telephones and no guidance was given to her, save for an assurance which she sought and received from the Chief Constable shortly after she instituted the proceedings in the Industrial Tribunal that she had authorisation to attend to the case while on duty, including by telephone.', 'In addition, since she was frequently ""on call"", a substantial part of her home telephone costs were paid by the Merseyside police. Her home telephone consisted of a telephone apparatus connected, through the ""network termination point"", to the public telecommunications network.', '17. She alleges that calls made from her home and her office telephones were intercepted for the purposes of obtaining information to use against her in the discrimination proceedings. In support of these allegations she adduced various items of evidence before the Commission (see paragraph 21 of the Commission ’ s report). In addition, she informed the Court that she was told by an anonymous source on 16 April 1991 that, shortly before, the source had discovered the Merseyside police checking transcripts of conversations made on her home telephone.', 'For the purposes of the case before the Court, the Government accepted that the applicant had adduced sufficient material to establish a reasonable likelihood that calls made from her office telephones were intercepted. They did not, however, accept that she had adduced sufficient material to establish such a reasonable likelihood in relation to her home telephone.', '18. Ms Halford raised her concerns about the interception of her calls before the Industrial Tribunal on 17 June 1992. On 2 July 1992, in the course of the hearing, counsel for the Home Secretary expressed the opinion that it was not possible for her to adduce evidence about the alleged interceptions before the Industrial Tribunal because section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (""the 1985 Act"") expressly excluded the calling of evidence before any court or tribunal which tended to suggest that an offence under section 1 of the Act had been committed (see paragraph 25 below).', '19. On 6 December 1991 Ms Halford applied to the Interception of Communications Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") for an investigation under section 7 of the 1985 Act (see paragraphs 30-32 below). In a letter dated 21 February 1992, the Tribunal informed her that its investigation had satisfied it that there had been no contravention of sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act in her case (see paragraphs 26-29 below). In a letter dated 27 March 1992, the Tribunal confirmed that it could not specify whether any interception had in fact taken place (see paragraph 32 below).', '20. In a letter to Mr David Alton MP dated 4 August 1992, the Home Secretary explained that Ms Halford ’ s complaint regarding the interception of calls made from her office telephones ""[did] not fall within [his] responsibilities as Home Secretary nor within the terms of the [1985] Act"".']","['II. Relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. Public telecommunications systems', '1. The offence created by the Interception of Communications Act 1985', '21. The Interception of Communications Act 1985 came into force on 10 April 1986 following the Court ’ s judgment in Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, Series A no. 82). Its objective, as outlined in the Home Office White Paper which preceded it, was to provide a clear statutory framework within which the interception of communications on public systems would be authorised and controlled in a manner commanding public confidence (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom (February 1985) HMSO, Cmnd. 9438).', '22. A ""public"" telecommunications system is defined as a telecommunications system which is run pursuant to a licence granted under the Telecommunications Act 1984 (""the 1984 Act"") and which has been designated as such by the Secretary of State (section 10 (1) of the 1985 Act, by reference to section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act).', '23. By section 1 (1) of the 1985 Act, anyone who intentionally intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a public communications system is guilty of a criminal offence.', '24. Section 1 (2) and (3) provide four circumstances in which a person who intercepts communications in this way will not be guilty of the offence. The only one of these which is relevant to the present case is the interception of a communication pursuant to a warrant issued by the Secretary of State under section 2 of the Act (see paragraph 26 below).', '2. Exclusion of evidence', '25. Section 9 of the 1985 Act provides that no evidence shall be adduced by any party, in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, which tends to suggest either that an offence under section 1 of the 1985 Act has been committed by a public servant or that a warrant has been issued to such a person under section 2 of the 1985 Act.', '3. Warrants', '26. Sections 2 to 6 of the 1985 Act set out detailed rules for the issuing of warrants by the Secretary of State for the interception of communications and the disclosure of intercepted material. Thus, section 2 (2) of the 1985 Act provides:', '""The Secretary of State shall not issue a warrant ... unless he considers that the warrant is necessary –', '(a) in the interests of national security;', '(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime; or', '(c) for the purposes of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom .""', 'When considering whether it is necessary to issue a warrant, the Secretary of State must take into account whether the information which it is considered necessary to acquire could reasonably be acquired by other means (section 2 (2) of the 1985 Act).', '27. The warrant must specify the person who is authorised to do the interception, and give particulars of the communications to be intercepted, such as the premises from which the communications will be made and the names of the individuals concerned (sections 2 (1) and 3 of the 1985 Act).', '28. A warrant cannot be issued unless it is under the hand of the Secretary of State himself or, in an urgent case, under the hand of a senior official where the Secretary of State has expressly authorised the issue of the warrant. A warrant issued under the hand of the Secretary of State is valid for two months; one issued under the hand of an official is only valid for two working days. In defined circumstances, warrants may be modified or renewed (sections 4 and 5 of the 1985 Act).', '29. Section 6 of the Act provides, inter alia, for the limitation of the extent to which material obtained pursuant to a warrant may be disclosed, copied and retained.', '4. The Interception of Communications Tribunal', '30. The 1985 Act also provided for the establishment of an Interception of Communications Tribunal. The Tribunal consists of five members, each of whom must be a lawyer of not less than ten years ’ standing, who hold office for five years subject to reappointment (section 7 of and Schedule 1 to the 1985 Act).', '31. Any person who believes, inter alia, that communications made by or to him may have been intercepted in the course of their transmission by means of a public telecommunications system can apply to the Tribunal for an investigation. If the application does not appear to the Tribunal to be frivolous or vexatious, it is under a duty to determine whether a warrant has been issued, and if so, whether it was issued in accordance with the 1985 Act. In making this determination, the Tribunal applies ""the principles applicable by a court on application for judicial review"" (section 7 (2)-(4) of the 1985 Act).', '32. If the Tribunal determines that there has been no breach of the 1985 Act, it will inform the complainant, but it will not confirm whether there was no breach because there was no authorised interception or because, although there was such an interception, it was justified under the terms of the 1985 Act. In cases where the Tribunal finds there has been a breach, it has a duty to make a report of its findings to the Prime Minister and a power to notify the complainant. It also has the power, inter alia, to order the quashing of the warrant and the payment of compensation to the complainant. The Tribunal does not give reasons for its decisions and there is no appeal from a decision of the Tribunal (section 7 (7)-(8) of the 1985 Act).', '5. The Commissioner', '33. The 1985 Act also makes provision for the appointment of a Commissioner by the Prime Minister. The first Commissioner was Lord Justice Lloyd (now Lord Lloyd), succeeded in 1992 by Lord Bingham, also a senior member of the judiciary, who was in turn succeeded in 1994 by another, Lord Nolan.', '34. The Commissioner ’ s functions include reviewing the carrying out by the Secretary of State of the functions conferred on him by sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act, reporting to the Prime Minister breaches of sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act which have not been reported by the Tribunal and making an annual report to the Prime Minister on the exercise of his functions. This report must be laid before Parliament, although the Prime Minister has the power to exclude any matter from it the publication of which would be prejudicial to national security, to the prevention or detection of serious crime or to the well-being of the United Kingdom. The report must state if any matter has been excluded (section 8 of the 1985 Act).', '35. In general,the reports of the Commissioner to the Prime Minister have indicated an increase in new warrants issued, but the Commissioner has been satisfied that in all cases those new warrants were justified under section 2 of the 1985 Act.', 'B. Telecommunications systems outside the public network', '36. The 1985 Act does not apply to telecommunications systems outside the public network, such as the internal system at Merseyside police headquarters, and there is no other legislation to regulate the interception of communications on such systems.', '37. The English common law provides no remedy against interception of communications, since it ""places no general constraints upon invasions of privacy as such"" (Mr Justice Sedley in R. v. Broadcasting Complaints Commission, ex parte Barclay, 4 October 1996, unreported).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '38. In her application of 22 April 1992 (no. 20605/92) to the Commission, Ms Halford complained that the interception of calls made from her office and home telephones amounted to unjustifiable interferences with her rights to respect for her private life and freedom of expression, contrary to Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 10), that she had no effective domestic remedy in relation to the interceptions, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13), and that she was discriminated against on grounds of sex, contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Articles 8 and 10 (art. 14+8, art. 14+10).', '39. The Commission declared the application admissible on 2 March 1995. In its report of 18 April 1996 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by twenty-six votes to one, that there had been violations of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 13) in relation to Ms Halford ’ s office telephones and, unanimously, that there had been no violation of Articles 8, 10 or 13 (art. 8, art. 10, art. 13) in relation to her home telephone, that it was not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 (art. 10) in relation to her office telephones, and that there had been no violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Articles 8 or 10 (art. 14+8, art. 14+10). The full text of the Commission ’ s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '40. At the hearing, as they had done in their memorial, the Government asked the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the Convention.', 'The applicant maintained that there had been a violation, and asked the Court to award her compensation under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 8)', '41. Ms Halford alleged that the interception of her telephone calls amounted to violations of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""', 'The Commission agreed that there had been a violation so far as the interception of calls from her office telephones was concerned. The Government denied that there had been any violation.', 'A. The office telephones', '1. Applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) to the complaint relating to the office telephones', '42. The applicant argued, and the Commission agreed, that the calls made on the telephones in Ms Halford ’ s office at Merseyside police headquarters fell within the scope of ""private life"" and ""correspondence"" in Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), since the Court in its case-law had adopted a broad construction of these expressions (see, for example, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 21, para. 41; the Huvig v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176 ‑ B, p. 41, para. 8, and p. 52, para. 25; the Niemietz v. Germany judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251-B; and the A. v. France judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-B).', '43. The Government submitted that telephone calls made by Ms Halford from her workplace fell outside the protection of Article 8 (art. 8), because she could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to them. At the hearing before the Court, counsel for the Government expressed the view that an employer should in principle, without the prior knowledge of the employee, be able to monitor calls made by the latter on telephones provided by the employer.', '44. In the Court ’ s view, it is clear from its case-law that telephone calls made from business premises as well as from the home may be covered by the notions of ""private life"" and ""correspondence"" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1) (see the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, loc. cit.; the Malone v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 30, para. 64; the above-mentioned Huvig judgment, loc. cit.; and, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Niemietz judgment, pp. 33-35, paras. 29-33).', '45. There is no evidence of any warning having been given to Ms Halford, as a user of the internal telecommunications system operated at the Merseyside police headquarters, that calls made on that system would be liable to interception. She would, the Court considers, have had a reasonable expectation of privacy for such calls, which expectation was moreover reinforced by a number of factors. As Assistant Chief Constable she had sole use of her office where there were two telephones, one of which was specifically designated for her private use. Furthermore, she had been given the assurance, in response to a memorandum, that she could use her office telephones for the purposes of her sex-discrimination case (see paragraph 16 above).', '46. For all of the above reasons, the Court concludes that the conversations held by Ms Halford on her office telephones fell within the scope of the notions of ""private life"" and ""correspondence"" and that Article 8 (art. 8) is therefore applicable to this part of the complaint.', '2. Existence of an interference', '47. The Government conceded that the applicant had adduced sufficient material to establish a reasonable likelihood that calls made from her office telephones had been intercepted. The Commission also considered that an examination of the application revealed such a reasonable likelihood.', '48. The Court agrees. The evidence justifies the conclusion that there was a reasonable likelihood that calls made by Ms Halford from her office were intercepted by the Merseyside police with the primary aim of gathering material to assist in the defence of the sex-discrimination proceedings brought against them (see paragraph 17 above). This interception constituted an ""interference by a public authority"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2), with the exercise of Ms Halford ’ s right to respect for her private life and correspondence.', '3. Whether the interference was ""in accordance with the law""', '49. Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) further provides that any interference by a public authority with an individual ’ s right to respect for private life and correspondence must be ""in accordance with the law"".', 'According to the Court ’ s well-established case-law, this expression does not only necessitate compliance with domestic law, but also relates to the quality of that law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law. In the context of secret measures of surveillance or interception of communications by public authorities, because of the lack of public scrutiny and the risk of misuse of power, the domestic law must provide some protection to the individual against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights (art. 8). Thus, the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in and conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such secret measures (see the above-mentioned Malone judgment, p. 32, para. 67; and, mutatis mutandis, the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 23, paras. 50-51).', '50. In the present case, the Government accepted that if, contrary to their submission, the Court were to conclude that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 (art. 8) in relation to her office telephones, such interference was not ""in accordance with the law"" since domestic law did not provide any regulation of interceptions of calls made on telecommunications systems outside the public network.', '51. The Court notes that the 1985 Act does not apply to internal communications systems operated by public authorities, such as that at Merseyside police headquarters, and that there is no other provision in domestic law to regulate interceptions of telephone calls made on such systems (see paragraphs 36-37 above). It cannot therefore be said that the interference was ""in accordance with the law"" for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 8-2), since the domestic law did not provide adequate protection to Ms Halford against interferences by the police with her right to respect for her private life and correspondence.', 'It follows that there has been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) in relation to the interception of calls made on Ms Halford ’ s office telephones.', 'B. The home telephone', '1. Applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) to the complaint relating to the home telephone', '52. It is clear from the Court ’ s case-law (see the citations at paragraph 44 above) that telephone conversations made from the home are covered by the notions of ""private life"" and ""correspondence"" under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). Indeed, this was not disputed by the Government.', 'Article 8 (art. 8) is, therefore, applicable to this part of Ms Halford ’ s complaint.', '2. Existence of an interference', '53. The applicant alleged that calls made from her telephone at home also were intercepted by the Merseyside police for the purposes of defending the sex discrimination proceedings. She referred to the evidence of interception which she had adduced before the Commission, and to the further specification made to the Court (see paragraph 17 above). In addition she submitted that, contrary to the Commission ’ s approach, she should not be required to establish that there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" that calls made on her home telephone were intercepted. Such a requirement would be inconsistent with the Court ’ s pronouncement in the above-mentioned Klass and Others case that the menace of surveillance could in itself constitute an interference with Article 8 rights (art. 8). In the alternative, she contended that if the Court did require her to show some indication that she had been affected, the evidence brought by her was satisfactory; given the secrecy of the alleged measures it would undermine the effectiveness of the protection afforded by the Convention if the threshold of proof were set too high.', '54. The Government explained that they could not disclose whether or not there had been any interception of calls made from the telephone in Ms Halford ’ s home, since the finding which the Interception of Communications Tribunal was empowered to make under the 1985 Act was deliberately required to be couched in terms which did not reveal whether there had been an interception on a public telecommunications system properly authorised under the Act or whether there had in fact been no interception. They could, however, confirm that the Tribunal was satisfied that there had been no contravention of sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act in Ms Halford ’ s case (see paragraphs 19 and 32 above).', '55. The Commission, applying its case-law, required the applicant to establish that there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" that calls made on her home telephone had been intercepted (see, for example, the report of the Commission on application no. 12175/86, Hewitt and Harman v. the United Kingdom, 9 May 1989, Decisions and Reports 67, pp. 98-99, paras. 29-32). Having reviewed all the evidence, it did not find such a likelihood established.', '56. The Court recalls that in the above-mentioned Klass and Others case it was called upon to decide, inter alia, whether legislation which empowered the authorities secretly to monitor the correspondence and telephone conversations of the applicants, who were unable to establish whether such measures had in fact been applied to them, amounted to an interference with their Article 8 rights (art. 8). The Court held in that case that ""in the mere existence of the legislation itself there is involved, for all those to whom the legislation could be applied, a menace of surveillance; this menace necessarily strikes at freedom of communication between users of the postal and telecommunication services and thereby constitutes an ‘ interference by a public authority ’ with the exercise of the applicants ’ right to respect for private and family life and for correspondence"" (p. 21, para. 41).', 'The Court further recalls that in its above-mentioned Malone judgment, in addition to finding that one telephone conversation to which the applicant had been a party had been intercepted at the request of the police under a warrant issued by the Home Secretary, it observed that ""the existence in England and Wales of laws and practices which permit and establish a system for effecting secret surveillance of communications amounted in itself to an ‘ interference ’"" (pp. 30-31, para. 64).', '57. However, the essence of Ms Halford ’ s complaint, unlike that of the applicants in the Klass and Others case (cited above, p. 20, para. 38), was not that her Article 8 rights (art. 8) were menaced by the very existence of admitted law and practice permitting secret surveillance, but instead that measures of surveillance were actually applied to her. Furthermore, she alleged that the Merseyside police intercepted her calls unlawfully, for a purpose unauthorised by the 1985 Act (see paragraphs 26 and 53 above).', 'In these circumstances, since the applicant ’ s complaint concerns specific measures of telephone interception which fell outside the law, the Court must be satisfied that there was a reasonable likelihood that some such measure was applied to her.', '58. In this respect the Court notes, first, that the Commission, which under the Convention system is the organ primarily charged with the establishment and verification of the facts (see, for example, the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2272, para. 38), considered that the evidence presented to it did not indicate a reasonable likelihood that calls made on the applicant ’ s home telephone were being intercepted (see the report of the Commission, paragraph 65).', '59. The Court observes that the only item of evidence which tends to suggest that calls made from Ms Halford ’ s home telephone, in addition to those made from her office, were being intercepted, is the information concerning the discovery of the Merseyside police checking transcripts of conversations. Before the Court, the applicant provided more specific details regarding this discovery, namely that it was made on a date after she had been suspended from duty (see paragraph 17 above). However, the Court notes that this information might be unreliable since its source has not been named. Furthermore, even if it is assumed to be true, the fact that the police were discovered checking transcripts of the applicant ’ s telephone conversations on a date after she had been suspended does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that these were transcripts of conversations made from her home.', '60. The Court, having considered all the evidence, does not find it established that there was an interference with Ms Halford ’ s rights to respect for her private life and correspondence in relation to her home telephone.', 'In view of this conclusion, the Court does not find a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) with regard to telephone calls made from Ms Halford ’ s home.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 13)', '61. Ms Halford further alleged that she had been denied an effective domestic remedy for her complaints, in violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13), which states:', '""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.""', 'A. The office telephones', '62. The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, contended that there had been a violation of Article 13 (art. 13) in view of the fact that there was no avenue in domestic law by which to complain about interceptions of calls made on telecommunications systems outside the public network.', '63. The Government submitted that Article 13 (art. 13) was not applicable in that Ms Halford had not made out an ""arguable claim"" to a violation of Articles 8 or 10 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 10). In the alternative, they submitted that no separate issue arose under this provision (art. 13) in relation to the office telephones.', '64. The Court recalls that the effect of Article 13 (art. 13) is to require the provision of a remedy at national level allowing the competent domestic authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (art. 13) (see the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 19 96-V, pp. 1869-70, para. 145). However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as ""arguable"" in terms of the Convention.', '65. The Court observes that Ms Halford undoubtedly had an ""arguable"" claim that calls made from her office telephones were intercepted and that this amounted to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) (see paragraphs 42-51 above). She was, therefore, entitled to an effective domestic remedy within the meaning of Article 13 (art. 13). However, as the Government have conceded in relation to Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) (see paragraph 50 above), there was no provision in domestic law to regulate interceptions of telephone calls made on internal communications systems operated by public authorities, such as the Merseyside police. The applicant was therefore unable to seek relief at national level in relation to her complaint concerning her office telephones.', 'It follows that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) in relation to the applicant ’ s office telephones.', 'B. The home telephone', '66. The applicant also complained that there was no remedy available to her against an interception of telephone calls made from her home by the police acting without a warrant. She referred to the first report of the Commissioner appointed under the 1985 Act (see paragraphs 33-34 above) who observed that he ""was not concerned with [the offence of unlawful interception created by the 1985 Act. He could] not in the nature of things know, nor could he well find out, whether there [had] been an unlawful interception ... That is a job for the police"" (Interception of Communications Act 1985, Report of the Commissioner for 1986, Cm 108, p. 2, para. 3).', '67. The Government submitted that Ms Halford had not established an arguable claim of a violation of the Convention in relation to the interception of calls made from her home. In the alternative, they submitted that the aggregate of remedies available to her, including those provided by the 1985 Act (see paragraph 31 above), was sufficient to satisfy Article 13 (art. 13).', '68. The Commission, in view of its conclusion as to the lack of a reasonable likelihood of interception of her home telephone calls, considered that she did not have an arguable claim warranting a remedy under Article 13 (art. 13).', '69. The Court recalls its observation that, in order to find an ""interference"" within the meaning of Article 8 (art. 8) in relation to Ms Halford ’ s home telephone, it must be satisfied that there was a reasonable likelihood of some measure of surveillance having been applied to the applicant (see paragraph 57 above). It refers in addition to its assessment of the evidence adduced by the applicant in support of her claim that calls made from her home telephone were intercepted (see paragraphs 58-60 above).', '70. The Court considers that this evidence is not sufficient to found an ""arguable"" claim within the meaning of Article 13 (art. 13) (see paragraph 64 above).', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) in relation to the applicant ’ s complaint concerning her home telephone.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 10 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 10, art. 14)', '71. In her application to the Commission, Ms Halford had complained that the interception of calls made from both her home and office telephones amounted to violations of Articles 10 and 14 of the Convention (art. 10, art. 14). However, before the Court she accepted that it might not be necessary to examine, in relation to these provisions (art. 10, art. 14), matters which had already been considered under Article 8 (art. 8).', 'Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) states (as far as relevant):', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', 'Article 14 (art. 14) states:', '""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.""', '72. The Court considers that the allegations in relation to Articles 10 and 14 (art. 10, art. 14) are tantamount to restatements of the complaints under Article 8 (art. 8). It does not therefore find it necessary to examine them separately.', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)', '73. Ms Halford asked the Court to grant her just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50), which provides as follows:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '74. Ms Halford claimed compensation for the intrusion into her privacy and the distress it had caused. She informed the Court that in 1992 she had required medical treatment for stress.', '75. The Government commented that no causal connection had been established between the stress suffered by the applicant at the time of proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal and the interception of her telephone calls.', '76. The Court, bearing in mind that the interception of calls made by Ms Halford on her office telephones at Merseyside police headquarters, not subject to any regulation by domestic law, appears to have been carried out by the police with the primary purpose of gathering material to be used against her in sex-discrimination proceedings, considers what occurred to have amounted to a serious infringement of her rights by those concerned. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that the stress Ms Halford suffered was directly attributable to the interception of her calls, rather than to her other conflicts with the Merseyside police.', 'Having taken these matters into account, the Court considers that GBP 10,000 is a just and equitable amount of compensation.', 'B. Pecuniary damage', '77. Ms Halford requested reimbursement of her personal expenses incurred in bringing the Strasbourg proceedings, estimated at between GBP 1,000 and GBP 1,250.', '78. The Government accepted that a sum could properly be awarded to cover her costs in attending the hearing before the Court. However, they observed that she had not produced any evidence to substantiate any other expenses.', '79. In view of the fact that no evidence was produced to substantiate Ms Halford ’ s expenses but that she clearly attended the hearing in Strasbourg, the Court decides to award GBP 600 in respect of this item.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '80. The applicant also claimed the costs and expenses of instructing solicitors and counsel. Her solicitors asked for payment at the rate of GBP 239 per hour. They estimated that they had undertaken the equivalent of 500 hours ’ work in connection with the Strasbourg proceedings and asked for GBP 119,500 (exclusive of value-added tax, ""VAT"") in respect of this. In addition, they asked for GBP 7,500 (exclusive of VAT) in respect of disbursements and expenses. Counsel ’ s fees were GBP 14,875 plus expenses of GBP 1,000 (exclusive of VAT).', '81. The Government considered that the hourly rate requested by Ms Halford ’ s solicitors was too high: in domestic proceedings the appropriate rate would be GBP 120-150 per hour. Furthermore, they submitted that it had not been necessary to work for 500 hours on the case. By way of illustration, they observed that, although the case involved only a narrow range of issues, the applicant ’ s solicitor had chosen to submit written pleadings of approximately 200 pages, with some 500 pages of annexes and appendices, containing for the most part information which was either irrelevant or of only peripheral relevance. They submitted that a total figure for legal costs of approximately GBP 25,000 would be entirely sufficient.', '82. Bearing in mind the nature of the issues raised by the case, the Court is not satisfied that the amounts claimed by the applicant were necessarily incurred or reasonable as to quantum (see, for example, the Saunders v. the United Kingdom judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2070, para. 93). Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards GBP 25,000 under this head, together with any VAT which may be chargeable.', 'D. Default interest', '83. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.']",3,gb,001-58039,0

Mr Oberschlick, a journalist living in Vienna, was at the material time editor of the periodical Forum.', '8. On 7 October 1990 on the occasion of a ""peace celebration"" (Friedensfeier) at the foot of the Ulrichsberg, Mr Haider, leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs - FPÖ) and Governor (Landeshauptmann) of the Land of Carinthia, gave a speech glorifying the role of the ""generation of soldiers"" who had taken part in the Second World War. In it he said that all soldiers, including those in the German army, had fought for peace and freedom and that people should therefore not differentiate between ""good"" and ""bad"" soldiers of that generation but should rather be grateful to all of them for having founded and built today’s affluent, democratic society. Mr Haider then criticised an Austrian writer who had, in his view, disparaged all those killed in the Second World War, and continued as follows:', '""Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of opinion is taken for granted in a democracy, but it reaches its limits where people lay claim to that spiritual freedom they would never have got if others had not risked their lives for them so that they may now live in democracy and freedom.""', '9. This speech was reproduced in full in Forum and commented on by the applicant and the aforementioned Austrian writer. Mr Oberschlick’s passage, entitled ""P.S.: ‘Trottel’ statt ‘Nazi’"" (""P.S.: `Idiot’ instead of `Nazi’""), read as follows:', '""I will say of Jörg Haider, firstly, that he is not a Nazi and, secondly, that he is, however, an idiot. That I justify as follows: [L.] [...] wholly convinced me that being called a Nazi is an advantage to Jörg Haider. That is why I ask my friends to forgive my abstaining from using that description for that very good reason.', '...', 'As [Haider] denies those of us who in his eyes did not have the legitimising good fortune [legitimierende Glück] to have risked our lives in the uniform of honour [Ehrenkleid] of the Third Reich for the Hitlerian freedom to wage wars of conquest [Raubkrieg] and impose the final solution, [and as he denies us] the right ‘to lay claim to a purely ""spiritual"" freedom of opinion’, let alone a ""political freedom"", and he himself has never had the good fortune to serve in the uniform of honour of the SS or the German army [Wehrmacht], thus excluding himself along with the vast majority of Austrians from any exercise of freedom, he is, in my eyes, an idiot.""', '10. On 26 April 1991 Mr Haider brought an action for defamation (üble Nachrede) and insult (Beleidigung) against the applicant in the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen - ""the Regional Court""). He also applied for an order for the immediate seizure of the relevant issue of the periodical and for an announcement of the institution of proceedings to be published in Forum.', '11. On 30 April 1991 the court allowed the application for an announcement to be published, but on 21 May 1991 Mr Oberschlick appealed against that decision.', '12. On 23 May 1991 the court found the applicant guilty under Article 115 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below) of having insulted Mr Haider and sentenced him to pay twenty day-fines of 200 Austrian schillings (ATS), with ten days’ imprisonment in default. In the court’s view, the word Trottel was an insult (Schimpfwort) and could only ever be used as a disparagement (Herabsetzung); it therefore could never be used for any objective criticism (sachliche Kritik). In the written version of the judgment the court ordered the seizure of the relevant issue of Forum.', '13. On 30 August 1991 the applicant lodged an appeal (Berufung) against that judgment. In his submission, the court had held that the expression in question constituted an insult to Mr Haider because it had disregarded the context in which it had been used. If the court had taken into account the whole of the article and its line of argument, it would have realised that the term complained of was justified since it served as a conclusion to the finding that Mr Haider had in his speech excluded himself from the enjoyment of freedom of opinion.', 'Mr Oberschlick also complained that the seizure of the relevant issue of Forum had not been ordered when judgment was given.', '14. On 16 September 1991 the applicant asked for the record of the hearing to be rectified and supplemented.', '15. On 18 October 1991 the Regional Court rectified part of the record and refused the further amendments sought by the applicant as irrelevant. On 10 December he lodged an appeal (Beschwerde) against that decision.', '16. In the meantime, on 5 December 1991, the Regional Court had rectified its judgment and removed from it the order for the seizure of Forum.', '17. On 18 March 1992 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the order to publish an announcement about the proceedings instituted by Mr Haider (see paragraph 11 above). On the same day the Court of Appeal declared inadmissible the appeal against the decision to rectify the record of the hearing (see paragraph 15 above).', '18. On 25 March 1992 the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s judgment but reduced the rate of the day-fine to ATS 50 (see paragraph 12 above).', 'It noted that the word in issue appeared in the title of the article. Only those who had read not just the lines written by the applicant but also Mr Haider’s speech and the comments accompanying it in Forum would understand that Mr Oberschlick had called the speaker an ""idiot"" as, in his view, he had in his speech excluded himself and the vast majority of Austrians from the enjoyment of freedom of opinion. Those who had not would link the term Trottel not with the conclusion that could be drawn from Mr Haider’s words but with his own person. It thus amounted to an insult that overstepped the limits of acceptable objective criticism (die Grenze sachlich zulässiger Kritik) and Mr Oberschlick must have been aware of that. At the most, he could have described the consequences of Mr Haider’s remarks as stupid (vertrottelt).', 'Admittedly, politicians who supported opinions that were open to criticism had to accept that they would be subject to especially hard-hitting attacks, even personal ones. The right to freedom of opinion must not, however, lead to insults replacing arguments of substance in political debate. The fact that a politician resorted to insults did not justify his detractors doing the same, unless personally provoked. Taking Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) as the basis for a right to insult someone would bring about a general debasement (generelle Verrohung) of political debate.']","['I. Relevant domestic law', '19. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:', 'Article 111', '""1. Anyone who, in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person, attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...', '2.

In his application (no. 20834/92) of 15 September 1992 to the Commission, Mr Oberschlick alleged that his conviction had been contrary to Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) and that the procedure adopted by the Austrian courts had been in breach of Article 6 (art. 6).', '21. On 6 April 1995 the Commission (First Chamber) declared the application admissible as to the complaints under Article 10 (art. 10) and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 29 November 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion by fourteen votes to one that there had been a violation of that provision (art. 10). The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '22. In their memorial the Government asked the Court to ""hold that there had been no violation of the rights Mr Oberschlick was relying on under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10)"".', '23. In his memorial the applicant asked the Court to ""hold that Austria had violated Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) [in] convicting him of a criminal offence"".', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 10)', '24. Mr Oberschlick argued that the decisions in which he was held to be guilty of insult had infringed his right to freedom of expression as secured in Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), which provides:', '""1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article (art. 10) shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""', '25. His conviction by the Vienna Regional Court on 23 May 1991 (see paragraph 12 above), upheld by the Vienna Court of Appeal on 25 March 1992 (see paragraph 18 above), had indisputably amounted to an ""interference"" with the exercise of freedom of expression.', 'Those appearing before the Court also agreed that the interference was ""prescribed by law"" - Article 115 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 above) - and its purpose was to protect ""the reputation or rights of others"", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).', 'The oral argument dealt with the question whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in order to achieve that end.', '26. In the applicant’s submission, the word Trottel (idiot) had not been used by chance; it was the only word that could both draw public attention to how outrageous the arguments in Mr Haider’s speech were and sum up the criticism of him in the article in issue. Both the words and the tone had been chosen to show Mr Haider and readers just how illogical, unreasonable and dangerous his words at the Ulrichsberg had been in that they were such as to deprive the speaker himself and most citizens of the right to freedom of opinion. That being so, it was in the public interest to warn people at large against the ideas of the person who was at that time Governor of the Land of Carinthia and was even regarded as a possible candidate for the position of Federal Chancellor. In sum, the word Trottel had been directed not against the speaker but against what he had said, as any average reader had been able to see.', '27. The Commission accepted that the word in issue could be considered insulting but was of the view that in the circumstances of the case and regard being had in particular to the views expressed by Mr Haider, the applicant’s conviction represented a disproportionate interference with the exercise of his freedom of expression.', '28. The Government pointed out that the conviction in question related not to Mr Oberschlick’s criticism of Mr Haider but merely to the use of the word Trottel. Far from being able to be regarded as the expression of an opinion, it was nothing but an insult used to denigrate and disparage an individual in public. That was not acceptable in a democratic society, even where the person being attacked had defended extreme opinions which were intended to provoke. In order to maintain a minimum level in political debate, certain basic rules had to be observed. Insults, denigrations and offensive language could not enjoy general, unlimited protection under the Convention as they made no positive contribution to the political development of society. They were more likely to poison the climate by prompting a desire for retaliation. In its own interests a democratic society could not tolerate such an escalation.', '29. The Court reiterates that, subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10-2), freedom of expression is applicable not only to ""information"" and ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb.', 'These principles are of particular importance with regard to the press. While it must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for ""the protection of the reputation of others"", its task is nevertheless to impart information and ideas on political issues and on other matters of general interest.', 'As to the limits of acceptable criticism, they are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual. A politician inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must display a greater degree of tolerance, especially when he himself makes public statements that are susceptible of criticism. He is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political issues, since exceptions to freedom of expression must be interpreted narrowly (see, in particular, the Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1) judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, pp. 25-26, paras. 57-59, and the Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi v. Austria judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, p. 17, para. 37).', '30. The Court notes that Mr Oberschlick was convicted for having insulted Mr Haider by describing him as a Trottel in the title and in the main body of the article he published in Forum. The Regional Court considered that the word itself was insulting and that its mere use was enough to justify the conviction (see paragraph 12 above). The Vienna Court of Appeal took the view that the mere fact that the word in question also appeared in the title of the article made it insulting since readers who had read neither the article nor Mr Haider’s speech and the comments on it would link the word not with what Mr Haider had said but with his own person (see paragraph 18 above).', '31. The Court disagrees. It wishes to point out in this connection that the judicial decisions challenged before it must be considered in the light of the case as a whole, including the applicant’s article and the circumstances in which it was written (see the Oberschlick (no. 1) judgment cited above, p. 26, para. 60).', 'The most important of these is Mr Haider’s speech, which Mr Oberschlick was reporting on in his article. In claiming, firstly, that all the soldiers who had served in the Second World War, whatever side they had been on, had fought for peace and freedom and had contributed to founding and building today’s democratic society and in suggesting, secondly, that only those who had risked their lives in that war were entitled to enjoy freedom of opinion, Mr Haider clearly intended to be provocative and consequently to arouse strong reactions.', '32. As to Mr Oberschlick’s article, it was published together with the speech in question and an article by a writer who was also reacting to what Mr Haider had said. In his article the applicant briefly explained, in some twenty lines, why Mr Haider’s remarks had prompted him to describe him as a Trottel rather than as a Nazi - mainly because in his speech Mr Haider had excluded himself from enjoying any freedom of opinion.', '33. In the Court’s view, the applicant’s article, and in particular the word Trottel, may certainly be considered polemical, but they did not on that account constitute a gratuitous personal attack as the author provided an objectively understandable explanation for them derived from Mr Haider’s speech, which was itself provocative. As such they were part of the political discussion provoked by Mr Haider’s speech and amount to an opinion, whose truth is not susceptible of proof. Such an opinion may, however, be excessive, in particular in the absence of any factual basis, but in the light of the above considerations that was not so in this instance (see, as the most recent authority, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 236, para. 47).', '34. It is true that calling a politician a Trottel in public may offend him. In the instant case, however, the word does not seem disproportionate to the indignation knowingly aroused by Mr Haider. As to the polemical tone of the article, which the Court should not be taken to approve, it must be remembered that Article 10 (art. 10) protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see among other authorities, the Oberschlick (no. 1) judgment cited above, p. 25, para. 57).', '35. In conclusion, the Court considers that the necessity of the interference with the exercise of the applicant’s freedom of expression has not been shown.', 'There has therefore been a breach of Article 10 (art. 10).', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)', '36. Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50) provides:', '""If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '37. Mr Oberschlick sought 23,394.80 Austrian schillings (ATS) in respect of pecuniary damage, that is to say reimbursement of the fine and of Mr Haider’s costs for court fees and legal representation, which the applicant was ordered to pay by the Vienna Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above).', '38. The Government agreed in the event of a finding that there had been a violation. The Delegate of the Commission made no observations.', '39. As payment by the applicant of the sums in question was a direct consequence of his wrongful conviction, the Court considers the claim justified.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '40. Mr Oberschlick sought ATS 194,998.84 in respect of the costs and expenses relating to his legal representation in the domestic courts and before the Convention institutions.', '41. The Government agreed to pay ATS 132,000 if a violation was found. The Delegate of the Commission made no observations.', '42. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant ATS 150,000 under this head.', 'C. Default interest', '43.

He was born in 1945 and lives in Vienna.', '7. At the material time the applicant was working for Profil, an Austrian periodical dealing mostly with politics. For several years, he investigated into and reported on the case of Mr Hannes Androsch, a former Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Finance, who was involved in certain criminal proceedings.', ""A. Mr Androsch's criminal record"", '8. In 1989 Mr Androsch had been convicted by the Vienna Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ) of having made false statements as a witness on two occasions. The court found that he had, before a parliamentary investigating committee ( Untersuchungsausschuß ), wrongly stated that certain amounts of money had been put at his disposal by a Mr S., whereas in fact they had been transferred from anonymous bank accounts operated by his wife and himself. Furthermore, in the context of criminal proceedings against financial officers charged with abuse of authority, Mr Androsch had stated that several anonymous accounts were held by a Mr S., whereas in fact they were operated by his wife, his mother and himself.', '9. In 1991 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court ( Landesgericht für Strafsachen ), sitting as a court of two professional judges and two lay judges ( Schöffengericht ), conducted criminal proceedings against Mr Androsch concerning charges of tax evasion. It held hearings, inter alia, on 25 and 26 May 1991.', 'On 8 October 1991 Mr Androsch was convicted of having evaded taxes between 1973 and 1981. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million Austrian schillings (ATS).', 'B. The article', '10. On 1 July 1991 Profil had published a two-page article written by the applicant, relating to the above proceedings. It read as follows:', '“ADJOURNED FOR REFLECTION', ""A criminal court sitting with lay judges spent two days considering Hannes Androsch's tax evasion. The atmosphere during the trial was glacial."", '‘Above all, there were to be no mistakes during the proceedings. The case was to be handled with common prudence, properly and to the best of our knowledge and belief – but not with kid gloves!’ (Mr Heinz Tschernutter, tax investigator and witness, when asked what principles had governed the hearing of the Androsch case.)', 'On the day before the trial [the Austrian newspaper] Die Presse dropped the bombshell that was meant to shake all Austria. Lawyer Herbert Schachter was quoted as saying: ‘I’m sure that Dr Androsch will present his case in an impressive manner.’', ""The horizon was darkened by this impressive presentation and the earth shook as the accused worsened his lousy position by taking refuge in lapses of memory (‘I can't remember’ – ‘I don't have any detailed knowledge’) and by attempting to shift the blame onto others (‘I was represented by tax advisers in all those years’) or by playing the animal that has been maltreated (‘There is not a single large-scale business in the whole of Austria that has been subjected for years to as many inspections as I have been’)."", ""Hannes Androsch's biggest problem is Hannes Androsch. His second biggest problem is his lawyer, Herbert Schachter. Together, defending counsel and client are invincible. If blatant scorn could change the temperature, the courtroom would be covered by a thick layer of ice."", ""The patient judge, Friedrich Zeilinger, enquires, ‘So, what exactly happened?’ The blasé defendant replies, ‘I would ask you to infer exactly what happened from the file. You have the documents in front of you – I haven't.’"", 'At another point Androsch said, with a disdainful gesture towards Friedrich Matousek: ‘You, my dear Public Prosecutor ...’ in a tone as if to say ‘You wretched worm!’', ""Androsch underestimates the judiciary. Once again. Judge Zeilinger knows the file inside out, as was clear from each of his questions. The public prosecutor, Matousek, is able to find his way around in the dark generated by the ‘international legal adviser's’ murky financial deals, and, after all, the prosecuting authorities have been examining the flow of funds to and from Hannes Androsch for a good decade."", ""The accused mistook the excessively polite and markedly accommodating manner of the presiding judge for weakness. He has also known the public prosecutor for years and yet still doesn't know him properly. Matousek speaks quietly and slowly so that one can follow what he says, and acts in a spectacularly unspectacular manner. Only the arrogant interpret his lack of grand gestures as cluelessness."", 'Even the public prosecutor did make one mistake, however, when he cited the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the proceedings against Androsch for giving false evidence (now concluded) and referred to ‘long-term, ingenious and sophisticated linking of accounts’. The alleged tax evasion was perhaps ‘long-term’ but by no means ‘ingenious and sophisticated’.', ""The opposite was true: anyone venturing into the maze of Androsch's accounts containing undeclared money is amazed by the structure's simplicity. It is not only wholly lacking in sophistication but is almost astoundingly crude. Crude not because Androsch lacked intelligence but rather because it was based on the cast-iron foundation of the misplaced loyalty of officials. While Androsch was Finance Minister, until January 1981, he could rely on the zealous but unlawful obedience of a number of powerful officials. As soon as Androsch left, those officials had their hands full concealing their complicity in the cover-up. Admittedly, a whole string of other officials, by no means excessively brave but simply law-abiding, attempted again and again to ensure that the law prevailed. They foundered, however, on practicalities. The team led by the Carinthian tax investigator, Adolf Panzenböck (1982 to 1984) certainly gathered all the relevant details, but the head of one of the Vienna tax offices who had been in charge of the case for only a day and a half issued a clean bill of health. And last week, when they appeared as witnesses, the tax officials Walter Handerek, Heinz Tschernutter and Gerhard Berner, who reopened the file between 1985 and 1988, were treated by defending counsel Herbert Schachter as though they were the accused rather than Androsch."", ""It has been known since 1980 that Androsch evaded taxes. The legal proceedings which were adjourned on Friday furnished further proof that for years the accused escaped prosecution thanks to the zealous obedience of officials. When this was no longer possible as an independent judge was in charge of the investigations, Androsch's advisers took every opportunity to delay the proceedings. It is both symptomatic and revealing that Androsch told the trial court again and again that ‘seven inspections’ had been carried out and on each occasion had found in his favour, and that it was very unfair that just the eighth inspection should shatter the ideal world of his illusory innocence. Everyone except him is to blame for this. Androsch has in the meantime become so completely immersed in the role of the innocent victim that he cannot subjectively conceive of ever having been the guilty party."", ""From an objective point of view, it should be pointed out in Androsch's favour that there may be several people in Austria who in nearly two decades (from 1965 to 1983) have evaded more than 6.3 million schillings in tax without, however, being subjected to such intensive publicity. On the other hand, no Austrian Finance Minister has simultaneously operated seven accounts containing undeclared funds. And, as the public prosecutor put it, although the origin of part of the money had been established, approximately five million schillings were left from unknown sources."", 'It was impious of Androsch to wheel out his ‘adoptive uncle’ again at the trial. Admittedly, he argued eloquently that the ‘adoptive uncle’ was actually an ‘adoptive father’, but nonetheless the name of a dead person had been taken in vain. Androsch alarmingly implicated not only his ‘adoptive father’ Gustav Steiner but also his father-in-law Paul Schärf in these financial proceedings. Both were induced to sacrifice themselves for Androsch and to assume a responsibility for undeclared funds and fiduciary relationships which they had never had. The investigating judge Anton Zelenka and subsequently the tax authorities and other judges (Josef Zehetmayer and later the Court of Appeal) proved long ago that Androsch was lying on this point. The flow of funds into and out of the seven accounts containing money not declared to the tax authorities allows of no other interpretation than that Androsch was evading taxes. His defence in court was disgraceful; after so many years one would at least have expected properly constructed arguments. Each time Judge Zeilinger asked him a specific question he either took refuge in lapses of memory or blamed his ‘adoptive father’. He even trotted out the late Sir Arthur Stein, the explorer of the Silk Road, from whom he claims to have received a legacy.', 'No new submissions were made in court – either as regards the accounts containing undeclared money or as regards the funding for his villas. Anyone who had expected Androsch to tell all and, as announced in the newspapers, to reveal new facts and adduce convincing arguments in his defence was bitterly disappointed. Only in respect of the charges of ‘covert distribution of profits’ was there any legal skirmishing.', 'Mr Schachter told the court that Androsch was a ‘victim of politics’. ‘Crimes had been attempted’ against Androsch and his client had always had ‘opponents who had gone as far as attempting to destroy Androsch psychologically and physically’.', 'Bruno Kreisky and others were to blame for this.', ""The court kept trying very gently to bring the defendant back down to earth from his long-winded waffling. And each time he replied ‘I can't say. After all, I do have other things to do’ (i.e. than grapple with such stupid questions)."", ""If necessary, the authorities can always be blamed for everything. In the instant case this cliché clearly did not apply to Judge Zeilinger. For two mornings he demonstrated drawing-room justice at its best. The judge forced himself to be polite even when he was clearly irritated by the defendant's bored self-assurance. On the very first day of the trial an area of psychological tension built up which the former Minister clearly misinterpreted. From time to time the 53-year-old slipped into the role of a public speaker talking politics. He paid less and less attention to the judge's questions and treated the public prosecutor with increasingly provocative contempt. He turned to look more and more often at the public in the gallery, seeking approval, and his gestures increasingly reminded one of the self-satisfied, powerful Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister accustomed to victory."", 'In those circumstances serious tactical errors were made. Defence counsel interrupted the judge and Androsch succumbed to his own charm. He talked and talked, a volubility that the Kronen Zeitung mistook for ‘brilliant rhetoric’. In reality the defendant was distancing himself as much as possible from his own responsibility.', 'Others were to blame.', 'Judge Zeilinger did not lose control of the situation for a second, however. From time to time, as was apparent from his posture, he had a sharp word on the tip of his tongue, but he never actually uttered it.', 'The defendant sensed weakness and made full use of his own – supposed – strength; he forged a link with the public while severing the one with the court.', 'Judge Zeilinger had prepared for this trial keenly and diligently. By citing facts he kept forcing Androsch into corners from which he could only escape by taking refuge in memory lapses.', ""In many major trials the sinner has been given a fair chance to the very end. Androsch too had a fair chance last Friday; of twelve defence motions, ten were dismissed and two allowed. The court admitted evidence as to whether in the tax proceedings against Androsch any unlawful influence had been exerted or instructions issued which adversely affected the taxpayer. In the next stage of trial, in August or September (the court even took account of defence counsel's summer holidays!), officials from the Regional Tax Office and the Ministry of Finance will therefore be heard as witnesses."", 'There comes, however, a point in every trial after which the court expects some sign of understanding. It hopes for a trace of humility that may be appraised as a mitigating circumstance.', 'The defendant has shown no humility to date, not even for a second. But he now has a few weeks to consider whether it is consonant with the principles of a State based on the rule of law for a Finance Minister and his family to have at their disposal accounts containing millions in undeclared funds.', 'It is now for him to display greatness. The judicial system has uncovered serious matters. The court nevertheless was guided wholly by the principles of fairness up to the very last moment of the trial last Friday, when it adjourned the proceedings.', 'For reflection.”', 'C. Proceedings in the Vienna Regional Criminal Court', '11. Mr Worm was charged under section 23 of the Media Act ( Mediengesetz – see paragraph 23 below) for having exercised prohibited influence on criminal proceedings ( verbotene Einflußnahme auf ein Strafverfahren ).', '12. On 12 May 1992 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, sitting with one judge ( Einzelrichter ), acquitted the applicant. It found that the text in issue was not capable of influencing the outcome of the proceedings against Mr Androsch and that it was not established that the applicant had acted with such an intention.', '13. The court recalled that in 1991 Mr Androsch had been convicted of tax evasion (see paragraph 9 above). In establishing whether the impugned article was capable of influencing the result of these proceedings, the court noted that the wording and content of the article as a whole, as well as the development of the proceedings reported upon, the person of the accused, and the person of the applicant had to be taken into account. The article, unlike court reports of the scandal press, analysed the conduct of the presiding judge, the public prosecutor, defence counsel and in particular the accused, Mr Androsch, almost as a psychologist would have done.', ""Furthermore, the court found that it was clear for every reader, who was vaguely familiar with the issue, that the applicant, who had been working for Profil for many years, had intensively dealt with the so-called “Causa Androsch” and had frequently reported on it. It appeared from the article that the applicant assumed that the investigations carried out by the tax authorities were correct. He subjected the statements made by the accused at the trial to a critical psychological analysis. However, his way of writing and the wording used were not capable of influencing these proceedings. Even to a lay judge, the applicant's person and his activities as a journalist in the Androsch case were well known. Thus he would not expect the applicant to give a neutral account of the proceedings."", 'Moreover, it had not been established that the applicant had acted with the intention of influencing the outcome of the proceedings, in particular as it appeared that he was convinced that Mr Androsch would in any event be convicted.', 'D. Proceedings in the Vienna Court of Appeal', ""14. On 19 October 1992 the Vienna Court of Appeal, sitting as a court of three professional judges on an appeal by the public prosecutor, held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and his counsel. Mr Worm was questioned and stated in particular that the first sentence of the incriminated passage, namely that “the flow of funds into and out of the seven accounts containing money not declared to the tax authorities allows of no other interpretation than that Androsch was evading taxes”, was a quotation from the public prosecutor's statement during the trial. The latter had also frequently made reference to Mr Androsch's conviction for having made false statements as a witness (see paragraph 8 above)."", ""15. At the end of the hearing, the operative provisions of the judgment as well as the relevant reasons were read out. The court convicted the applicant of having exercised prohibited influence on criminal proceedings and imposed on him forty day-fines of ATS 1,200 each, that is ATS 48,000, or twenty days' imprisonment in default of payment. The publishing firm was made jointly and severally liable for payment of the fine."", '16. The full text of the judgment was served on the applicant on 25 March 1993.', '17. The court held, inter alia :', '“The prosecution appeal is therefore well-founded. It rightly takes as its starting-point that the offence defined in section 23 of the Media Act must be classified as a potentially endangering offence [ abstraktes Gefährdungsdelikt ] …', 'In general, a potentially endangering offence is defined as conduct typically capable of bringing a dangerous situation into existence, even if in any given case no one is actually exposed to the danger concerned ...', ""The law regulates only the offender's conduct – in this case comment on the value of evidence – and links to it the inference that such comment is also capable of influencing the outcome of criminal proceedings. A potentially endangering offence accordingly amounts to conduct which is criminal irrespective of any result it may have [ schlichtes Tätigkeitsdelikt ] ..."", ""The considerations set out in the judgment at first instance as to the extent to which the comment on Mr Androsch's defence was capable of influencing the outcome of the criminal proceedings were therefore pointless ..."", ""The defendant's replies under examination in criminal proceedings constitute evidence ..."", '[The passage in issue] constitutes (unfavourable) comment on the value of the answers given by Mr Androsch, not just – as the court below held – a critical psychological analysis ...”', '18. It observed that “the objective element of the offence defined in section 23 of the Media Act is constituted not only by unfavourable comment on evidence but also by favourable comment”.', ""19. The Court of Appeal also contested the Regional Court's assumption that everybody, including the lay judges, knew the applicant's long-standing commitment in the Androsch case and would therefore not be influenced by his article. It was in no way certain that the lay judges regularly read Profil. On the contrary, in spectacular proceedings like the ones in issue, it happened frequently that lay judges would follow the reports in papers they did not usually read. There was no doubt that, at least with regard to the lay judges, the reading of the incriminated article was capable of influencing the outcome of the criminal proceedings."", '20. The court added:', '“[The above finding] is all the more true in the present case because it can be inferred from the article that the accused wished to usurp the position of the judges dealing with the case.', 'The objective element of the offence defined in section 23 of the Media Act is accordingly made out.', 'As regards the subjective element, it should be observed that it is hard to understand why the court below should have concluded that there was no intention to influence the outcome of the trial when that intention was, on the contrary, quite obvious.”', ""21. The court further found that the applicant's expertise and involvement in the subject matter rather reinforced the impression that he had written the article with the intention of influencing the outcome of the proceedings. He had researched into the case since 1978 and had written more than a hundred articles about it. From the beginning he had been convinced that Mr Androsch had committed tax evasion. In the article inissue he had not only criticised Mr Androsch's statement but had also anticipated the outcome of the proceedings, namely the conviction of the accused."", '22. The judgment ended as follows:', '“Even the quotation of the answer given by Mr Heinz Tschernutter placed at the top of the article – ‘Above all, there were to be no mistakes during the proceedings. The case was to be handled with common prudence, properly and to the best of our knowledge and belief – but not with kid gloves!’ – gives the average reader the impression that the court was being advised and urged to follow the same approach, in other words not to make any mistakes and not to handle Mr Androsch with kid gloves.”']","['II. Relevant domestic law', '23. Section 23 of the Media Act ( Mediengesetz ) is entitled “Prohibited influence on criminal proceedings” ( Verbotene Einflußnahme auf ein Strafverfahren ) and reads as follows:', '“Anyone who discusses, subsequent to the indictment ... [and] before the judgment at first instance in criminal proceedings, the probable outcome of those proceedings or the value of evidence in a way capable [ geeignet ] of influencing the outcome of the proceedings shall be punished by the court with up to 180 day-fines.”', '24. Article 77 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads:', '“(1) Judicial decisions are made public either by being read out in court or by service of the original or a certified copy thereof.', '(2) When read out, judgments must be put on record. Upon request, anyone concerned may receive a copy of the judgment.”', 'In practice, written copies of decisions such as the one at issue in the present case are automatically served on the persons concerned.', '25. Under Austrian criminal procedural law, the time allowed for appeals begins to run from the date when the written version of the decision appealed against has been served on the party concerned (Article 79 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '26. Mr Worm applied to the Commission on 28 July 1993. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention, complaining that his conviction under section 23 of the Media Act violated his right to freedom of expression.', ""27. The Commission declared the application (no. 22714/93) admissible on 25 November 1995. In its report of 23 May 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion by eighteen votes to eleven that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '28. In his memorial the applicant asked the Court to establish that there had been a violation of his right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention as a result of the incorrect interpretation by the Vienna Court of Appeal of section 23 of the Media Act.', ""29. The Government requested the Court to refuse to entertain the application for having been introduced later than six months after the final domestic decision was issued. Alternatively, the Court was asked to declare that the Vienna Court of Appeal's judgment of 19 October 1992 did not violate the applicant's rights under Article 10 of the Convention."", 'AS TO THE LAW', ""I. the GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION"", '30. By way of preliminary objection, the Government pleaded, as they had already done before the Commission, that Mr Worm had not complied with the rule, in Article 26 of the Convention, that applications to the Commission must be lodged “within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken”.', ""The Government observed that on 19 October 1992, at the end of the appellate hearing, the Vienna Court of Appeal gave its judgment in the applicant's case (see paragraph 15 above). Since a draft judgment was already available, not only the operative provisions but also all the relevant reasons were read out. The applicant and his counsel were both present. In those circumstances, the Government submitted that the six-month period should be deemed to have started to run from that date. This had moreover been the Commission's practice thus far."", ""In the Government's further submission, the fact that a written copy of the decision was not served on the applicant until 25 March 1993 (see paragraph 16 above) was irrelevant since this did not contain any more information than the judgment as delivered in open court."", ""31. The applicant contended that he had not been in a position to acquaint himself with the court's full reasoning concerning the public prosecutor's appeal until he received a written version of the judgment. In particular, where as in the present case complex legal issues are involved, an applicant cannot be expected to file an application with the Commission on the basis of an oral decision. The starting date for the six-month period should therefore be 25 March 1993, the date when the written version of the judgment was served."", '32. The Commission agreed with the applicant while acknowledging that the present case had led it to reconsider its previous approach. In its view, the six-month rule contained in Article 26 not only pursues the aim of ensuring legal certainty, it also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application with the Commission and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised. In that respect, the Commission found that when, in accordance with domestic law, the written text of a final decision has to be served on an applicant, the period of six months should be counted from the date of this service, irrespective of whether the judgment concerned, or part thereof, was previously delivered orally.', ""33. The Court notes that, under domestic law and practice (see paragraph 24 above), the applicant was entitled to be served ex officio a written copy of the Court of Appeal's judgment, and that the long delay for this service was exclusively the responsibility of the judicial authorities. The said judgment, which in its final version ran to over nine pages, contained detailed legal reasoning. In these circumstances, the Court shares the Commission's view (see paragraph 32 above) that the object and purpose of Article 26 are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment. Moreover, this is the solution adopted by Austrian law in respect of time-limits for lodging domestic appeals (see paragraph 25 above)."", ""34. The judgment of the Vienna Court of Appeal was served on the applicant on 25 March 1993 (see paragraph 16 above) and the application to the Commission was introduced less than six months thereafter, namely on 28 July 1993 (see paragraph 1 above). It follows that the Government's preliminary objection must be dismissed."", 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION', ""35. The applicant alleged that his conviction and the fine imposed upon him for having published an article commenting on Mr Androsch's trial constituted a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, which reads:"", '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', ""36. It was uncontested that the applicant's conviction constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 10 and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. It must therefore be examined whether the interference was justified under the second paragraph of that provision."", 'A. Whether the interference was “prescribed by law”', '37. It was common ground that convictions for “prohibited influence on criminal proceedings” have a legal basis in domestic law, namely section 23 of the Media Act (see paragraph 23 above).', 'The applicant maintained, however, that the facts in his case did not fall within the ambit of that provision and that the Vienna Court of Appeal had erred in its finding that his article was calculated to influence the criminal proceedings against Mr Androsch.', ""38. The Court reiterates that the relevant national law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned – if need be with appropriate legal advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic legislation (see, inter alia, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35–36, §§ 24 ‑ 25). In the present case, the Court is satisfied that the Vienna Court of Appeal's application of section 23 of the Media Act to the applicant's case did not go beyond what could be reasonably foreseen in the circumstances."", 'Accordingly, the Court concludes that the impugned conviction was “prescribed by law”.', 'B. Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim', ""39. In the present case it was not contested that the applicant's conviction was aimed at “maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary” and that it thus pursued a legitimate aim under the Convention."", '40. In this regard, the Court has consistently held that the expression “authority and impartiality of the judiciary” has to be understood “within the meaning of the Convention”. For this purpose, account must be taken of the central position occupied in this context by Article 6 which reflects the fundamental principle of the rule of law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 34, § 55).', ""The phrase “authority of the judiciary” includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person's guilt or innocence on a criminal charge; further, that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the courts' capacity to fulfil that function (ibid., mutatis mutandis )."", '“Impartiality” normally denotes lack of prejudice or bias (see the Piersack v. Belgium judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, p. 14, § 30). However, the Court has repeatedly held that what is at stake in maintaining the impartiality of the judiciary is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Fey v. Austria judgment of 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A, p. 12, § 30).', 'It follows that, in seeking to maintain the “authority and impartiality of the judiciary”, the Contracting States are entitled to take account of considerations going – beyond the concrete case – to the protection of the fundamental role of courts in a democratic society.', '41. In view of the above, the various reasons contained in the judgment of the Vienna Court of Appeal of 19 October 1992 (see paragraphs 17 to 22 above) are to be regarded as falling within the aim of “maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary”.', ""42. The Government submitted that the applicant's conviction also pursued the aim of protecting Mr Androsch's right to the presumption of innocence. Having regard to its analysis in the preceding paragraphs, the Court does not find it necessary to address this question separately."", 'C. Whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”', ""43. The applicant asserted that his right to freedom of expression had been restricted beyond the limits imposed by the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention. He submitted that since the subject matter of his report was the trial of a former Minister of Finance for tax offences committed when in office, indisputably an issue of public concern, the limits of permissible criticism should be wider. As to the risk of influencing the outcome of Mr Androsch's trial, he pointed out that the passage where the latter's responsibility for tax evasion was alluded to referred to activities for which Mr Androsch had already been convicted and which were well known to the court."", ""44. The Commission expressed the opinion that the Vienna Court of Appeal did not weigh the public interest in preventing undue influence of the media on pending criminal proceedings against the public interest in receiving information relating to the conduct of a former Minister of Finance facing charges of tax evasion. When examining whether the incriminated text was likely to influence the outcome of the proceedings, the appellate court, unlike the first-instance court, had not taken the wording and the content of the two-page article as a whole into account. Having regard to its specific context, the conclusion suggested by the applicant in one passage, namely that Mr Androsch was evading taxes, appeared as merely describing a state of suspicion, which the members of the trial court, including the lay judges, were in a position to evaluate independently. The Commission further observed that the appellate court should have dealt with the applicant's defence that the incriminated passage merely paraphrased a statement the public prosecutor had made at the trial."", ""The Commission accordingly concluded that the reasons adduced by the Court of Appeal were not sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 § 2. The interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression could thus not be said to have been “necessary in a democratic society” for maintaining the “authority and impartiality of the judiciary”."", '45. At the hearing, the Delegate of the Commission submitted that the question of necessity under Article 10 § 2 would have required that the domestic courts ascertain whether any real influence had indeed been exerted on the lay judges.', ""46. For the Government, the applicant's conduct went beyond the limits of permissible reporting on a pending trial. Even if the entire content of the article were to be taken into account, there was no question that the incriminated statement amounted to a typical predetermination by the media of an accused's guilt. If the statement in issue was indeed a quotation of the public prosecutor, the applicant would have had to indicate it, which he did not."", 'They further pointed out that although lay judges are likely to read press reports on the cases they try, Austrian law, unlike other legal systems, does not seek to insulate them from exposure to outside influence while they are exercising their functions. There was therefore a high probability that the opinion of Mr Worm, leading expert of the “Causa Androsch”, would exert influence on those judges, thereby jeopardising the impartiality of the court.', 'The Government finally submitted that the fine imposed on the applicant was not disproportionate to the aim pursued.', '47. The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (see, among other authorities, the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31).', 'As a matter of general principle, the “necessity” for any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, pp. 28–29, § 50). Admittedly, it is in the first place for the national authorities to assess whether there is a “pressing social need” for the restriction and, in making their assessment, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. In the present context, however, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press. Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10, whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.', ""The Court's task, in exercising its supervisory function, is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, the Court must look at the “interference” complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, among many other authorities, the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 500–01, § 40)."", ""48. In the instant case, the Vienna Court of Appeal, after carefully examining the character of the incriminated article, concluded that it was objectively capable of influencing the outcome of the proceedings. The Court of Appeal also dealt with the question of the applicant's intent in publishing the article, in particular saying that it could be inferred from the article that he wished to usurp the position of the judges dealing with the case (see paragraphs 16–21 above)."", 'The reasons given by the Court of Appeal were therefore “relevant” with regard to the aim pursued. It remains to be ascertained whether they were also “sufficient” for that same purpose.', ""49. In assessing this question, the Court recalls that the domestic margin of appreciation is not identical as regards each of the aims listed in Article 10 § 2. With respect to the notion of “authority and impartiality of the judiciary”, the Court has already noted its objective character and the fact that, in this area, the domestic law and practice of the member States of the Council of Europe reveal a fairly substantial measure of common ground (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times (no. 1) judgment cited above, p. 36, § 59). This does not mean that absolute uniformity is required and, indeed, since the Contracting States remain free to choose the measures which they consider appropriate, the Court cannot be oblivious of the substantive or procedural features of their respective domestic laws (ibid., pp. 37–38, § 61). It cannot thus hold that the applicant's conviction was contrary to Article 10 of the Convention simply because it might not have been obtained under a different legal system."", '50. Restrictions on freedom of expression permitted by the second paragraph of Article 10 “for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary” do not entitle States to restrict all forms of public discussion on matters pending before the courts.', ""There is general recognition of the fact that the courts cannot operate in a vacuum. Whilst the courts are the forum for the determination of a person's guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see paragraph 40 above), this does not mean that there can be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of criminal trials elsewhere, be it in specialised journals, in the general press or amongst the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times (no. 1) judgment cited above, p. 40, § 65)."", 'Provided that it does not overstep the bounds imposed in the interests of the proper administration of justice, reporting, including comment, on court proceedings contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public. Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (ibid.). This is all the more so where a public figure is involved, such as, in the present case, a former member of the Government. Such persons inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny by both journalists and the public at large (see, among other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 42). Accordingly, the limits of acceptable comment are wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual (ibid.).', 'However, public figures are entitled to the enjoyment of the guarantees of a fair trial set out in Article 6, which in criminal proceedings include the right to an impartial tribunal, on the same basis as every other person. This must be borne in mind by journalists when commenting on pending criminal proceedings since the limits of permissible comment may not extend to statements which are likely to prejudice, whether intentionally or not, the chances of a person receiving a fair trial or to undermine the confidence of the public in the role of the courts in the administration of criminal justice.', ""51. The applicant was convicted of having attempted to exert prohibited influence on the outcome of the criminal proceedings concerning Mr Androsch. He was sentenced to a fine of ATS 48,000, or twenty days' imprisonment in case of default of payment (see paragraph 15 above)."", 'As summarised above (see paragraphs 17–22) the Vienna Court of Appeal first considered whether the impugned article was objectively capable of influencing the outcome of the proceedings pending at the material time before the Vienna Regional Criminal Court.', ""It found that the applicant had commented unfavourably on the answers given by Mr Androsch at the trial and not merely carried out a critical psychological analysis, as held by the first-instance court. The court further considered that it could not be excluded that the members of Mr Androsch's trial court, more particularly the lay judges, might read the article. It concluded that the applicant's article fell within the ambit of section 23 of the Media Act."", ""The appellate court held that Mr Worm's long-standing involvement in the “Causa Androsch” – he had been researching into the case since 1978 and had written more than a hundred articles about it – reinforced the impression gained from the wording of the article that he had written it with the intention of influencing the outcome of the proceedings. From the beginning, the applicant had been convinced that Mr Androsch had committed tax evasion and had stated so. In his article, he had not only criticised Mr Androsch; he had deliberately attempted to lead the reader to conclude that Mr Androsch was guilty of the charges against him and had predicted his conviction."", ""52. The Court of Appeal's judgment was not directed to restricting the applicant's right to inform the public in an objective manner about the development of Mr Androsch's trial. Its criticism went essentially to the unfavourable assessment the applicant had made of the former minister's replies at trial, an element of evidence for the purposes of section 23 of the Media Act. The Court does not share the Commission's view that the passage where it is implied that Mr Androsch was evading taxes merely described a state of suspicion. In particular, the words “allows of no otherinterpretation than that Androsch was evading taxes” point rather to a clearly stated opinion that Mr Androsch was guilty of the charges against him. This view was, moreover, formulated in such absolute terms that the impression was conveyed to the reader that a criminal court could not possibly do otherwise than convict Mr Androsch."", ""53. The Court considers that it transpires from the Court of Appeal's judgment that it did take into account the incriminated article in its entirety. Further, the content of the article cannot be said to be incapable of warranting the conclusion arrived at by the Vienna Court of Appeal as to the article's potential for influencing the outcome of Mr Androsch's trial."", ""54. Having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, it was also in principle for the appellate court to evaluate the likelihood that at least the lay judges would read the article as it was to ascertain the applicant's criminal intent in publishing it. As to the latter point, the Court of Appeal pointed out that “it can be inferred from the article that [the applicant] wished to usurp the position of the judges dealing with the case” (see paragraph 20 above). In this respect, to paraphrase the Court's words in its judgment in the Sunday Times (no. 1) case (cited above), it cannot be excluded that the public's becoming accustomed to the regular spectacle of pseudo-trials in the news media might in the long run have nefarious consequences for the acceptance of the courts as the proper forum for the determination of a person's guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (p. 39, § 63). For this reason, the fact that domestic law as interpreted by the Vienna Court of Appeal did not require an actual result of influence on the particular proceedings to be proved (see paragraph 18 above) does not detract from the justification for the interference on the ground of protecting the authority of the judiciary."", ""55. The above findings are not called into question by the assertion – disregarded by the appellate court – that the incriminated passage was a quotation of a statement made by the public prosecutor at the trial. In the first place, even assuming that the public prosecutor actually made such remarks, the applicant ought to have indicated that he was merely quoting them. In any event, it was the public prosecutor's role, and not that of the applicant, to establish Mr Androsch's guilt."", ""56. Against this background, the Court concludes that the reasons adduced by the Vienna Court of Appeal to justify the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression resulting from his conviction were also “sufficient” for the purposes of Article 10 § 2. In particular, the respective interests of the applicant and the public in imparting and receiving his ideas concerning a matter of general concern which was before the courts were not such as to outweigh the considerations relied on by the Vienna Court of Appeal as to the adverse consequences of the diffusion of the impugned article for the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in Austria."", '57. Given the amount of the fine and the fact that the publishing firm was ordered to be jointly and severally liable for payment of it (see paragraph 15 above), the sanction imposed cannot be regarded as disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.', ""58. The Court accordingly finds that the national courts were entitled to consider that the applicant's conviction and sentence were “necessary in a democratic society” for maintaining both the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention."", '59. In sum, there has been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.']",3,at,001-58087,0

Mr Paul Serves is a regular officer in the French army and at the material time held the rank of captain. He was in command of the first company (“the company”) of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (“2nd Para”) and was based in the Central African Republic.', 'A. Background to the case', '8. On 5 April 1988 the company set off on a “provincial tour” in the Awajaba region in the north of the Central African Republic.', 'On 11 April the applicant called together the heads of platoon and told them that poachers had been reported to him in the presidential reserve and Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and that they were to carry out an “unofficial” investigation mission. He designated two areas; one platoon of the company, under the applicant’s command, was to investigate in one of them and a second platoon, under the command of Lieutenant C., was to investigate in the other. A third platoon was to relieve the second after forty-eight hours. The applicant said that any poachers encountered should be intercepted and, if they fled, should if necessary be fired on after a warning had been given. The operation began on the morning of 13 April.', 'On 14 April 1988 a patrol from the second platoon, commanded by Staff Sergeant B., came upon two natives who fled on seeing them. Staff Sergeant B. fired two shots, wounding one of the fugitives in the leg. On hearing of the incident from the Staff Sergeant, Lieutenant C. went to the scene with the platoon’s medical orderly, Corporal J. The injured man was treated and taken to the bivouac, where Lieutenant C. ordered Corporal D. to dig a grave. An hour after that had been done, and after being questioned, the captive, on Lieutenant C.’s orders, was dispatched by means of five shots fired by Corporal D. and then buried.', '9. The applicant was told of the incident on 15 or 16 April 1988 and ordered his men to remain silent. They returned to their camp at Bouar on 21 April. In his report on the “provincial tour” the applicant made no mention of any incident.', 'B. Inquiries by commanding officers', '10. When questioned on 22 April 1988 by Lieutenant-Colonel Champy, the commanding officer of the French operational assistance units (“the EFAO ”) in Bouar, who had heard rumours of an incident during the tour, the applicant and Lieutenant C. said that they had found a native’s body, had buried it and had not reported the matter out of discretion. They drew up reports relating this version of the events. The Central African authorities were informed on 23 April and no further inquiries were made.', '11. On 13 May 1988, however, Colonel Larrière, the commanding officer of the EFAO in the Central African Republic, was told that evidence given to the Central African police implicated his soldiers. He therefore decided to recommence the inquiry and on 15 May personally interviewed the applicant, Lieutenant C., Staff Sergeant B. and Corporal J. The applicant and Lieutenant C. confirmed the content of their original reports. As their statements differed in some respects, however, Colonel Larrière interviewed Lieutenant C. again. The lieutenant then admitted that Staff Sergeant B. had opened fire on the poacher, who had been injured in the leg and had received medical treatment at the scene of the incident. He also said that the captive had died from his injuries shortly after being taken to the bivouac and that he himself had ordered that he should be buried at once.', '12. On his return to Bangui with the applicant and Lieutenant C., Colonel Larrière had the matter reported to the Army Chief of Staff. On 17 May 1988 the Chief of Staff told the colonel that he had been in touch with the prosecutor at the Paris Military Court, that an application should be made to the EFAO military police – a gendarmerie detachment assigned during operations to a large unit or base to carry out general policing and criminal-investigation duties – and that the company was to be relieved as soon as possible.', '13. In a commanding-officer report of 20 May Colonel Larrière said that he believed Lieutenant C.’s latest statement on the circumstances of the poacher’s death. He also set out the facts described above (see paragraphs 8–12), concluded that the applicant was “wholly” responsible and asked for disciplinary penalties to be imposed on him (replacement as head of his unit and a reprimand by the Minister of Defence) and on Lieutenant C. (forty days’ arrest).', '14. The soldiers involved in the case were sent back to France on 21 May 1988. There, the applicant, Lieutenant C., Staff Sergeant B., Corporal J. and the other two heads of platoon in the unit were questioned by General Guignon, the commanding officer of the 11th Parachute Division and the 44th Territorial Army Division. In his commanding-officer report of 25 May 1988 to the Army Chief of Staff he mentioned a rumour that the poacher had been “finished off” by Corporal D. and concluded that Lieutenant C. and the applicant bore the responsibility, which was “weighty” in the latter’s case.', 'General Guignon questioned the applicant, Staff Sergeant B., Corporal J. and Lieutenant C. again. Lieutenant C. admitted that Corporal D. had, on his orders, shot the injured man in order to “put an end to the suffering of a dying man”. This was later confirmed by the corporal. A commanding-officer report of 1 June gives an account of this and concludes: “the responsibility lies mainly … with the two officers in question”.', 'C. The preliminary inquiry', '15. On 18 May 1988 Colonel Larrière had informed the commandant of the Bangui military police of the facts of the case. The commandant had opened a preliminary inquiry and on 18 and 20 May 1988 sent messages to the prosecutor at the Paris Military Court, reading as follows:', '“First: investigation being carried out by commanding officer of Bangui military police detachment (CAR) assisted by Bangui and Bouar military police personnel [;] pending proceedings do not require soldiers in question to be detained here in view of line taken by Head of State of Central African Republic.', 'Second: all personnel involved will have made statements before returning to France.', 'Third: personnel concerned will depart for Bastia with their unit on Saturday 21 May 1988 ...”', 'and', '“Further to telephone call today 20 May 1988, names of soldiers implicated in the case are', '(1) Serves, Paul, Captain.

They were charged on 19 April 1990.', '21. In connection with that investigation, the applicant was summoned to appear as a witness before the military investigating judge three times (at hearings on 12, 19 and 26 September 1990). On each occasion he attended but refused to take the oath and give evidence.', '22. At those hearings the investigating judge ordered Mr Serves to pay fines of 500 French francs (FRF), FRF 2,000 and FRF 4,000 respectively for refusing to take the oath and give evidence.', '23. The applicant appealed against those orders to the First Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal. His main argument in his pleadings was that as, in its judgment of 9 October 1989, the Division had expressly declared that the preliminary inquiry and the messages of 18 and 20 May 1988 on which his 1988 charge had been based remained effective, there was incriminating evidence against him such as enabled him to be charged, so that he could not be examined as a witness without his defence rights being infringed and a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure being committed. He further maintained that he had offered the same explanation for his refusal to the investigating judge at the first interview; this is not, however, mentioned in the records of his interviews.', '24. On 29 October 1990 the Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the orders in issue. It gave the following grounds in its judgment:', '“The application for a judicial investigation and the subsequent steps in the investigation were declared void in the judgment of 9 October 1989 of the body supervising the judicial investigation, and it follows from Article 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that no information against parties to the proceedings may be derived from documents declared void, ‘which have been removed from the investigation file and filed in the registry’, at peril of committing criminal malfeasance in public office in the case of judges and on pain of disciplinary proceedings being taken in the case of defence counsel.', 'Consequently, even if the witness Paul Serves is of the view that his counsel’s reference to documents declared void does not adversely affect him, the body supervising the investigation cannot take the same view without contravening Article 173 cited above, thereby rendering its members liable to prosecution as provided in that Article.', 'The supervisory body consequently declines to look at the documents and steps in the investigation that have been declared void.', 'Since Paul Serves was not referred to by name in the application [of 13 March 1990], the investigating judge was entitled to examine him as a witness, provided that Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was complied with.', 'Although Captain Serves’s immediate superior, General Guignon, judged that Captain Serves had committed faults that made him liable and were likely to attract a disciplinary penalty, it was for the investigating judge to assess whether the evidence obtained during the preliminary investigation and the inquiry by commanding officers, which are the only documents from the investigation concerning Captain Serves, amounted to substantial, consistent evidence of his guilt.', 'By Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigating judge had to take his decision without deriving information from the documents that had been declared void.', 'The records of the applicant’s interviews show that he refused to take the oath without offering any explanation for this unusual conduct.', 'The investigating judge was thus not put in a position to reassess whether Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was applicable in the light of hearing the witness’s explanation for this procedural difficulty.', 'As matters stand, the body supervising the judicial investigation cannot, without going beyond the scope of the application that has been made to it, consider whether or not Paul Serves should be heard as a witness.', 'The supervisory body finds that the investigating judge complied with Article 108 of the Military Criminal Code and Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '...”', '25.

Mr Serves applied to the Commission on 21 April 1992. Relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention, he complained that his being fined for refusing to take the oath before the investigating judge had infringed the rights of the defence and maintained that, in breach of his right to a fair hearing, neither the investigating judge nor the Indictment Division had taken his oral explanations into account.', '34. In its decision of 19 October 1995 the Commission (Second Chamber) considered the applicant’s complaints under Article 10 of the Convention also and declared the application (no. 20225/92) admissible. In its report of 23 May 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (twenty-five votes to two) and that no separate issue arose under Article 10 (twenty-six votes to one).

In his memorial the applicant asked the Court to “hold that the fines imposed on him ... [had been] in breach of Articles 6 § 1 and 10 of the Convention”.', '36. The Government requested the Court to “dismiss the application lodged by Mr Serves”.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'i. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION', '37. The applicant submitted, firstly, that the fines imposed on him for refusing to take the oath and give evidence before the investigating judge amounted to an infringement of his right not to incriminate himself. Secondly, he criticised the conditions in which the proceedings leading to the imposition of those fines had taken place. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention, of which the following provisions are relevant in the instant case:', '“1. In the determination of … any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair … hearing … by an independent and impartial tribunal …', '…', '3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:', '…', '(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;', '…”', 'A. The first complaint, based on Article 6 § 1 taken alone', '38. Mr Serves complained of a breach of his right not to incriminate himself, guaranteed by Article 6 § 1.', '39. It is necessary, firstly, to rule on the preliminary issue raised by the Government, relating to the applicability of that provision.', '1. Applicability of Article 6 § 1', '40. In the Government’s submission, the applicant had not at that stage of the domestic proceedings been “charged” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The first application for a judicial investigation, made on 20 May 1988, was declared void on 9 October 1989 by the First Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal; and when, on 12, 19 and 26 September 1990, Mr Serves appeared as a witness before the investigating judge and was ordered to pay the impugned fines, the second application for a judicial investigation concerning him had not yet been made and he had not been charged with an offence. In short, Article 6 § 1 was not applicable.', '41. The applicant and the Delegate of the Commission contested that submission. They said that the application of 20 May 1988 for a judicial investigation had implicated Mr Serves, who on 24 May 1988 had been charged with manslaughter and on 23 June 1988 with murder. The judgment of the First Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal of 9 October 1989 had not resulted in the removal from the case file of the evidence on which the prosecutor at the Military Court and the investigating judge had at the relevant time based their decisions. They added that General Guignon’s reports of 25 May and 1 June 1988, in which he described the role played by the various protagonists in the case and concluded that the applicant and Lieutenant C. were responsible, had been added to the case file in January 1990. Lastly, they noted that on 19 April 1990 the investigating judge had charged Lieutenant C. and not the applicant, even though the case against the latter had been no less overwhelming than the case against the former.', '42. In the instant case the Court must examine whether Mr Serves, who, when summoned to appear as a witness before the investigating judge, had neither been named in the application of 13 March 1990 for a judicial investigation nor been charged, was nevertheless the subject of a “charge” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1.', 'That concept is “autonomous”; it has to be understood within the meaning of the Convention and not solely within its meaning in domestic law. It may thus be defined as “the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence”, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether “the situation of the [suspect] has been substantially affected” (see, for example, the Deweer v. Belgium judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 22, § 42, and p. 24, § 46; and the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p. 33, § 73).', 'In that regard, the Court notes that the preliminary inquiry into the killing, which was begun on 18 May 1988, concerned four soldiers, including the applicant. The two messages sent by the commandant of the Bangui military police to the prosecutor at the Paris Military Court on 18 and 20 May 1988 named the applicant as one of the “soldiers implicated in the case” (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, in his commanding-officer report of 20 May, which was annexed to the official inquiry report of 21 May, Colonel Larrière described the applicant’s involvement in detail and concluded that he was “wholly” responsible (see paragraph 13 above). The four soldiers were, moreover, sent back to France forthwith on 21 May 1988.', 'Furthermore, the application of 20 May 1988 for a judicial investigation expressly referred to the applicant, who was charged on 24 May 1988 with manslaughter and on 23 June 1988 with murder and was detained pending trial from 24 May to 21 July 1988 (see paragraph 17 above). While it is true that on 9 October 1989 the First Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal declared void the first application for a judicial investigation and the steps subsequently taken in the proceedings, it specified that “the preliminary inquiry and the messages of [18] and 20 May 1988 remain[ed] effective” (see paragraph 18 above), so that the evidence on which the first investigation was based was not removed from the case file. Indeed, it was in particular in the light of that evidence that in March 1990 the investigation in respect of Lieutenant C. and Corporal D. was reopened (see paragraph 20 above).', 'In these circumstances, the Court accepts that when Mr Serves was summoned to appear as a witness and fined under Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he could be considered the subject of a “charge” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 1.', 'Accordingly, Article 6 § 1 is applicable in the instant case.', '2. Compliance with Article 6 § 1', '43. Mr Serves maintained that by summoning him to appear as a witness rather than charging him (as Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure required in the light of the overwhelming case against him), the investigating judge had sought to subject him to unbearable pressure so that he would incriminate himself. Unlike an accused, a witness was obliged, on pain of the penalties provided in Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to take an oath to tell the truth and to answer the questions put to him. It was therefore precisely in order to avoid the risk of self-incrimination that he had refused to take the oath and give evidence. He added that, even though it was not mentioned in the records of his interviews, he had explained to the investigating judge that his refusal was based on Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which precluded his being heard as a witness. In any event, it could not be disputed that he had given that explanation to the appellate court.', '44. The Government contended that it was for the investigating judge alone to determine whether there was “substantial, consistent evidence of guilt” against the applicant such that Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure operated to preclude his being heard as a witness; the fact that in the first phase of the proceedings the applicant had been charged could not be taken into account by the investigating judge in that connection, because the relevant proceedings had been declared void and were, therefore, deemed in law never to have existed. Accordingly, Mr Serves could not avoid his obligation in law to take the oath and give evidence. On the other hand, after answering questions and if he had been charged, he could, if appropriate, have relied on Article 105 before the appellate court and obtained a declaration that his deposition was void. In addition, there was no connection between the events in issue and the applicant’s being charged for a second time at a much later date (May 1992); that charge was brought solely because of the progress of the investigation and, in particular, the fact that new evidence against him had come to light. There had not, therefore, been a violation of Article 6.', '45. According to the Delegate of the Commission, the approach taken by the investigating judge placed the applicant in a dilemma: should he refuse to take the oath and give evidence, thereby making himself liable to repeated fines, or should he convince the judge of the overwhelming nature of the case against him and thus, ultimately, admit guilt? That had been a strategy intended to compel Mr Serves to incriminate himself.', '46. The Court reiterates that the right of any “person charged” to remain silent and the right not to incriminate himself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 of the Convention. Their rationale lies, inter alia, in protecting the “person charged” against improper compulsion by the authorities and thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the “person charged” (see the following judgments: Funke v. France, 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A, p. 22, § 44; John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 49, § 45; and Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2064, § 68).', '47. It is not for the Court to consider whether the investigating judge had an obligation under Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to charge the applicant. Its task is to decide whether the fining of the applicant pursuant to Article 109 of that Code amounted to coercion such as to render his right not to incriminate himself ineffective.', 'It is understandable that the applicant should fear that some of the evidence he might have been called upon to give before the investigating judge would have been self-incriminating. It would thus have been admissible for him to have refused to answer any questions from the judge that were likely to steer him in that direction.', 'It appears, however, from the interview records, \xad which the applicant signed, \xad that he refused at the outset to take the oath. Yet the oath is a solemn act whereby the person concerned undertakes before the investigating judge to tell, in the terms of Article 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “the whole truth and nothing but the truth”. Whilst a witness’s obligation to take the oath and the penalties imposed for failure to do so involve a degree of coercion, the latter is designed to ensure that any statements made to the judge are truthful, not to force witnesses to give evidence.', 'In other words, the fines imposed on Mr Serves did not constitute a measure such as to compel him to incriminate himself as they were imposed before such a risk ever arose.', 'Consequently, there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1.', 'B. The second complaint, based on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) taken together', '48. Mr Serves also alleged that in the proceedings in which fines were imposed on him pursuant to Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he had not had a fair hearing. The fines had been imposed without either the investigating judge or the Indictment Division having regard to his explanations based on Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In that connection, he relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention.', '49. The Government’s main argument was that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies, because he had not given the investigating judge any explanation for his refusal to take the oath and therefore had not put him in a position to decide whether Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be applied; had he done so, it might not have been necessary for the fines to be imposed. In the alternative, the Government said that a sentence imposed on a defaulting witness did not constitute a “criminal” penalty, and on that basis they contested the applicability of Article 6 § 1. They went on to say that, in any event, Mr Serves had enjoyed the safeguards afforded by Article 6 before the Indictment Division and the Court of Cassation.', '50. In its decision on the admissibility of the application the Commission said: “… there is no doubt that the applicant, who complained of the investigating judge’s conduct, raised his complaints under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention in the national courts and that those courts considered them”. In its report, after finding that Article 6 § 1 was applicable, the Commission noted that the investigating judge had not asked the applicant for any explanation of his refusals to take the oath before imposing a penalty under Article 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Itconsidered that the unfairness of the proceedings at that stage was not remedied on appeal and expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of that provision.', '51. The Court notes that Mr Serves appealed against the orders imposing the fines concerned and that at the end of proceedings which cannot be faulted under Article 6 of the Convention, the Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal dealt with his ground of appeal based on Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', ""Consequently, the Court holds, without its being necessary to consider the Government's preliminary objection, that there has been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) taken together."", 'ii. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '52. Mr Serves submitted that his being fined for refusing to take the oath before the investigating judge also infringed Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority …', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society … for maintaining the authority … of the judiciary.”', '53. The Government submitted as their main argument that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies because he had at no stage alleged in the French courts an infringement of his right to freedom of expression. In the alternative, they said that any interference with that right had been in accordance with the conditions of paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '54. In its decision on admissibility the Commission held that the applicant’s conviction could “raise an issue under Article 10”. In its report it expressed the view that, in the light of its finding of a violation of Article 6, “the complaints under Article 10 are based on the same facts and do not raise any issues of fact or of law requiring separate examination”.', '55. The Court has already considered, under Article 6 § 1, the merits of the applicant’s complaint that his right not to incriminate himself had been violated. Mr Serves did not provide any information demonstrating a need for that complaint to be considered under Article 10 also. It is therefore unnecessary to examine whether there has been a violation of that provision.']",3,fr,001-58103,0

Radio ABC is a non-profit-making association whose registered address is in Vienna. On 28 August 1989 it applied to the Post and Telecommunications Regional Head Office ( Post- und Telegraphendirektion ) for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland for a licence to set up and operate a radio station and for allocation of a frequency on which it could broadcast programmes to the Vienna region.', '8. On 9 January 1990 the Regional Head Office refused the above application. Relying on the Constitutional Law guaranteeing the independence of broadcasting (“the Constitutional Broadcasting Law”, see paragraph 16 below), which provided that activities of this type had to be authorised by federal legislation, it noted that such legislation had been enacted only in respect of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ( Österreichischer Rundfunk, “the ORF ”). Consequently, only the latter could operate in the field concerned.', '9. On 25 September 1990 the Post and Telecommunications National Head Office ( Generaldirektion für die Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant. It observed in particular that in its judgment of 16 December 1983 the Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ) had held that the ORF ’s monopoly was compatible with Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraph 18 below).', '10. Radio ABC then applied to the Constitutional Court, arguing in particular that the National Head Office’s decision was in breach of Article 10 of the Convention. It accepted that Article 10 permitted Contracting States to require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises, but submitted that since no such procedure had been laid down in Austrian law everyone had the right to broadcast freely.', '11. On 30 September 1991 the Constitutional Court refused to consider the application, holding that, regard being had to its judgment of 16 December 1983, this did not have sufficient prospects of success.', '12. After the entry into force, on 1 January 1994, of the Regional Broadcasting Law (see paragraph 19 below), the applicant association lodged two applications on 17 April 1994 in each of which it asked to be allocated one of the two frequencies reserved for private broadcasters in the Vienna region. On 25 January 1995 the Regional Broadcasting Authority ( Regionalradiobehörde ) gave two separate decisions refusing these applications on the ground that, regard being had to the requirements of section 20 (2) of the Regional Broadcasting Law, Radio ABC’s programmes were too specialised for it to be able to give them priority over those of other applicants. Radio ABC then appealed against these decisions to the Constitutional Court.', '13. As several other appeals of the same type had been lodged with it, the Constitutional Court began proceedings of its own motion, on 3 May 1995, to review the constitutionality of section 2 (1) to (3) and (5) of the Regional Broadcasting Law (see paragraph 19 below). On 27 September 1995 it annulled, with immediate effect, these provisions and the frequency allocation plan based on them (see paragraph 20 below), thereby invalidating the decisions concerning the appellants taken by the Regional Broadcasting Authority. The Constitutional Court held that the annulled provisions contravened the principle of legality ( Legalitätsprinzip ), since the conditions for their application were not indicated with sufficient precision. As a result, it continued, there was no longer any legal basis on which operating licences could be granted to radio stations, so that a situation incompatible with the Convention had been brought into being.']","['II.

In a judgment of 16 December 1983 the Constitutional Court held that the freedom to set up and operate radio and television broadcasting stations was subject to the powers accorded to the legislature under paragraph 1 in fine and paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention ( Gesetzesvorbehalt ). The Constitutional Broadcasting Law had instituted a system which made all activity of this type subject to the grant of a licence by the federal legislature. This system was intended to ensure objectivity and diversity of opinions ( Meinungsvielfalt ), and would be ineffective if it were possible for everybody to obtain the requisite authorisation. As matters stood, the right to broadcast was restricted to the ORF, as no implementing legislation had been enacted in addition to the law governing that organisation (see the Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276, pp. 8–9, § 10).', 'F. The Regional Broadcasting Law of 1993', '19. The Regional Broadcasting Law of 9 July 1993 ( Regionalradiogesetz ), which came into force on 1 January 1994, governs the licensing of local and regional radio stations. Before the judgment of 27 September 1995 (see paragraph 13 above) section 2 provided:', '“1. In agreement with the General Purposes Committee of the National Assembly ( Hauptausschuß des Nationalrates ), the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Transport shall, by means of an ordinance (the frequency allocation plan – Frequenznutzungsplan ), allocate terrestrial sound radio broadcasting capacities ( drahtlose terrestrische Übertragungskapazitäten für Hörfunk ), defined in terms of frequency and broadcasting location, to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation and radio stations ( Programmveranstalter ).', '2. In making the above allocation, the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Transport shall ensure:', '(1) that there is no impediment to performance by the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation of the tasks imposed on it by law in the field of sound radio broadcasts;', '(2) that radio stations are able to reach the widest possible audience within any one Land; and', '(3) that attention is paid to the needs of local sound radio.', '3. In the above-mentioned frequency allocation plan the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Transport shall, after consulting the Länder concerned and in agreement with the General Purposes Committee of the National Assembly, assign in accordance with paragraph 2, sub-paragraphs 2 and 3, each of the frequencies and broadcasting locations available for use by radio stations to an individual licence to broadcast within the Länder. In so doing he shall have particular regard to local topography, population density, technical parameters and Austria ’s international obligations in the field of telecommunications.', '…', '5. In urgent individual cases the telecommunications authorities ( Fernmeldebehörde ) may take decisions at variance with the frequency allocation plan, provided that within six months the plan is modified accordingly in conformity with paragraph 3.”', 'Section 4 requires the programmes of private radio stations to respect the principles of objectivity and diversity of opinion and to reflect the public, cultural and economic life of the region in which they are broadcast. Section 13 instituted regional broadcasting authorities ( Regional-radiobehörde ). Under section 20 (2), where a number of private broadcasters satisfying the statutory conditions apply for a licence, the regional broadcasting authority must give priority to the one which comes closest to achieving the objectives laid down in the Law, for example by reflecting a greater diversity of opinion.', '20. On 27 September 1995 the Constitutional Court declared paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 of section 2 null and void; accordingly, the frequency allocation plan based on them was likewise void.', '21. On 1 May 1997 the amendments replacing the annulled provisions came into force.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '22. The applicant association applied to the Commission on 30 December 1991. It alleged that the refusal to grant it an operating licence constituted an unjustified interference with its right to impart information and was in breach of Article 10 of the Convention.', '23. The Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 19736/92) admissible on 18 October 1995. In its report of 11 April 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 10. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '24. In its memorial the applicant association asked the Court to', '“hold that the Austrian authorities’ decisions ... and the Austrian Constitutional Court ’s judgment of 30 September 1991 ... either wholly or partly breach Austria ’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights”.', '25. In their memorial the Government made the following submission:', '“In respect of these considerations and of the fact that the applicant association has no absolute right under Article 10 of the Convention to be granted a broadcasting licence, the Austrian Federal Government are of the opinion that there has been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention.”', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION', '26. The applicant association complained that it had been unable to obtain a broadcasting licence, contrary to Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '27. The Court notes that the restriction complained of amounts to an “interference” with the applicant association’s exercise of its freedom to impart information and ideas; that was not contested, moreover, by any of the participants in the proceedings. Accordingly, only the question whether the restriction was justified arises.', '28. In its Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria judgment the Court held that, through the supervisory powers over the media it conferred on the authorities, the monopoly system operated in Austria was capable of contributing to the quality and balance of programmes and was consistent with the third sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 10 (judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276, p. 15, § 33). Nevertheless, as in that judgment, it remains to be determined whether in the instant case the system concerned also satisfied the relevant conditions of paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '29. The interference complained of was – and this was not disputed by any of the participants in the proceedings – “prescribed by law”. Its aim has already been held by the Court to be a legitimate one (see paragraph 28 above). On the other hand, a problem arises in connection with the question whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”.', '30. In assessing the need for an interference the Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation, but that margin goes hand in hand with European supervision. Where, as in the present case, there has been an interference with the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article 10, the supervision must be strict because of the importance – frequently stressed by the Court – of the rights in question. The necessity for any restriction must be convincingly established (see, among other authorities, the Informationsverein Lentia and Others judgment cited above, p. 15, § 35).', 'In order to determine whether that is so in the present case, the Court will consider each of four different periods separately.', '(a) First period: from the application to the Post and Telecommunications Regional Head Office (28 August 1989) to the entry into force of the Regional Broadcasting Law (1 January 1994)', '31. The Court notes that during this first period there was no legal basis whereby an operating licence could be granted to any station other than the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. In that respect the situation of Radio ABC was therefore no different from that of the applicants in the Informationsverein Lentia and Others case mentioned above. Moreover, the participants in the proceedings agreed on that point.', 'Accordingly, there was a breach of Article 10 during the period in question.', '(b) Second period: from the entry into force of the Regional Broadcasting Law (1 January 1994) to the Constitutional Court ’s judgment declaring certain provisions of that Law null and void (27 September 1995)', '32. The Government emphasised that Parliament’s intention in adopting the Regional Broadcasting Law (see paragraph 19 above) had been to draw the consequences for Austria of the Informationsverein Lentia and Others judgment cited above, but submitted that this judgment had not established an unconditional right for every radio station to obtain a broadcasting licence. On the contrary, it had recognised the State’s responsibility to preserve diversity of opinions and the objectivity and impartiality of the media, and consequently the need to impose, for that purpose, certain restrictions on freedom of expression. That was why the operating licence sought by the applicant association had been refused.', '33. The Court observes that, in its Informationsverein Lentia and Others judgment, it held that the purpose of the third sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 10 was to make it clear that States are permitted to regulate by a licensing system the way in which broadcasting is organised in their territories, particularly in its technical aspects. Technical aspects are undeniably important, but the grant or refusal of a licence may also be made conditional on other considerations, including such matters as the nature and objectives of a proposed station, its potential audience at national, regional or local level, the rights and needs of a specific audience and the obligations deriving from international legal instruments (judgment cited above, p. 14, § 32).', 'In the same judgment the Court noted that, as a result of the technical progress made over the last decades, justification for restrictions like the one in issue could no longer be found in considerations relating to the number of frequencies and channels available (p. 16, § 39). It is therefore surprising that only two frequencies were reserved for private radio stations transmitting in the Vienna region. However, it is not necessary for the Court to consider whether such a restriction is compatible with Article 10 § 2, as it resulted from a law of which certain provisions were declared null and void by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 13 above), and as this invalidated the decisions refusing Radio ABC’s applications, it put the association back in the legal situation which had obtained before that law’s entry into force, thus prolonging the violation of Article 10 already found in connection with the first period (see paragraph 31 above).', '(c) Third period: from the Constitutional Court ’s judgment (27 September 1995) to the entry into force of the amendments to the new Regional Broadcasting Law (1 May 1997)', '34. The Government submitted that the applicant’s situation had improved following the Constitutional Court’s judgment, in that if the Constitutional Court had not declared certain provisions of the Regional Broadcasting Law null and void (see paragraph 13 above), the refusal of its applications would have been final (see paragraph 12 above). It was now possible, however, with the entry into force of the amendments to the Regional Broadcasting Law (see paragraph 21 above), for the applicant association to resubmit an application.', '35. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court ’s judgment of 27 September 1995 not only invalidated the decisions refusing Radio ABC’s applications, it also prevented any further application of the Regional Broadcasting Law pending the entry into force of the amendments thereto. Accordingly, the violation of Article 10 already found in connection with the first two periods (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above) continued during the third. Indeed, the Constitutional Court itself found this situation to be in breach of the Convention (see paragraph 13 above).', '(d) Fourth period: since the entry into force of the amendments to the Regional Broadcasting Law (1 May 1997)', '36. At the hearing the Government informed the Court that the amendments replacing the provisions of the Regional Broadcasting Law declared null and void by the Constitutional Court had entered into force on 1 May 1997 (see paragraph 21 above). Under these amendments licence applications could be lodged between 1 May and 12 June 1997 and had to be determined by a decision of the relevant authorities by 31 August 1997 at the latest.', '37. The Court notes that on 27 May 1997, the date of the hearing, the amended version of the Regional Broadcasting Law had not yet been applied to the applicant association, which by that time had not submitted a licence application either. Consequently, the Court is not required to rule on the fourth period, as it is not its task to rule in abstracto whether legislation is compatible with the Convention (see, among other authorities, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 31, § 79, and the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 32, § 63). It notes with satisfaction, however, that Austria has introduced legislation to ensure the fulfilment of its obligations.', '(e) Conclusion', '38. In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION', '39. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '40. In respect of pecuniary damage, Radio ABC claimed 48,000,000 Austrian schillings (ATS), representing the surplus ( Überschuß) which the applicant association’s activity would have generated if it had been able to broadcast from 1 January 1990 onwards.', '41. The Court takes the view that this claim is based on the assumption that the applicant would have obtained the licence it sought if Austrian legislation had complied with Article 10. That assumption, however, is speculative, regard being had to the authorities’ discretion in this sphere, as the Delegate of the Commission rightly emphasised. Accordingly, no compensation is payable under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '42. In respect of the fees for its legal representation before the national authorities, and later before the Convention institutions, the applicant association claimed ATS 846,011.', '43. The Delegate of the Commission considered that sum to be “very high”, while the Government agreed to pay ATS 165,000, as in the Informationsverein Lentia and Others case cited above, if the Court were to find a violation.', '44. Making an assessment on an equitable basis and having regard to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among other authorities, the Nideröst ‑ Huber v. Switzerland judgment of 18 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 110, § 40), the Court awards ATS 200,000 under this head.', 'C. Default interest', '45. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Austria at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 4% per annum.']",3,at,001-58104,1

Mr Mehdi Zana, a Turkish citizen born in 1940, is a former mayor of Diyarbakır, where he currently lives.', 'The situation in the south-east of Turkey', '10. Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the south-east of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has so far, according to the Government, claimed the lives of 4,036 civilians and 3,884 members of the security forces.', '11. At the time of the Court’s consideration of the case, ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey had since 1987 been subjected to emergency rule.', 'B. The applicant’s statement to journalists', '12. In August 1987, while serving several sentences in Diyarbakır military prison, the applicant made the following remarks in an interview with journalists:', '“I support the PKK national liberation movement; on the other hand, I am not in favour of massacres. Anyone can make mistakes, and the PKK kill women and children by mistake …”', ""“... PKK'nın ulusal kurtuluş hareketini destekliyorum. Katliamlardan yana değiliz, yanlış şeyler her yerde olur. Kadın ve çocukları yanlışlıkla öldürüyorlar …”"", 'That statement was published in the national daily newspaper Cumhuriyet on 30 August 1987.', 'C. The criminal proceedings', '13. On 30 August 1987 the “press offences” department of the Istanbul public prosecutor’s office began a preliminary investigation in respect of the applicant among others, on the ground that he had “defended an act punishable by law as a serious crime”, an offence under Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 31 below).', '14. On 28 September 1987 the Istanbul public prosecutor’s office ruled that there was no case to answer in respect of the journalists and that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci to deal with Mr Zana’s case. It sent the file to the Diyarbakır public prosecutor.', '15. In an order of 22 October 1987 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor ruled that he had no jurisdiction, on the ground that the offence committed by the applicant was governed by Article 142 §§ 3–6 of the Criminal Code (a provision which makes it an offence to disseminate propaganda that is racist or calculated to weaken national sentiment). He forwarded the file to the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır National Security Court.', '16. On 4 November 1987 the latter likewise ruled that he had no jurisdiction, on the ground that when the applicant had made his statement to the journalists he was in custody in a military prison and therefore had military status in law. He forwarded the file to the Diyarbakır military prosecutor’s office.', '17. By means of an indictment dated 19 November 1987, the Diyarbakır military prosecutor’s office instituted proceedings in the Diyarbakır Military Court against Mr Zana (among others) under Article 312 of the Criminal Code. The applicant was charged with supporting the activities of an armed organisation, the PKK, whose aim was to break up Turkey’s national territory.', '18. At a hearing before the Diyarbakır Military Court on 15 December 1987 the applicant argued that the court had no jurisdiction to hear his case and refused to put forward a defence on the merits.', '19. At a hearing on 1 March 1988 counsel for Mr Zana asked the Military Court to rule that it had no jurisdiction as the offence with which his client was charged was not a military one and a military prison could not be regarded as military premises. The court dismissed that application on the same day.', '20. On 28 July 1988 the applicant was transferred from Diyarbakır military prison to Eskişehir civilian prison.', '21. The Eskişehir Air Force Court, acting under powers delegated to it by the Diyarbakır Military Court, summoned the applicant to submit his defence. The applicant, who was on hunger strike, did not appear at the hearing on 2 November 1988. He did appear at one held on 7 December 1988 but refused to address the court, as he considered that it had no jurisdiction to try him.', '22. In a decision of 18 April 1989 the Diyarbakır Military Court held that it had no jurisdiction in the case and sent the file to the Diyarbakır National Security Court.', '23. On 2 August 1989 Mr Zana was transferred to the high-security civilian prison at Aydın.', '24. At a hearing held on 20 June 1990 by the Aydın Assize Court, acting under powers delegated by the Diyarbakır National Security Court, the applicant refused to speak Turkish and said in Kurdish that he wished to defend himself in his mother tongue. The Assize Court pointed out to him that, if he persisted in his refusal to defend himself, he would be deemed to have waived his right to do so. Since Mr Zana continued to speak in Kurdish, the court noted in the record of the hearing that he had not put forward a defence.', 'D. The judgment of the Diyarbakır National Security Court', '25. The proceedings then continued before the Diyarbakır National Security Court, where the applicant was represented by his lawyers.', '26. In a judgment of 26 March 1991 the Diyarbakır National Security Court sentenced the applicant to twelve months’ imprisonment for having “defended an act punishable by law as a serious crime” and “endangering public safety”. In accordance with the Act of 12 April 1991, he would have to serve one-fifth of the sentence (two months and twelve days) in custody and four-fifths on parole.', '27. The National Security Court held that the PKK qualified as an “armed organisation” under Article 168 of the Criminal Code, that its aim was to bring about the secession of part of Turkey’s territory and that it committed acts of violence such as murder, kidnapping and armed robbery. The court also held that Mr Zana’s statement to the journalists, the exact terms of which had been established during the judicial investigation, amounted to an offence under Article 312 of the Criminal Code.', '28. The applicant appealed on points of law on 3 April 1991. In a judgment of 19 June 1991, served on the applicant’s representative on 18 July 1991, the Court of Cassation upheld the National Security Court’s judgment.', '29. In the meantime, on 16 April 1991, Mr Zana, who had just served the sentences imposed on him earlier, had been released.', '30. On 26 February 1992 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor requested the applicant to report to Diyarbakır Prison in order to serve his latest sentence – one-fifth of the prison term, for the remainder of which he would be on parole.', 'III. Turkey’s declaration of 22 January 1990 under Article 46 of the Convention', '33. On 22 January 1990 the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs deposited with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe the following declaration under Article 46 of the Convention:', '“On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Turkey and acting in accordance with Article 46 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I hereby declare as follows:', 'The Government of the Republic of Turkey acting in accordance with Article 46 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, hereby recognises as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in all matters concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention which relate to the exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention, performed within the boundaries of the national territory of the Republic of Turkey, and provided further that such matters have previously been examined by the Commission within the power conferred upon it by Turkey.', 'This Declaration is made on condition of reciprocity, including reciprocity of obligations assumed under the Convention. It is valid for a period of 3 years as from the date of its deposit and extends to matters raised in respect of facts, including judgments which are based on such facts which have occurred subsequent to the date of deposit of the present Declaration.”', 'That declaration was renewed on 22 January 1993 for a period of three years and again on 22 January 1996, in slightly different terms, for two years.']","['ii. Relevant domestic law', 'A. Substantive law', '31. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code at the material time provided:', 'Article 168', '“It shall be an offence punishable by at least fifteen years’ imprisonment to form an armed gang or organisation or to assume control or special responsibility within such a gang or organisation with the intention of committing any of the offences referred to in Articles 125 ...', 'It shall be an offence punishable by five to fifteen years’ imprisonment to belong to such an organisation.”', 'Article 312', '“It shall be an offence, punishable by six months’ to two years’ imprisonment and a ‘heavy’ [ağır ] fine of 6,000 to 30,000 liras publicly to praise or defend an act punishable by law as a serious crime or to urge the people to disobey the law.', 'It shall be an offence, punishable by one year’s to three years’ imprisonment and by a heavy fine of 9,000 to 36,000 liras, publicly to incite hatred or hostility between the different classes in society, thereby creating discrimination based on membership of a social class, race, religion, sect or region. Where such incitement endangers public safety, the sentence shall be increased by one-third to one-half.', '...”', 'B. Procedure', '32. Article 226 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at the material time provided:', '“A person in custody in a prison situated outside the jurisdiction of the court which is to try him may be examined by other courts.”', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '34. Mr Zana applied to the Commission on 30 September 1991. Relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 and Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, he complained of the length of the criminal proceedings, of an infringement of his right to a fair trial in that he had not been able to appear before the court which convicted him and had not been able to defend himself in his mother tongue (Kurdish), and of an interference with his freedom of thought and expression.', '35. On 21 October 1993 the Commission declared the application (no. 18954/91) admissible as to the complaints concerning the length of the criminal proceedings, the applicant’s absence from the hearing and the interference with his freedom of thought and expression and declared it inadmissible as to the remainder. In its report of 10 April 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that', '(a) there had not been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (fourteen votes to fourteen, with the President’s casting vote);', '(b) there had been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention because the applicant had not been present at his trial (unanimously);', '(c) there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in that his case had not been heard within a reasonable time (twenty-three votes to five).', 'The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'final submissions to the court', '36. In their memorial the Government requested the Court', '“(a) to declare that it has no jurisdiction ratione temporis as regards the complaint under Article 10 of the Convention;', '(b) to declare that domestic remedies have not been duly exhausted as regards the complaints under Article 6 of the Convention;', 'in the alternative,', '(a) to declare that domestic remedies have not been duly exhausted as regards the complaints under Article 10 of the Convention;', '(b) to declare that there has not been a breach as regards the complaints under Article 6 of the Convention; and', 'in the further alternative,', 'to declare that there has been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention.”', '37. At the hearing, counsel for the applicant asked the Court to dismiss all the Government’s preliminary objections and to rule that there had been breaches of Article 10 and Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c).', 'as to the law', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '38. Mr Zana maintained that his conviction by the Diyarbakır National Security Court on account of his statement to journalists had infringed hisright to freedom of expression. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '39. He also complained of an interference with his right to freedom of thought, guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention. Like the Commission, the Court considers that this complaint is bound up with the one made under Article 10.', 'The Government’s preliminary objections', '40. The Government raised two preliminary objections, one based on lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis and the other on failure to exhaust domestic remedies.', 'Lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis', '41. The Government maintained, as their primary submission, that the Court had no jurisdiction ratione temporis to entertain the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention, given that the principal fact lay in the applicant’s declaration to journalists in August 1987 (see paragraph 12 above), that is to say before Turkey recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. When, on 22 January 1990, Turkey had recognised the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction in “matters raised in respect of facts, including judgments which are based on such facts which have occurred subsequent to” that date, its intention had been, they said, to remove from the ambit of the Court’s review events that had taken place before the date on which the declaration made under Article 46 of the Convention was deposited and also judgments relating to such facts even if they had been delivered after that date.', '42. The Court points out that Turkey accepted its jurisdiction only in respect of facts and events subsequent to 22 January 1990, when it deposited its declaration (see paragraph 33 above). In the instant case, however, the Court considers, like the Delegate of the Commission, that the principal fact lay not in Mr Zana’s statement to the journalists but in the Diyarbakır National Security Court’s judgment of 26 March 1991, whereby the applicant was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment for having “defended an act punishable by law as a serious crime” under Turkish legislation (see paragraph 26 above), a judgment that was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 26 June 1991 (see paragraph 28 above). It was that conviction and sentence, subsequent to Turkey’s recognition of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, which constituted the “interference” within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention and whose justification under that Article the Court must determine. This preliminary objection must accordingly be dismissed.', 'The question whether the Government should, in the light of their reference of the case to the Court (see paragraph 1 above), be regarded as estopped from relying on the terms of the declaration of 22 January 1990 to exclude this complaint on grounds of incompetence ratione temporis was not raised before the Court and the Court does not consider it necessary, in the circumstances, to determine that question.', 'Failure to exhaust domestic remedies', '43. In the alternative, the Government pleaded failure to exhaust domestic remedies. Mr Zana, they said, had omitted to raise in substance his complaint under Article 10 of the Convention in the Turkish courts.', '44. Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court notes that this objection was not raised when the admissibility of the application was being considered and that there is therefore an estoppel.', 'Merits of the complaint', '45. As the Court has already pointed out (see paragraph 42 above), the applicant’s conviction and sentence by the Turkish courts for remarks made to journalists indisputably amounted to an “interference” with his exercise of his freedom of expression. This point was, indeed, not contested.', '46. The interference contravened Article 10 unless it was “prescribed by law”, had one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such an aim or aims.', '“Prescribed by law”', '47. The Court notes that the applicant’s conviction and sentence were based on Articles 168 and 312 of the Turkish Criminal Code (see paragraph 31 above) and accordingly considers that the impugned interference was “prescribed by law”. This point was likewise undisputed.', 'Legitimacy of the aims pursued', '48. The Government maintained that the interference had pursued legitimate aims, namely the maintenance of national security and public safety, the preservation of territorial integrity and the prevention of crime. As the PKK was an illegal terrorist organisation, the application of Article 312 of the Turkish Criminal Code by the national courts in the case had had the aim of punishing any act calculated to afford support to that type of organisation.', '49. In the Commission’s view, such a statement from a person with some political standing – the applicant is a former mayor of Diyarbakır – could reasonably lead the national authorities to fear a stepping up of terrorist activities in the country. The authorities had therefore been entitled to consider that there was a threat to national security and public safety and that measures were necessary to preserve the country’s territorial integrity and prevent crime.', '50. The Court notes that in the interview he gave the journalists the applicant indicated that he supported “the PKK national liberation movement” (see paragraph 12 above) and, as the Commission noted, the applicant’s statement coincided with the murders of civilians by PKK militants.', 'That being so, it considers that at a time when serious disturbances were raging in south-east Turkey (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) such a statement – coming from a political figure well known in the region – could have an impact such as to justify the national authorities’ taking a measure designed to maintain national security and public safety. The interference complained of therefore pursued legitimate aims under Article 10 § 2.', 'Necessity of the interference', '(a) General principles', '51. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles which emerge from its judgments relating to Article 10:', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see the following judgments: Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49; Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 41; and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 37).', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see the Lingens judgment cited above, p. 25, § 39).', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see the Lingens judgment cited above, pp. 25–26, § 40; and the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, § 28). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the Jersild judgment cited above, p. 26, § 31).', '(b) Application of the above principles to the instant case', '52. Mr Zana submitted that his conviction and sentence were wholly unjustified. An activist in the Kurdish cause since the 1960s, he had always spoken out against violence. In maintaining that he was supporting the PKK’s armed struggle, the Government had, he argued, misinterpreted what he had said. In reality he had told the journalists that he supported the national liberation movement but was opposed to violence, and he had condemned the massacres of women and children. At all events, he was not a member of the PKK and had been imprisoned for belonging to the “Path of Freedom” organisation, which had always advocated non-violent action.', '53. The Government, on the other hand, maintained that the applicant’s conviction and sentence were perfectly justified under paragraph 2 of Article 10. They emphasised the seriousness of what the applicant had said at a time when the PKK had carried out a number of murderous attacks in south-east Turkey. In their submission, a State faced with a terrorist situation that threatened its territorial integrity had to have a wider margin of appreciation than it would have if the situation in question had consequences only for individuals.', '54. The Commission accepted the Government’s views for the most part and expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 10.', '55. The Court considers that the principles set out in paragraph 51 above also apply to measures taken by national authorities to maintain national security and public safety as part of the fight against terrorism. In this connection, it must, with due regard to the circumstances of each case and a State’s margin of appreciation, ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the individual’s fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic society’s legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organisations.', '56. In the instant case the Court must consequently assess whether Mr Zana’s conviction and sentence answered a “pressing social need” and whether they were “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued”. To that end, it considers it important to analyse the content of the applicant’s remarks in the light of the situation prevailing in south-east Turkey at the time.', '57. The Court takes as a basis the applicant’s statement as published in the national daily newspaper Cumhuriyet on 30 August 1987 (see paragraph 12 above), which the applicant did not contest in substance. The statement comprises two sentences. In the first of these the applicant expresses his support for the “PKK national liberation movement”, while going on to say that he is not “in favour of massacres”. In the second he says “Anyone can make mistakes, and the PKK kill women and children by mistake.”', '58. Those words could be interpreted in several ways but, at all events, they are both contradictory and ambiguous. They are contradictory because it would seem difficult simultaneously to support the PKK, a terrorist organisation which resorts to violence to achieve its ends, and to declare oneself opposed to massacres; they are ambiguous because whilst Mr Zana disapproves of the massacres of women and children, he at the same time describes them as “mistakes” that anybody could make.', '59. The statement cannot, however, be looked at in isolation. It had a special significance in the circumstances of the case, as the applicant must have realised. As the Court noted earlier (see paragraph 50 above), the interview coincided with murderous attacks carried out by the PKK on civilians in south-east Turkey, where there was extreme tension at the material time.', '60. In those circumstances the support given to the PKK – described as a “national liberation movement” – by the former mayor of Diyarbakır, the most important city in south-east Turkey, in an interview published in a major national daily newspaper, had to be regarded as likely to exacerbate an already explosive situation in that region.', '61. The Court accordingly considers that the penalty imposed on the applicant could reasonably be regarded as answering a “pressing social need” and that the reasons adduced by the national authorities are “relevant and sufficient”; at all events, the applicant served only one-fifth of his sentence in prison (see paragraph 26 above).', '62. Having regard to all these factors and to the margin of appreciation which national authorities have in such a case, the Court considers that the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. There has consequently been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'II. alleged violation of article 6 of the convention', '63. Mr Zana complained of an infringement of the principle of a fair trial as he had been unable to appear at the hearing before the Diyarbakır National Security Court, and also of the length of the criminal proceedings against him. He relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention, which provide:', '“1. In the determination of … any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair … hearing within a reasonable time by [a] … tribunal …', '… 3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: … (c) to defend himself in person …”', 'The Government’s preliminary objection', '64. The Government pleaded, as their principal submission, failure to exhaust domestic remedies. The applicant, they said, had omitted to raise in substance his complaints under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 in the Turkish courts.', '65. Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court notes that this objection was not raised when the application’s admissibility was considered and that there is therefore an estoppel.', 'Merits of the complaints', 'Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention (fair trial)', '66. Mr Zana submitted that his absence from the hearing at the National Security Court had prevented him from defending himself effectively. Had he been present, he would have been able to explain to the judges what his intentions had been when he had made his statement to the journalists.', '67. The Government maintained that the applicant had several times appeared before courts acting under delegated powers, as provided in Article 226 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 32 above). In doing no more than raise objections to jurisdiction and in refusing to speak Turkish at those different hearings, Mr Zana had deliberately waived his right to defend himself on the merits. Furthermore, the presence of his lawyers at the hearing before the Diyarbakır National Security Court had been sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c).', '68. The Court reiterates that the object and purpose of Article 6 of the Convention taken as a whole show that a person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to take part in the hearing. Moreover, sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph 3 guarantee to “everyone charged with a criminal offence” the right “to defend himself in person” and “to examine or have examined witnesses”, and it is difficult to see how these rights could be exercised without the person concerned being present (see the Colozza v. Italy judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, § 27; and the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, § 58).', '69. In the instant case the Court notes that Mr Zana was not requested to attend the hearing before the Diyarbakır National Security Court, which sentenced him to a twelve-month prison term (see paragraph 26 above). In accordance with Article 226 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Aydın Assize Court had been asked to take evidence from him in his defence, under powers delegated by the National Security Court (see paragraphs 24 and 32 above).', '70. Contrary to the Government’s contention, the fact that the applicant raised procedural objections or wished to address the court in Kurdish, as he did at the hearing in the Aydın Assize Court, in no way signifies that he implicitly waived his right to defend himself and to appear before the Diyarbakır National Security Court. Waiver of the exercise of a right guaranteed by the Convention must be established in an unequivocal manner (see the Colozza judgment cited above, p. 14, § 28).', '71. In view of what was at stake for Mr Zana, who had been sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment, the National Security Court could not, if the trial was to be fair, give judgment without a direct assessment of the applicant’s evidence given in person (see, mutatis mutandis, the Botten v. Norway judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 145, § 53). If the applicant had been present at the hearing, he would have had an opportunity, in particular, to say what his intentions had been when he had made his statement and in what circumstances the interview had taken place, to summon journalists as witnesses or to seek production of the recording.', '72. Neither the “indirect” hearing by the Aydın Assize Court nor the presence of the applicant’s lawyers at the hearing before the Diyarbakır National Security Court can compensate for the absence of the accused.', '73. The Court accordingly considers, as the Commission did, that such an interference with the rights of the defence cannot be justified, regard being had to the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial within the meaning of the Convention.', 'There has consequently been a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.', 'Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (length of the proceedings)', '(a) Period to be taken into consideration', '74. The proceedings began on 30 August 1987, when the preliminary investigation in respect of the applicant was begun (see paragraph 13 above), and ended on 18 July 1991, when the Court of Cassation’s judgment was served (see paragraph 28 above). They therefore lasted for almost three years and eleven months.', 'However, the Court can take cognisance of the complaint relating to the length of the criminal proceedings only from 22 January 1990, when the declaration whereby Turkey recognised the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction was deposited (see paragraph 33 above). It must nevertheless take account of the state of the proceedings at the time when the aforementioned declaration was deposited (see, as the most recent authority, the Mitap and Müftüoğlü v. Turkey judgment of 25 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 410, § 28). On the critical date the proceedings had already lasted two years and five months.', '(b) Reasonableness of the length of the proceedings', '75. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case and the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities. It is also necessary to take account of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see the Philis v. Greece (no. 2) judgment of 27 June 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1083, § 35).', '76. In Mr Zana’s submission, the case had not been complex and the excessive length of the criminal proceedings had been due solely to the conduct of the judicial authorities: his case had been transferred from the civil courts to the National Security Court, then to the Military Court and finally back to the National Security Court, going from Istanbul to Diyarbakır, then to Eskişehir and Aydın and finally back to Diyarbakır.', '77. The Government underlined the issues of jurisdiction ratione loci and ratione materiae which the national courts had had to determine in that the applicant had made his statement in Diyarbakır military prison and it had appeared in a daily newspaper published in Istanbul. Furthermore, the attempts to find a co-defendant on the run and the conduct of Mr Zana and his lawyers had contributed to prolonging the proceedings in question. Lastly, the Court of Cassation’s judgment had been delivered two years and two months after the Diyarbakır Military Court’s decision that it had no jurisdiction.', '78. The Court considers, as the Commission did, that the proceedings complained of were not particularly complex, the facts of the case being straightforward, notwithstanding the issues of jurisdiction that could arise.', '79. As to the applicant’s conduct, the Court reiterates that Article 6 does not require a person charged with a criminal offence to cooperate actively with the judicial authorities (see, among other authorities, the Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 21, § 66). It considers, like the Commission, that the applicant’s conduct, even if it may to some extent have slowed down the proceedings, cannot, on its own, explain such a length of time.', '80. The Court also notes that between 22 January 1990, when the declaration whereby Turkey recognised the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction was deposited (see paragraph 33 above), and 18 July 1991, when the Court of Cassation’s judgment was served (see paragraph 28 above), one year and six months elapsed. In that period the Diyarbakır National Security Court did not deliver its judgment until 26 March 1991 (see paragraph 26 above), that it is to say nine months after the hearing of 20 June 1990 at the Aydın Assize Court (see paragraph 24 above), during which the applicant had refused to speak Turkish.', '81. The Commission also noted a period of inactivity attributable to the judicial authorities between the hearing before the Diyarbakır Military Court on 15 December 1987 (see paragraph 18 above), during which the applicant raised an objection to that court’s jurisdiction, and the Military Court’s decision of 18 April 1989 in which the court declared it had no jurisdiction (see paragraph 22 above).', '82. Even if this latter period does not, strictly speaking, come within the Court’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, it may nonetheless be taken into account in assessing whether the “reasonable time” requirement was satisfied.', '83. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention guarantees to everyone against whom criminal proceedings are brought the right to a final decision within a reasonable time on the charge against him. It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet this requirement (see, among many other authorities, the Mansur v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-B, p. 53, § 68).', '84. Lastly, what was at stake in the case was important to the applicant as he was already in custody when he made his statement to the journalists and was sentenced to a further term of imprisonment by the Diyarbakır National Security Court (see paragraph 26 above).', '85. In the light of all the circumstances of the case, the Court cannot regard the length of the proceedings complained of as reasonable.', 'There has consequently been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in this respect.', 'III. Application of article 50 of the convention', '86. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'Damage', '87. Mr Zana sought 250,000 French francs (FRF) for pecuniary damage and FRF 1,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage. He pointed to the ill-treatment he had allegedly sustained during his unlawful detention, the after-effects of which he was still suffering; the excessive length of the criminal proceedings had, moreover, prevented him from being given concurrent sentences, as provided in Law no. 3713 on the prevention of terrorism.', '88. Referring to their preliminary objections and to their observations on the merits, the Government requested the Court, as their main submission, to dismiss the claim. In the alternative, they maintained that any finding of a breach would constitute sufficient just satisfaction; in the further alternative, there was no causal link between any violation of the Convention and the alleged damage.', '89. The Delegate of the Commission was in favour of awarding the applicant, if a breach of Article 6 was found, compensation in the amount of FRF 40,000, half of it in respect of the applicant’s absence from his trial and the other half in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings.', '90. As regards pecuniary damage, the Court considers that there is no causal link between the breaches found of Article 6 and the alleged damage. It does, on the other hand, consider that Mr Zana sustained indisputable non-pecuniary damage, for which the findings of breaches in paragraphs 73 and 85 above cannot compensate on their own. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards him the sum of FRF 40,000 under this head, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.', 'Costs and fees', '91. The applicant also sought reimbursement of the costs incurred and fees paid for his defence in Turkey and before the Convention institutions, which he estimated at FRF 142,000 in all.', '92. In the Government’s submission, the amounts claimed were excessive and unjustified.', '93. The Delegate of the Commission proposed awarding FRF 30,000 for lawyers’ fees and allowing reimbursement of the costs to the extent that they appeared justified.', '94. On the basis of its case-law and the information in its possession, the Court decides on an equitable basis to award Mr Zana the sum of FRF 30,000 to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, less the sum of FRF 20,980 received from the Council of Europe in legal aid.', 'Default interest', '95. The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment, which is 3.87% per annum.']",3,tr,001-58115,0

The applicant was a conscripted probationary reserve officer holding the rank of second lieutenant.', '11. In the course of his military service, the applicant claimed to have discovered a number of abuses committed against conscripts and came into conflict with his superiors as a result. Criminal and disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him. The former ended with his acquittal. However, a disciplinary penalty was imposed on him, as a result of which he had to serve additional time in the army.', '12. On 30 April 1989 the applicant was granted twenty-four hours’ leave. He failed to return to his unit after its expiry. He was declared a deserter on 6 May 1989 and criminal charges were brought against him.', '13. On 10 May 1989 the applicant sent a letter to his unit’s commanding officer through a taxi driver.', '14. The letter read as follows:', '“PERSONAL STATEMENT', 'After two whole years of military service as reserve officer cadet, I am obliged to inform you that I object to the prolongation of my military service following a penalty imposed on me for defending soldiers’ rights. Judging from my experience to this date, I think that it was imposed as part of a general approach intended to suppress both freedom of personality and the vindication of constitutional rights and personal freedom. Apart from the personal cost, I generally consider that imposing a penalty on young soldiers is inadmissible and unconstitutional, all the more so when such penalty is related to the struggle of young people for respect for the ideological – social human rights of people and [their struggle] to defend their personality against the humiliations of the military apparatus. Having maintained for twenty-four months a fighting stance and a conscious position on that subject, I reserve the right, which is also a duty, to establish social justice and peace, now more than ever and, being fully aware of my actions which are imperatively dictated to me in the interests of society, hereby to DENOUNCE:', 'That the army is an apparatus opposed to man and society and, by its nature, contrary to peace.', 'I am now absolutely certain that the process of military service is responsible for crimes and aggressiveness in society since it has created a psychology of violence, overcoming in this manner all moral and psychological resistance to violence. The army remains a criminal and terrorist apparatus which, by creating an atmosphere of intimidation and reducing to tatters the spiritual welfare of the radical youth, clearly aims at transforming people to mere parts of an apparatus of domination which ruins human nature and transforms human relations from relations of friendship and love to relations of dependence, through a hierarchy of fear guided by an illiberal and oppressing set of Standing Orders (No. 20-1), records of political beliefs, etc. The truth is that the living conditions in the army are unacceptable to the point of being destructive and any healthy form of resistance and any effort towards dialogue are persecuted and brought defenceless before the military justice, a dangerous institution that should be abolished. All this happens despite the electoral announcements of the Ministry of National Defence concerning respect for the personality of the soldiers; in reality, the Ministry participates in and encourages such oppressive processes. By this means of protest, I and all young people who feel a deep sense of injustice because their life has been reduced to tatters, FIGHT:', 'To stop all forms of persecution of those who have participated in processes that promote social justice, peace and the right to have an opinion on issues that concern our lives; for the Ministry to have the political will to control in a meaningful manner the military power and to prosecute those who are really responsible for this authoritarianism, instead of systematically covering for them; for the State to establish once and for all respect for the initiatives and social choices of young people, by eliminating all penalties for the promotion of such ideals. It should not content itself with “socialist vocabulary” and then follow the practice of extermination; to declare that the elimination of these authoritarian institutions is a matter of a multi-faceted and long struggle at a personal, political and social level; to put an end to discrimination, favouritism and dependency, all of these being methods used by corrupt organs.', 'Thus, having gone through this experience, I have developed a free conscience which prevents me from taking part in and being an accomplice to this criminal process, both in its operation and in its structure, and refuse from now on to wear my uniform in these conditions. If I were to wear it, I feel that I would find myself in a crisis of conscience, contrary to my nature and beliefs as a man brought up with liberal ideas. We, the young generation, will resist any attempt to be burdened with weaknesses and become vehicles of the military establishment. This is why my stance cannot be lawfully considered to be desertion or insubordination, since it stems from fundamental human rights and is in conformity with the provisions of the Greek Constitution. I consider that I remain a citizen and a free man who sought to remain true to his conscience and the free will flowing from it. I also consider that my stance and the voicing of my protest against this humiliation are the most genuine expression of solidarity with and support for conscientious objectors because I firmly believe that this is how the struggle for social liberation and peace is carried on.”', '15. A fellow reserve officer testified before the Ioannina Permanent Army Tribunal (see paragraph 18 below) that the applicant gave him a copy of the letter on 10 May 1989. It has not been alleged that any further copies were circulated.', 'B. The criminal proceedings against the applicant', '16. Taking the view that the content of the letter constituted an insult to the armed forces, the commanding officer instituted further criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below).', '17. On 12 May 1989 the applicant appeared before the investigating officer, a member of the army judicial corps, who remanded him in custody on a charge of desertion.', '1. Proceedings in the Permanent Army Tribunal', '18. The applicant was tried on 27 June 198 9 by the Permanent Army Tribunal of Ioannina on charges of desertion and insulting the army.', 'At the outset of the trial the defence challenged the constitutionality of the second charge on the ground that the relevant criminal provision was not lex certa and that the expression of criticism could not amount to an insult. That preliminary objection was dismissed.', '19. At the close of the hearing the president of the court formulated a series of questions which the members of the court had to address before deciding on the applicant’s guilt. The questions relating to the insult charge were the following:', '“(a) Did the accused commit the offence of insulting the Greek army when, on 10 May 1989, while a reserve officer on probation, he sent a two-page typed personal statement to the commanding officer of the X unit, which came to the latter’s knowledge on the same day and which contained, inter alia, the following expressions contemptuous of, and disparaging, the authority of the army: ‘... [T]he army is an apparatus opposed to man and society ... [t]he army remains a criminal and terrorist apparatus which, by creating an atmosphere of intimidation and reducing to tatters the spiritual welfare of the radical youth, clearly aims at transforming people to mere parts of an apparatus of domination which ruins human nature and transforms human relations from relations of friendship and love to relations of dependence, through a hierarchy of fear guided by an illiberal and oppressive set of Standing Orders (No. 20-1), records of political beliefs, etc. ...’. In so doing, did he wilfully insult the Greek army as a constitutionally entrenched institution of the Nation?', '(b) ... [did the applicant act] in the mistaken but bona fide belief that he was engaging in permissible criticism, in accordance with Article 14 of the Constitution currently in force?”', '20. In a judgment delivered the same day the court, by a unanimous vote, answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative. The applicant was found guilty of desertion and insulting the army. Taking into account the fact that the applicant was a first-offender, the court sentenced him to imprisonment for one year and eight months for the first offence and three months for the second offence, and ordered him to serve a global sentence of one year and ten months.', '2. Proceedings in the Military Appeal Court', '21. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Military Appeal Court which was heard on 5 September 1989. In a judgment delivered the same day the court quashed the applicant’s conviction for desertion. However, it upheld, by three votes to two, his conviction for insulting the army after dismissing his objection that the relevant provision was contrary to the Constitution and, taking into account that the applicant had no previous convictions, sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. The applicant was immediately released, the time he had spent in detention on remand being credited against his sentence.', '3. Proceedings in the Court of Cassation', '22. On 20 September 1989 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation ( Arios Pagos ), on the ground that Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code had not been correctly construed and applied. He argued, inter alia, that general criticism of the armed forces could not be considered an insult. He claimed in addition that the provision in question violated the Constitution because of its vagueness and could not be considered lex certa, and also that it imposed unwarranted limitations on the right to freedom of expression.', '23. The applicant’s appeal on points of law was heard by a Chamber of the Court of Cassation on 12 March 1991. On 26 June 1991 the Chamber of the Court of Cassation decided to submit the case to the plenary court, having considered, by three votes to two, that Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code did not violate the Constitution and that it had been correctly applied in the applicant’s case.', '24. In a judgment delivered on 22 September 1993 the plenary Court of Cassation considered that Article 74 of the Code sufficiently circumscribed the elements of the offence, namely the insult and the intention of the culprit. Elaborating on this point, the court held that', '“[t]he concept of ‘insult’ includes every show of contempt damaging the esteem, and respect for, and the reputation of, the protected value. To qualify as an insult, such expression must convey contempt, taunt and denigration; it is not sufficient merely to call into question the protected value. This value is the armed forces and, more particularly, not the army or air force and the navy individually, but the armed forces in their entirety as an idea and an institution entrusted with defending the freedom and independence of the country and the necessary training of Greeks who are able to bear arms. Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code does not specify the nature of the insult nor the manner and means by which the insult is made, as it was not the intention of the legislature to make insulting behaviour of a particular kind, or committed in a particular manner, or by a particular means, a criminal offence. Any insult of the army by a member of the armed forces constitutes a criminal offence. This does not create any uncertainty as to the elements of the offence. Any further specification would have limited the scope of the criminal prohibition, which the legislature did not intend. Article 14 of the Constitution, which protects freedom of opinion, does not in any way preclude the legislature from making every instance of insulting the army by a member of the armed forces a criminal offence. The protection of Article 14 is subject to limitations provided for by law ...”', 'For these reasons, the plenary Court of Cassation upheld the applicant’s conviction.']","['II. Relevant domestic law', '25. Article 14 § 1 of the Greek Constitution provides:', '“Every person may express and propagate his thoughts orally, in writing and through the press in compliance with the laws of the State.”', '26. Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code provides:', '“ Insults to the flag or the armed forces', 'A member of the armed forces who insults the flag, the armed forces or an emblem of their command shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of at least six months. If he is an officer, he shall also be stripped of his rank.”', '27. A corresponding civilian offence is defined by Article 181 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:', '“ Insults to authorities and to symbols', '1. Any person shall be punished with imprisonment for up to two years who:', 'a) publicly insults the Prime Minister of the country, the Government, Parliament, the Speaker of Parliament, the leaders of the political parties recognised by the Rules of Parliament and the judicial authorities;', 'b) insults or, as a display of hatred or contempt, damages or disfigures an emblem or symbol of State sovereignty or the President of the Republic.', '2. Criticism in itself shall not constitute an insult of an authority.”', '28. A new Military Criminal Code entered into force in 1995. Article 58 of that Code provides:', '“A member of the armed forces who, by speech, actions or any other means whatsoever, publicly expresses contempt for the flag, the armed forces or a symbol of their authority, shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of at least three months.”', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '29. Mr Grigoriades applied to the Commission on 17 March 1994. He alleged a violation of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. He also claimed to have been convicted under an imprecise provision of criminal law, contrary to Article 7 of the Convention.', '30. The Commission declared the application (no. 24348/94) admissible on 4 September 1995. In its report of 25 June 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (twenty-eight votes to one) but not of Article 7 (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'Final submissions to the court by the government', '31. The Government concluded their memorial by expressing the opinion that the applicant’s allegations that Articles 7 and 10 of the Convention had been violated were unfounded.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '32. The applicant alleged that his conviction for insulting the army constituted a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, which provides as follows:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Commission agreed with the applicant that there had been a violation of that provision. The Government disputed this.', 'Whether there has been an “interference” with the applicant’s rights under Article 10', '33. It was common ground that the applicant’s conviction of insulting the army, and the sentence of three months imposed on him, constituted an interference with his freedom of expression, guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 10.', 'The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise.', 'Whether the interference was “prescribed by law”', '34. It was not disputed by the applicant that his conviction had a basis in national law, namely Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code as in force at the time. On the other hand, the applicant maintained that that provision had not been precise enough to satisfy the foreseeability requirement that flows from the expression “prescribed by law”.', 'The wording of the provision was, in his contention, over-broad. As had been recognised by the Greek Court of Cassation itself in its judgment concerning the present case, Article 74 did not define the concept of “insult” or specify acts considered to be insulting. Nor was there any case-law under that provision which might offer guidance.', 'The case-law cited by the Government concerning Article 181 of the Criminal Code, which defined the corresponding civilian offence of insulting authorities and symbols of authority, was irrelevant. Firstly, Article 181 of the Criminal Code was a different and unrelated provision in any case, and secondly, the expression used in that provision and accordingly construed by the case-law was based on a verb meaning “to insult”, unlike Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code, which used another verb which could be more accurately translated as “to offend”.', '35. The Government argued that the offence of insulting the army under Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code was a specific instance of insulting authority as defined by Article 181 of the Criminal Code, so that the construction placed on the latter provision could serve to clarify the former as well.', '36. The Commission considered that Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code did not differ in any way from other statutory provisions which made “insult” a criminal offence.', '37. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned – if need be with appropriate legal advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.', '38. It is true that Article 74 of the Greek Military Criminal Code was couched in very broad terms. Nonetheless, in the Court’s view, it met the above standard. On the ordinary meaning of the word “insult” – which is akin to the expression “offend” – it ought to have been clear to the applicant that he risked incurring a criminal sanction. It follows that the interference complained of was “prescribed by law”.', 'C. Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim', '39. The Government contended that the measures taken against the applicant under Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code had been intended to safeguard the effectiveness of the army in fulfilling its purpose, which was to protect Greek society against external or internal threats. They had therefore pursued the aims of protecting national security, territorial integrity and public safety, which were legitimate under Article 10 § 2.', '40. The applicant offered no argument to the contrary. The Commission considered that the applicant’s conviction pursued a legitimate aim “to the extent that it [had been] imposed to maintain discipline in the army”.', '41. The Court has no doubt that an effective military defence requires the maintenance of an appropriate measure of discipline in the armed forces and accordingly finds that the interference complained of pursued at any rate the legitimate aims of protecting national security and public safety invoked by the Government.', 'Whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”', '1. Arguments before the Court', '42. The applicant, with whom the Commission concurred in substance, argued that his conviction for insulting the army had not been necessary.', 'He pointed, first of all, to the factual context in which he had written the letter in question to his commanding officer. Throughout the two years of his military service, he had striven to improve the lot of conscripted soldiers. He alleged that it was as a result of this activity that a disciplinary penalty had been imposed on him in the form of an additional period of military service. When he had refused to serve for this additional period, he had been charged with desertion; it was at that point that, indignant at what he perceived as an injustice, he had written the letter. Ultimately, the trial courts had acquitted him of desertion and thus shown his indignation to have been justified.', 'Admittedly, the letter had contained strong views but they had to be seen as permissible criticism, the limits of which were wider with regard to the various arms of the executive than in relation to a private citizen. The letter did not contain any insults directed at any individual. More importantly, the letter was not a public document, having been sent only to the applicant’s commanding officer; to the extent that it had later become public, that had been due solely to the latter’s actions in bringing about the applicant’s prosecution. In those circumstances, and despite the fact that the letter had been seen by one other conscript, its potential for undermining military discipline had been insignificant.', 'Finally, the applicant expressed the opinion that the penal sanction imposed, namely a term of imprisonment of three months, had been disproportionate. His commanding officer had had the option of imposing a disciplinary penalty instead of resorting to full-blown criminal proceedings, or a lesser sentence could have been imposed.', '43. The Government did not agree that the sanction imposed on the applicant had gone beyond what could be considered “necessary in a democratic society”.', 'Making it an offence to insult the army did not, in their view, affect the essence of the freedom of expression. It merely met the need to counter excessive use of that freedom, namely, by a member of the armed forces and against the army. In particular, given the special exigencies of military life, it was necessary to resort to the criminal law to maintain military discipline and thus the effectiveness and prestige of the armed forces.', 'The letter itself had been phrased in insulting terms, calling the Greek army a “criminal and terrorist apparatus”. It had not contained any specific criticism or allegations of actual violations of the rights of conscripts.', 'The nature of the letter as a threat to discipline was also apparent from the fact that it had been addressed to a superior officer. The applicant’s remarks had not been made in the more innocuous context of, for instance, an informal discussion between officers of the same rank.', 'Moreover, the applicant had had the letter delivered to his commanding officer by a taxi driver. That method of delivery did not offer the guarantees of privacy offered by the Greek postal service. In addition, the applicant had given a copy of the letter to a fellow conscript officer. In the circumstances, it was incorrect to consider the letter a mere private expression of opinions.', 'Finally, since the time the applicant had spent in prison was set off against the time spent in detention on remand and he had not sought a suspended sentence, as he might have done, the sanction imposed had not in itself been disproportionate.', '2. The Court’s assessment', '44. The Court has stated the applicable principles as follows in its judgment in the case of Vogt v. Germany (judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 25–26, § 52):', '“(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘information’ or ‘ideas’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘democratic society’. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see the following judgments: Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49; Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 41; and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 37).', '(ii) The adjective ‘necessary’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘pressing social need’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘restriction’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘relevant and sufficient’ (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, p. 29, § 50). In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the above-mentioned Jersild judgment, p. 26, § 31).”', '45. Article 10 does not stop at the gates of army barracks. It applies to military personnel as to all other persons within the jurisdiction of the Contracting States. Nevertheless, as the Court has previously indicated, it must be open to the State to impose restrictions on freedom of expression where there is a real threat to military discipline, as the proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent servicemen from undermining it (see the Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi v Austria judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, p. 17, § 36). It is not, however, open to the national authorities to rely on such rules for the purpose of frustrating the expression of opinions, even if these are directed against the army as an institution.', '46. In the present case the applicant had a letter delivered to his commanding officer which the latter considered insulting to the armed forces (see paragraph 14 above). The commanding officer decided for that reason to take the matter further and to institute proceedings against the applicant under Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code (see paragraph 16 above).', '47. It is true that the contents of the letter included certain strong and intemperate remarks concerning the armed forces in Greece. However, the Court notes that those remarks were made in the context of a general and lengthy discourse critical of army life and the army as an institution. The letter was not published by the applicant or disseminated by him to a wider audience – apart from one other officer who apparently had been given a copy of it – and it has not been alleged that any other person had knowledge of it. Nor did it contain any insults directed against either the recipient of the letter or any other person. Against such a background the Court considers the objective impact on military discipline to have been insignificant.', '48. The Court accordingly considers that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant cannot be justified as “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (see paragraph 44 above). There has thus been a violation of that Article.', 'II. Alleged violation of Article 7 of the Convention', '49. The applicant also claimed that Article 74 of the Military Criminal Code was not sufficiently precise to satisfy the requirement of foreseeability. He alleged a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.”', '50. This complaint coincides with the applicant’s allegation that his conviction and sentence were not “prescribed by law”. The Court refers to paragraph 38 above and finds, on the grounds there stated, that there has been no violation of Article 7.', 'iii. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION', '51. Article 50 of the Convention provides as follows:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'The applicant sought damages as well as reimbursement of his costs and expenses.', 'Damage', '52. The applicant claimed 5,000,000 drachmas (GRD) for non-pecuniary damage caused by his imprisonment and by the difficulties which, owing to his conviction, he had had in finding a job as a journalist.', '53. The Government noted that the applicant had not had to spend a single day in prison following his conviction. The sentence had been set off against the time which he had spent in detention on remand on the charge of desertion. It had never been suggested that his detention as such had been in violation of the Convention.', '54. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment.', '55. The Court agrees with the Government. Given that the actual reason for the applicant’s detention, the desertion charge, was not before the Court, no award related to the applicant’s prison sentence can be made.', 'Nor can it be accepted without corroboration that the applicant would have found employment any sooner had he not been convicted.', 'It follows that no causal link has been established between the violation of Article 10 found and the damage alleged. That being so the Court holds that the finding of a violation provides sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage which the applicant may have suffered.', 'Costs and expenses', '56. The applicant claimed GRD 1,000,000 in respect of costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the domestic courts.', 'His costs and expenses before the Convention institutions were itemised as follows:', '(a) GRD 1,000,000 for the proceedings before the Commission;', '(b) GRD 800,000 for the proceedings before the Court;', '(c) GRD 500,000 for travel and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with his appearance and that of his representative before the Court.', 'His claims in respect of costs and expenses thus totalled GRD 3,300,000.', '57. As regards the domestic proceedings, the Government noted that the applicant had been tried on two charges, on one of which (the desertion charge) he had been acquitted. Only the costs referable to the charge of insult of the army fell to be considered by the Court. They considered GRD 400,000 to be a reasonable sum.', '58. As regards the Strasbourg proceedings, the Government did not contest the sum claimed in respect of the proceedings before the Commission. However, they pointed out that the applicant had not submitted a memorial to the Court and contended that the Court should award no more than GRD 250,000 for the proceedings before it. They further stated that the applicant’s presence in person at the Court’s hearing had served no useful purpose and therefore asked the Court to award only half the sum claimed in respect of travel and subsistence expenses, to cover only the costs incurred by his lawyer.', '59. As regards the costs and expenses incurred in attending the hearing, the Court cannot agree with the Government that the applicant’s presence served no useful purpose (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 16, § 33).', 'Deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant a global sum of GRD 2,000,000, plus any value-added tax that may be payable, in respect of costs and expenses.', 'Default interest', '60. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Greece at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 6% per annum.']",3,gr,001-58116,1

The United Communist Party of Turkey (“the TBKP ”), the first applicant, was a political party that was dissolved by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 10 below).', 'Mr Nihat Sargın and Mr Nabi Yağcı, the second and third applicants, were respectively Chairman and General Secretary of the TBKP. They live in Istanbul.', '8. The TBKP was formed on 4 June 1990. On the same day, its constitution and programme were submitted to the office of Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation for assessment of their compatibility with the Constitution and Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties (“Law no. 2820” – see paragraph 12 below).', 'A. The application to have the TBKP dissolved', '9. On 14 June 1990, when the TBKP was preparing to participate in a general election, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation (“Principal State Counsel”) applied to the Constitutional Court for an order dissolving the TBKP. He accused the party of having sought to establish the domination of one social class over the others (Articles 6, 10 and 14 and former Article 68 of the Constitution and section 78 of Law no. 2820), of having incorporated the word “communist” into its name (contrary to section 96(3) of Law no. 2820), of having carried on activities likely to undermine the territorial integrity of the State and the unity of the nation (Articles 2, 3 and 66 and former Article 68 of the Constitution, and sections 78 and 81 of Law no. 2820) and of having declared itself to be the successor to a previously dissolved political party, the Turkish Workers’ Party (section 96(2) of Law no. 2820).', 'In support of his application Principal State Counsel relied in particular on passages from the TBKP ’s programme, mainly taken from a chapter entitled “Towards a peaceful, democratic and fair solution for the Kurdish problem”; that chapter read as follows:', '“The existence of the Kurds and their legitimate rights have been denied ever since the Republic was founded, although the national war of independence was waged with their support. The authorities have responded to the awakening of Kurdish national consciousness with bans, oppression and terror. Racist, militarist and chauvinistic policies have exacerbated the Kurdish problem. That fact both constitutes an obstacle to the democratisation of Turkey and serves the interests of the international imperialist and militaristic forces seeking to heighten tension in the Middle East, set peoples against each other and propel Turkey into military adventures.', 'The Kurdish problem is a political one arising from the denial of the Kurdish people’s existence, national identity and rights. It therefore cannot be resolved by oppression, terror and military means. Recourse to violence means that the right to self-determination, which is a natural and inalienable right of all peoples, is not exercised jointly, but separately and unilaterally. The remedy for this problem is political. If the oppression of the Kurdish people and discrimination against them are to end, Turks and Kurds must unite.', 'The TBKP will strive for a peaceful, democratic and fair solution of the Kurdish problem, so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together of their free will within the borders of the Turkish Republic, on the basis of equal rights and with a view to democratic restructuring founded on their common interests.', 'The solution of the Kurdish problem must be based on the free will of the Kurds and take into account the common interests of the Turkish and Kurdish nations and contribute to the democratisation of Turkey and peace in the Middle East.', 'A solution to the Kurdish problem will only be found if the parties concerned are able to express their opinions freely, if they agree not to resort to violence in any form in order to resolve the problem and if they are able to take part in politics with their own national identity.', 'The solution of the Kurdish problem will require time. In the immediate future, priority must be given to ending military and political pressure on the Kurds, protecting the lives of Kurdish citizens, bringing the state of emergency to an end, abandoning the ‘village guards’ system and lifting bans on the Kurdish language and Kurdish culture. The problem should be freely discussed. The existence of the Kurds must be acknowledged in the Constitution.', 'Without a solution of the Kurdish problem, democratic renewal cannot take place in Turkey. Any solution will entail a fight for the democratisation of Turkey.”', 'Two other passages relied on by Principal State Counsel read as follows:', '“... the United Communist Party of Turkey is the party of the working class, formed from the merger of the Turkish Workers’ Party and the Turkish Communist Party.', '...', 'The cultural revival will be fashioned by, on the one hand, the reciprocal influence of contemporary universal culture and, on the other, Turkish and Kurdish national values, the heritage of the Anatolian civilisations, the humanist elements of Islamic culture and all the values developed by our people in their effort to evolve with their times.”', 'The Turkish Workers’ Party referred to above had been dissolved on 16 October 1981 on grounds similar to those relied on against the TBKP.', 'B. Dissolution of the TBKP', '10. On 16 July 1991 the Constitutional Court made an order dissolving the TBKP, which entailed ipso jure the liquidation of the party and the transfer of its assets to the Treasury, in accordance with section 107(1) of Law no. 2820. The order was published in the Official Gazette on 28 January 1992. As a consequence, the founders and managers of the party were banned from holding similar office in any other political body (Article 69 of the Constitution and section 95(1) of Law no. 2820 – see paragraph 11 below).', 'The Constitutional Court firstly rejected the submission that the TBKP maintained that one social class, the proletariat, was superior to the others. Referring to the party’s constitution, modern works on Marxist ideology and contemporary political ideas, it held that the TBKP satisfied the requirements of democracy, which was based on political pluralism, universal suffrage and freedom to take part in politics.', 'The court also rejected the argument, based on section 96(2) of Law no. 2820, that no political party may claim to be the successor to a party that has previously been dissolved. In its view, it was entirely natural and consistent with the concept of democracy for a political party to claim the cultural heritage of past movements and currents of political thought. The TBKP had accordingly not infringed the provision relied on by reason only of its intention of drawing on the experience and achievements of Marxist institutions.', 'The Constitutional Court went on to hold that the mere fact that a political party included in its name a word prohibited by section 96(3) of Law no. 2820, as the TBKP had done in the present case, sufficed to trigger the application of that provision and consequently to entail the dissolution of the party concerned.', 'As to the allegation that the TBKP ’s constitution and programme contained statements likely to undermine the territorial integrity of the State and the unity of the nation, the Constitutional Court noted, inter alia, that those documents referred to two nations: the Kurdish nation and the Turkish nation. But it could not be accepted that there were two nations within the Republic of Turkey, whose citizens, whatever their ethnic origin, had Turkish nationality. In reality the proposals in the party constitution covering support for non-Turkish languages and cultures were intended to create minorities, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation.', 'Reiterating that self-determination and regional autonomy were prohibited by the Constitution, the Constitutional Court said that the State was unitary, the country indivisible and that there was only one nation. It considered that national unity was achieved through the integration of communities and individuals who, irrespective of their ethnic origin and on an equal footing, formed the nation and founded the State. In Turkey there were no “minorities” or “national minorities”, other than those referred to in the Treaty of Lausanne and the friendship treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria, and there were no constitutional or legislative provisions allowing distinctions to be made between citizens. Like all nationals of foreign descent, nationals of Kurdish origin could express their identity, but the Constitution and the law precluded them from forming a nation or a minority distinct from the Turkish nation. Consequently, objectives which, like those of the TBKP, encouraged separatism and the division of the Turkish nation were unacceptable and justified dissolving the party concerned.']","['II. Relevant domestic law', 'The Constitution', '11. At the material time the relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows:', 'Article 2', '“The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State based on the rule of law, respectful of human rights in a spirit of social peace, national solidarity and justice, adhering to the nationalism of Atatürk and resting on the fundamental principles set out in the Preamble.”', 'Article 3 § 1', '“The State of Turkey constitutes with its territory and nation, an indivisible whole.

The applicants sought a declaration that “the facts on which the application is based ... constitute a violation of Article 11 of the Convention and of Articles 1 and 3 of Protocol No. 1”.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11 OF THE CONVENTION', '18. The applicants maintained that the fact that the United Communist Party of Turkey (“the TBKP ”) had been dissolved and its leaders – including Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı – banned from holding similar office in any other political party had infringed their right to freedom of association, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.”', 'Applicability of Article 11', '1. Submissions of those appearing before the Court', '(a) The Government', '19. The Government submitted that Article 11 did not in any event apply to political parties. Where in its constitution or programme a party attacked a State’s constitutional order, the Court should declare the Convention to be inapplicable ratione materiae or apply Article 17, rather than apply Article 11.', 'Even a cursory examination of the Convention showed that neither Article 11 nor any other Article made any mention of political parties or referred to the States’ constitutional structures. It was significant that the only Article containing a reference to political institutions was in Protocol No. 1 (Article 3) and did not confer any right on individuals as it was worded so as to create an obligation on the States.', 'Unlike other forms of association, which were usually dealt with in national constitutions as manifestations of freedom of association, the provisions concerning political parties were in general to be found in the part relating to fundamental constitutional structures. That was so, for instance, in Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy and Greece.', '20. The constitution and programme of the TBKP were clearly incompatible with Turkey’s fundamental constitutional principles. By choosing to call itself “communist”, the TBKP perforce referred to a subversive doctrine and a totalitarian political goal that undermined Turkey’s political and territorial unity and jeopardised the fundamental principles of its public law, such as secularism. “Communism” invariably presupposed seizing power and aimed to establish a political order that would be unacceptable, not just in Turkey but also in the other member States of the Council of Europe. Further, the use of certain names was also proscribed in other legal systems in the West. In that respect, the Government referred to the German, Polish and Portuguese Constitutions. In any event, whatever the intentions of the TBKP and its leaders in choosing the name “communist” in 1990 (after the fall of the Berlin Wall) may have been, that name could not, in the Government’s view, be considered devoid of political meaning.', '21. Furthermore, if the TBKP were able to achieve its political aims, Turkey’s territorial and national integrity would be seriously undermined. By drawing a distinction in its constitution and programme between Turks and Kurds, referring to the Kurds’ “national” identity, requesting constitutional recognition of “the existence of the Kurds”, describing the Kurds as a “nation” and asserting their right to self-determination, the TBKP had opened up a split that would destroy the basis of citizenship, which was independent of ethnic origin. As that was tantamount to challenging the very principles underpinning the State, the Constitutional Court had had to review the constitutionality of that political aim. In so doing, it had followed the line taken by the German Constitutional Court in its judgment of 31 October 1991 on the right of foreign nationals to vote in local elections and by the French Constitutional Council in its decision of 9 May 1991 on the status of Corsica.', 'In the Government’s submission, the States Parties to the Convention had at no stage intended to submit their constitutional institutions, and in particular the principles they considered to be the essential conditions of their existence, to review by the Strasbourg institutions. For that reason, where a political party such as the TBKP had called those institutions or principles into question, it could not seek application of the Convention or its Protocols.', 'At the very least, Article 17 of the Convention should be applied in respect of the TBKP since the party had called into question both the bases of the Convention and the freedoms it secured. In that connection, the Government cited the Commission’s decisions in the cases of Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands (application nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, p. 187); Kühnen v. Germany (application no. 12194/86, DR 56, p. 205); H., W., P. and K. v. Austria (application no. 12774/87, DR 62, p. 216); and Remer v. Germany (application no. 25096/94, DR 82-A, p. 117). In a context of vicious terrorism such as Turkey was experiencing, the need to preclude improper use of the Convention by applying Article 17 was even more obvious, as the Turkish authorities had to prohibit the use of “expressions” and the formation of “associations” that would inevitably incite violence and enmity between the various sections of Turkish society.', '(b) The applicants', '22. The applicants maintained that there was no doubt that political parties came within the ambit of Article 11. They pointed out that the scope of the Convention could not be restricted by relying on the Turkish Constitution. Domestic law had to be construed in the light of the Convention, not the other way round.', '(c) The Commission', '23. The Commission expressed the opinion that there was nothing in the wording of Article 11 to limit its scope to a particular form of association or group or suggest that it did not apply to political parties. On the contrary, if Article 11 was considered to be a legal safeguard that ensured the proper functioning of democracy, political parties were one of the most important forms of association it protected. In that connection, the Commission referred to a number of decisions in which it had examined, under Article 11, various restrictions on the activities of political parties and even the dissolution of such parties, thereby implicitly accepting that Article 11 applied to that type of association (see the German Communist Party case, application no. 250/57, Yearbook 1, p. 222; the Greek case, Yearbook 12, p. 170, § 392; the France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands v. Turkey case, applications nos. 9940–9944/82, DR 35, p. 143).', 'At the hearing before the Court the Delegate of the Commission also said that it was unnecessary to apply Article 17 of the Convention since the present case was clearly distinguishable from the rare cases in which the Commission had had recourse to that provision. In such cases the aim of the offending actions of the applicants concerned had been to spread violence (see the German Communist Party case cited above) or hatred (see the Remer case cited above). Conversely, there was nothing in the TBKP ’s constitution or programme to suggest that it was not a democratic party, or that it resorted to illegal or undemocratic methods, encouraged the use of violence, aimed to undermine Turkey’s democratic and pluralist political system or pursued objectives that were racist or likely to destroy the rights and freedoms of others.', '2. The Court’s assessment', '24. The Court considers that the wording of Article 11 provides an initial indication as to whether political parties may rely on that provision. It notes that although Article 11 refers to “freedom of association with others, including the right to form … trade unions …”, the conjunction “including” clearly shows that trade unions are but one example among others of the form in which the right to freedom of association may be exercised. It is therefore not possible to conclude, as the Government did, that by referring to trade unions – for reasons related mainly to issues that were current at the time – those who drafted the Convention intended to exclude political parties from the scope of Article 11.', '25. However, even more persuasive than the wording of Article 11, in the Court’s view, is the fact that political parties are a form of association essential to the proper functioning of democracy. In view of the importance of democracy in the Convention system (see paragraph 45 below), there can be no doubt that political parties come within the scope of Article 11.', '26. As to the Government’s allegation that the TBKP had called Turkey’s constitutional order into question and the inferences that were to be drawn from that fact, it should be said at the outset that at this stage the Court does not have to decide whether that allegation is true or whether it could be sustained solely on the basis of the constitution and programme of the party concerned. The Court refers in this connection to its observations concerning the necessity of the impugned interference (see paragraphs 42 ‑ 47 below).', '27. The Court notes on the other hand that an association, including a political party, is not excluded from the protection afforded by the Convention simply because its activities are regarded by the national authorities as undermining the constitutional structures of the State and calling for the imposition of restrictions. As the Court has said in the past, while it is in principle open to the national authorities to take such action as they consider necessary to respect the rule of law or to give effect to constitutional rights, they must do so in a manner which is compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 29, § 69).', '28. The Preamble to the Convention refers to the “common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law” (see paragraph 45 below), of which national constitutions are in fact often the first embodiment. Through its system of collective enforcement of the rights it establishes (see the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 23 March 1995 ( preliminary objections ), Series A no. 310, p. 26, § 70), the Convention reinforces, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the protection afforded at national level, but never limits it (Article 60 of the Convention).', '29. The Court points out, moreover, that Article 1 requires the States Parties to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention”. That provision, together with Articles 14, 2 to 13 and 63, demarcates the scope of the Convention ratione personae, materiae and loci (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 90, § 238). It makes no distinction as to the type of rule or measure concerned and does not exclude any part of the member States’ “jurisdiction” from scrutiny under the Convention. It is, therefore, with respect to their “jurisdiction” as a whole – which is often exercised in the first place through the Constitution – that the States Parties are called on to show compliance with the Convention.', '30. The political and institutional organisation of the member States must accordingly respect the rights and principles enshrined in the Convention. It matters little in this context whether the provisions in issue are constitutional (see, for example, the Gitonas and Others v. Greece judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV) or merely legislative (see, for example, the Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113). From the moment that such provisions are the means by which the State concerned exercises its jurisdiction, they are subject to review under the Convention.', '31. Moreover, it may on occasion prove difficult, even artificial, in proceedings before the Court, to attempt to distinguish between what forms part of a State’s institutional structures and what relates to fundamental rights in the strict sense. That is particularly true of an order for dissolution of the kind in issue in the present case. In view of the role played by political parties (see paragraph 25 above), such measures affect both freedom of association and, consequently, democracy in the State concerned.', '32. It does not, however, follow that the authorities of a State in which an association, through its activities, jeopardises that State’s institutions are deprived of the right to protect those institutions. In this connection, the Court points out that it has previously held that some compromise between the requirements of defending democratic society and individual rights is inherent in the system of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 28, § 59). For there to be a compromise of that sort any intervention by the authorities must be in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11, which the Court considers below (see paragraphs 37 et seq.). Only when that review is complete will the Court be in a position to decide, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, whether Article 17 of the Convention should be applied.', '33. Before the Commission the Government also submitted, in the alternative, that while Article 11 guaranteed freedom to form an association, it did not on that account prevent one from being dissolved.', 'The Commission took the view that freedom of association not only concerned the right to form a political party but also guaranteed the right of such a party, once formed, to carry on its political activities freely.', 'The Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (see, among other authorities, the Artico v. Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 16, § 33, and the Loizidou judgment cited above, p. 27, § 72). The right guaranteed by Article 11 would be largely theoretical and illusory if it were limited to the founding of an association, since the national authorities could immediately disband the association without having to comply with the Convention. It follows that the protection afforded by Article 11 lasts for an association’s entire life and that dissolution of an association by a country’s authorities must accordingly satisfy the requirements of paragraph 2 of that provision (see paragraphs 35–47 below).', '34. In conclusion Article 11 is applicable to the facts of the case.', 'B. Compliance with Article 11', 'Whether there has been an interference', '35. Before the Commission, the Government submitted that the dissolution of the TBKP had not constituted an interference with Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı’s right to freedom of association. However, it did not reiterate that argument before the Court.', '36. Like the Commission, the Court concludes that there has been an interference with that right in respect of all three applicants, having regard (in the case of Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı) to their role as founders and leaders of the party and to the ban which prevented them from discharging similar responsibilities in any other political grouping (see paragraph 10 above).', '2. Whether the interference was justified', '37. Such an interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims.', '(a) “Prescribed by law”', '38. It was common ground that the interference was “prescribed by law”, as the measures ordered by the Constitutional Court were based on Articles 2, 3 § 1, 6, 10 § 1 and 14 § 1, and former Article 68 of the Constitution and sections 78, 81 and 96(3) of Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties (see paragraphs 11–12 above).', '(b) Legitimate aim', '39. The Government maintained that the interference pursued a number of legitimate aims: ensuring national security, public safety and territorial integrity and protecting the rights and freedoms of others. If the Court had accepted, as it had done in the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment of 16 December 1992 (Series A no. 252), that an isolated case of espionage could harm national security, there was all the more reason to reach a similar conclusion where, as in the instant case, the very existence of a State Party to the Convention was threatened.', '40. The Commission distinguished between the different grounds relied on by the Constitutional Court for dissolving the TBKP. Inasmuch as the interference was based on the use of the word “communist” in the party’s name, it could not, in the Commission’s view, be said to be justified by any of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 11. Indeed, the Constitutional Court had recognised that there was nothing to suggest that the TBKP would not respect democratic institutions or that it intended to establish a dictatorship. In addition, Law no. 3713 on the prevention of terrorism, which came into force on 12 April 1991, had repealed the provisions of the Criminal Code making it an offence to participate in organisations or activities that professed to be, inter alia, communist in inspiration.', 'On the other hand, inasmuch as the dissolution was based on a distinction drawn in the TBKP’s programme between Turks and Kurds, it could, in the Commission’s view, be said to have been ordered with the aim of protecting territorial integrity and thus “national security”. It was not that the TBKP was a terrorist organisation or one sponsoring terrorism, but it could be regarded as openly pursuing the creation of a separate Kurdish nation and consequently a redistribution of the territory of the Turkish State.', '41. Like the Commission, the Court considers that the dissolution of the TBKP pursued at least one of the “legitimate aims” set out in Article 11: the protection of “national security”.', '(c) “Necessary in a democratic society”', '1. General principles', '42. The Court reiterates that notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 must also be considered in the light of Article 10. The protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms of assembly and association as enshrined in Article 11 (see, among other authorities, the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, § 57, and the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 30, § 64).', '43. That applies all the more in relation to political parties in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy (see paragraph 25 above).', 'As the Court has said many times, there can be no democracy without pluralism. It is for that reason that freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 is applicable, subject to paragraph 2, not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb (see, among many other authorities, the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 25, § 52). The fact that their activities form part of a collective exercise of freedom of expression in itself entitles political parties to seek the protection of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.', '44. In the Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria judgment the Court described the State as the ultimate guarantor of the principle of pluralism (see the judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276, p. 16, § 38). In the political sphere that responsibility means that the State is under the obligation, among others, to hold, in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. Such expression is inconceivable without the participation of a plurality of political parties representing the different shades of opinion to be found within a country’s population. By relaying this range of opinion, not only within political institutions but also – with the help of the media – at all levels of social life, political parties make an irreplaceable contribution to political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 42, and the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, § 43).', '45. Democracy is without doubt a fundamental feature of the European public order (see the Loizidou judgment cited above, p. 27, § 75).', 'That is apparent, firstly, from the Preamble to the Convention, which establishes a very clear connection between the Convention and democracy by stating that the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are best ensured on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understanding and observance of human rights (see the Klass and Others judgment cited above, p. 28, § 59). The Preamble goes on to affirm that European countries have a common heritage of political tradition, ideals, freedom and the rule of law. The Court has observed that in that common heritage are to be found the underlying values of the Convention (see the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 35, § 88); it has pointed out several times that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23, p. 27, § 53, and the Soering judgment cited above, p. 34, § 87).', 'In addition, Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention require that interference with the exercise of the rights they enshrine must be assessed by the yardstick of what is “necessary in a democratic society”. The only type of necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of those rights is, therefore, one which may claim to spring from “democratic society”. Democracy thus appears to be the only political model contemplated by the Convention and, accordingly, the only one compatible with it.', 'The Court has identified certain provisions of the Convention as being characteristic of democratic society. Thus in its very first judgment it held that in a “democratic society within the meaning of the Preamble and the other clauses of the Convention”, proceedings before the judiciary should be conducted in the presence of the parties and in public and that that fundamental principle was upheld in Article 6 of the Convention (see the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 14 November 1960 ( preliminary objections and questions of procedure ), Series A no. 1, p. 13). In a field closer to the one concerned in the instant case, the Court has on many occasions stated, for example, that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment (see, among other authorities, the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 25, § 52), whereas in the Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt judgment cited above it noted the prime importance of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which enshrines a characteristic principle of an effective political democracy (p. 22, § 47).', '46. Consequently, the exceptions set out in Article 11 are, where political parties are concerned, to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on such parties’ freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts. The Court has already held that such scrutiny was necessary in a case concerning a Member of Parliament who had been convicted of proffering insults (see the Castells judgment cited above, pp. 22–23, § 42); such scrutiny is all the more necessary where an entire political party is dissolved and its leaders banned from carrying on any similar activity in the future.', '47. When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 31).', '2. Application of the principles to the present case', '(i) Submissions of those appearing before the Court', 'The applicants', '48. The applicants argued that the reasons given by the Constitutional Court for dissolving the TBKP were ill-founded. In their submission, there was a contradiction in penalising a political party in July 1991 for calling itself “communist” when, on the one hand, it had not been an offence since April 1991 to carry on activities inspired by communist ideology and, on the other, the Constitutional Court had itself accepted that the TBKP was not seeking the domination of one social class over the others and that its constitution and programme were in accordance with democratic principles.', 'As to the separatist activities attributed to the TBKP by the Government, the applicants affirmed that there was no basis for such an allegation either in the party’s documents or in the statements of its members. On the contrary, the party’s constitution was very clear on that point when it stated that the Kurdish problem required a fair, democratic and peaceful solution and the voluntary co-existence of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples within Turkish territory on the basis of equal rights. The TBKP was therefore not opposed to the territorial integrity of the country and had never advocated separatism. Further, the party’s leaders had not been prosecuted under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, which made it a capital offence actively to support separatism. The fact remained, however, that the authorities considered the mere use of the word “Kurd” to be discriminatory, even though the problem was such that any political party wishing to resolve it could not avoid mentioning it. The problem existed and minority groups existed, but political parties could not refer to them.', 'Lastly, with regard to the allegation that the TBKP was a terrorist association, the applicants pointed out that it had been dissolved only ten days after it was formed so that it had had no time for any activity whatsoever. The TBKP ’s future activities could therefore only have been a matter for speculation and could not have formed the basis for a decision to dissolve the party.', 'The Government', '49. The Government pointed out that freedom of association – like freedom of expression – was not absolute and often conflicted with other paramount interests in a democratic society. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation had to be gauged in the light of the legitimate aim pursued by the interference and the background to the facts of the case. In that regard, the Government referred to the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996 ( Reports 1996-V), in which the Court had, when assessing the facts, taken into account the needs arising from their historical context.', 'If the TBKP ’s constitution and programme were analysed in a similar way, a pressing need to impose the impugned restriction in circumstances in which territorial integrity and national security were threatened would be found not just in the case of Turkey, but also in that of each of the Council of Europe’s member States. What was at stake was the essential conditions for a State’s existence in the international order, conditions which were even guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations.', 'Further, it was apparent from the case-law that where the interference pursued as a legitimate aim the protection of public order, territorial integrity, the public interest or democracy, the Convention institutions did not require that the risk of violence justifying the interference should be real, current or imminent. As authority for that proposition, the Government cited the decisions in which the Commission had declared inadmissible the cases of X v. Austria (application no. 5321/71, Collection of Decisions 42, p. 105), T. v. Belgium (application no. 9777/82, DR 34, p. 158) and Association A. and H. v. Austria (application no. 9905/82, DR 36, p. 187). In addition, the Commission had accepted in two German cases that restrictions on freedom of expression could be justified by national-security considerations without its being necessary to determine whether the exercise of freedom of expression had had any practical implications (see the Kuck v. Germany case, application no. 29742/96, and the Fleischle v. Germany case, application no. 29744/96). Lastly, in the Purcell and Others v. Ireland case, the Commission had taken into account the terrorist threat and the public interest in countering it (application no. 15404/89, DR 70, p. 262).', 'In all those cases the actual content of the expressions concerned had sufficed to warrant the conclusion that restrictions had to be imposed on their use, without its being necessary to determine whether there was a current risk of violence or a causal link with an act of violence directly provoked by the use of the expression. On the other hand, in the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976 (Series A no. 24), the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979 (Series A no. 30), and the Lingens and Castells judgments cited above, in all of which the Court had held that there had been a violation of Article 10, the publications concerned had not called into question the very existence of the State and the democratic order.', 'In short, faced with a challenge to the fundamental interests of the national community, such as national security and territorial integrity, the Turkish authorities had not in any way exceeded the margin of appreciation conferred on them by the Convention.', 'The Commission', '50. At the hearing before the Court the Delegate of the Commission, in a preliminary observation, stressed the difference between implementing an illegal programme and implementing one in which all that was sought was a change in the law. While that distinction could sometimes be difficult to draw in practice, associations, including political parties, should be able to campaign for a change in the law or the legal and constitutional structures of the State, provided of course that the means used for the purpose were in all respects lawful and democratic and that the proposed change was itself compatible with fundamental democratic principles.', 'The Commission considered that the rule that freedom of expression extends to “information” and “ideas” that offend, shock or disturb (see, among many other authorities, the Handyside judgment cited above) also applied in the present case with regard to Article 11, since the order for dissolving the TBKP had been made solely on the basis of information and ideas expressed in its constitution and programme.', 'Further, the Commission noted that in order to justify dissolving the TBKP, the Constitutional Court had relied on passages that formed only a small part of the party’s constitution. Moreover, those passages did not contain any incitement to violence but, on the contrary, showed the TBKP ’s desire to achieve its objectives – even those in regard to the position of the population of Kurdish origin – by democratic means and in accordance with Turkish laws and institutions.', '(ii) The Court’s assessment', '51. The Court notes at the outset that the TBKP was dissolved even before it had been able to start its activities and that the dissolution was therefore ordered solely on the basis of the TBKP ’s constitution and programme, which however – as is for that matter apparent from the Constitutional Court’s decision – contain nothing to suggest that they did not reflect the party’s true objectives and its leaders’ true intentions (see paragraph 58 below). Like the national authorities, the Court will therefore take those documents as a basis for assessing whether the interference in question was necessary.', '52. It is to be noted further that in support of his application for a dissolution order, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation made four submissions. Two of these were rejected by the Constitutional Court: the claim that the TBKP intended to maintain that the proletariat was superior to the other social classes and the argument that it was contrary to section 96(2) of Law no. 2820 for it to claim to be the successor to a political party that had previously been dissolved – the Turkish Workers’ Party (see paragraph 9 above).', 'The Court can therefore confine its review to the other two grounds, which were upheld by the Constitutional Court.', '53. In the first of these it was alleged that the TBKP had included the word “communist” in its name, contrary to section 96(3) of Law no. 2820 (see paragraph 12 above). The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that that provision prohibited the formation of political parties on a purely formal ground: the mere fact of using a name proscribed in that section sufficed to trigger its application and consequently to entail the dissolution of any political party that, like the TBKP, had contravened it (see paragraph 10 above).', '54. The Court considers that a political party’s choice of name cannot in principle justify a measure as drastic as dissolution, in the absence of other relevant and sufficient circumstances.', 'In this connection, it must be noted, firstly, that on 12 April 1991 the provisions of the Criminal Code making it a criminal offence to carry on political activities inspired, in particular, by communist ideology were repealed by Law no. 3713 on the prevention of terrorism. The Court also attaches much weight to the Constitutional Court’s finding that the TBKP was not seeking, in spite of its name, to establish the domination of one social class over the others, and that, on the contrary, it satisfied the requirements of democracy, including political pluralism, universal suffrage and freedom to take part in politics (see paragraph 10 above). In that respect, the TBKP was clearly different from the German Communist Party, which was dissolved on 17 August 1956 by the German Constitutional Court (see the Commission’s decision cited above in the German Communist Party case).', 'Accordingly, in the absence of any concrete evidence to show that in choosing to call itself “communist”, the TBKP had opted for a policy that represented a real threat to Turkish society or the Turkish State, the Court cannot accept that the submission based on the party’s name may, by itself, entail the party’s dissolution.', '55. The second submission accepted by the Constitutional Court was that the TBKP sought to promote separatism and the division of the Turkish nation. By drawing a distinction in its constitution and programme between the Kurdish and Turkish nations, the TBKP had revealed its intention of working to achieve the creation of minorities which – with the exception of those referred to in the Treaty of Lausanne and the treaty with Bulgaria – posed a threat to the State’s territorial integrity. It was for that reason that self-determination and regional autonomy were both proscribed by the Constitution (see paragraph 10 above).', '56. The Court notes that although the TBKP refers in its programme (see paragraph 9 above) to the Kurdish “people” and “nation” and Kurdish “citizens”, it neither describes them as a “minority” nor makes any claim – other than for recognition of their existence – for them to enjoy special treatment or rights, still less a right to secede from the rest of the Turkish population. On the contrary, the programme states: “The TBKP will strive for a peaceful, democratic and fair solution of the Kurdish problem, so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together of their free will within the borders of the Turkish Republic, on the basis of equal rights and with a view to democratic restructuring founded on their common interests.” With regard to the right to self-determination, the TBKP does no more in its programme than deplore the fact that because of the use of violence, it was not “exercised jointly, but separately and unilaterally”, adding that “the remedy for this problem is political” and that “[i]f the oppression of the Kurdish people and discrimination against them are to end, Turks and Kurds must unite”.', 'The TBKP also said in its programme: “A solution to the Kurdish problem will only be found if the parties concerned are able to express their opinions freely, if they agree not to resort to violence in any form in order to resolve the problem and if they are able to take part in politics with their own national identity.”', '57. The Court considers one of the principal characteristics of democracy to be the possibility it offers of resolving a country’s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome. Democracy thrives on freedom of expression. From that point of view, there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State’s population and to take part in the nation’s political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned. To judge by its programme, that was indeed the TBKP ’s objective in this area. That distinguishes the present case from those referred to by the Government (see paragraph 49 above).', '58. Admittedly, it cannot be ruled out that a party’s political programme may conceal objectives and intentions different from the ones it proclaims. To verify that it does not, the content of the programme must be compared with the party’s actions and the positions it defends. In the present case, the TBKP ’s programme could hardly have been belied by any practical action it took, since it was dissolved immediately after being formed and accordingly did not even have time to take any action. It was thus penalised for conduct relating solely to the exercise of freedom of expression.', '59. The Court is also prepared to take into account the background of cases before it, in particular the difficulties associated with the fight against terrorism (see, among other authorities, the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, pp. 9 et seq., §§ 11 et seq., and the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2281 and 2284, §§ 70 and 84). In the present case, however, it finds no evidence to enable it to conclude, in the absence of any activity by the TBKP, that the party bore any responsibility for the problems which terrorism poses in Turkey.', '60. Nor is there any need to bring Article 17 into play as nothing in the constitution and programme of the TBKP warrants the conclusion that it relied on the Convention to engage in activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in it (see, mutatis mutandis, the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 1 July 1961 ( merits ), Series A no. 3, pp. 45–46, § 7).', '61. Regard being had to all the above, a measure as drastic as the immediate and permanent dissolution of the TBKP, ordered before its activities had even started and coupled with a ban barring its leaders from discharging any other political responsibility, is disproportionate to the aim pursued and consequently unnecessary in a democratic society. It follows that the measure infringed Article 11 of the Convention.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONs OF ARTICLES 9, 10, 14 AND 18 OF THE CONVENTION', '62. In their application to the Commission the applicants also complained of breaches of Articles 9, 10, 14 and 18 of the Convention. In their memorial to the Court however, they accepted the Commission’s conclusion that it was unnecessary to decide whether those provisions had been complied with in view of the finding of a violation of Article 11. The applicants did not pursue those complaints in the proceedings before the Court, which sees no reason to consider them of its own motion (see, mutatis mutandis, the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1216, § 92).', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATIONs OF ARTICLES 1 AND 3 OF PROTOCOL No. 1', '63. The applicants submitted that the effects of the TBKP ’s dissolution – its assets were confiscated and transferred to the Treasury, and its leaders were banned from taking part in elections – entailed a breach of Articles 1 and 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provide:', 'Article 1 of Protocol No. 1', '“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.', 'The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”', 'Article 3 of Protocol No. 1', '“The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”', '64. The Court notes that the measures complained of by the applicants were incidental effects of the TBKP ’s dissolution, which the Court has held to be in breach of Article 11. It is consequently unnecessary to consider these complaints separately.', 'IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION', '65. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Damage', 'The TBKP', '66. The TBKP claimed 20,000,000 French francs (FRF) for pecuniary damage “to compensate for the losses [it] sustained until the end of 1997 as a result of its dissolution and of its loss of separate legal personality, which infringed [its] right to enjoy its own property, and to receive contributions from members and supporters and public aid”. With regard to future loss, the TBKP sought payment of FRF 3,000,000 per annum to run from 1 January 1998 until the judgment of the Constitutional Court was set aside and the TBKP was recognised under domestic law and had been reconstituted.', '67. The Government stated firstly that having been dissolved by the Constitutional Court, the TBKP was unable to claim any public aid under the law on political parties. Even supposing that it had not been dissolved, it still did not satisfy the conditions laid down by that statute for a grant of aid. The TBKP ’s claims were based on fictitious grounds and were therefore unacceptable.', '68. The Delegate of the Commission invited the Court to consider carefully whether the amounts claimed were not too hypothetical to serve as a basis for the application of Article 50. If the Court decided to award a sum under that head, he questioned whether the figures put forward by the applicants were realistic.', '69. The Court notes that the claim in issue is based on an imaginary application of the provisions in the law on political parties governing the grant, subject to certain conditions, of public aid to political parties as well as on an estimation of what contributions from the TBKP ’s members and supporters would have been. The Court cannot speculate on the effect of those provisions as applied to the TBKP or on the amount of any contributions it might have received. Consequently, the claim must be dismissed, there being no causal link between the violation found and the alleged damage.', '2. Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı', '70. Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı each claimed FRF 2,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage. In support of their claims, they relied on the fact that the dissolution of the TBKP had caused them to be banned from carrying on any political activity, whether as members of the electorate or members of parliament or as founding members, managers or financial controllers of a political party.', '71. In the Government’s submission, those claims were based on the assumption that there had been a breach of all the provisions of the Convention relied upon by Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı. The Commission had, however, concluded that there had been a violation only of Article 11. The Government considered that any non-pecuniary damage would be sufficiently compensated by a finding of a violation of the Convention.', '72. The Delegate of the Commission indicated that in the event of the Court’s being minded to award a sum under this head, he doubted that the amount claimed by Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı was realistic.', '73. The Court accepts that Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı sustained non-pecuniary damage. It holds, however, that a finding of a violation of Article 11 constitutes sufficient compensation for it.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '74. The applicants sought FRF 190,000 for costs and expenses, made up of FRF 100,000 for lawyers’ fees and FRF 90,000 for all the costs of their representation before the Turkish Constitutional Court and the Convention institutions.', '75. The Government considered these to be unacceptable lump-sum claims that were both exaggerated and unreasonable.', '76. The Delegate of the Commission found them to be reasonable, provided that they represented necessarily and actually incurred costs.', '77. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and according to the criteria laid down in its case-law, the Court awards Mr Sargın and Mr Yağcı, who actually bore the costs and expenses claimed, a total sum of FRF 120,000 under this head, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment.', 'C. Default interest', '78. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.87% per annum.']",2,tr,001-58128,0

The Enichem agricoltura factory', '12. The applicants all live in the town of Manfredonia (Foggia). Approximately one kilometre away is the Enichem agricoltura company’s chemical factory, which lies within the municipality of Monte Sant’Angelo.', '13. In 1988 the factory, which produced fertilisers and caprolactam (a chemical compound producing, by a process of polycondensation, a polyamide used in the manufacture of synthetic fibres such as nylon), was classified as “high risk” according to the criteria set out in Presidential Decree no. 175 of 18 May 1988 (“ DPR 175/88”), which transposed into Italian law Directive 82/501/EEC of the Council of the European Communities (the “Seveso” directive) on the major-accident hazards of certain industrial activities dangerous to the environment and the well-being of the local population.', '14. The applicants said that in the course of its production cycle the factory released large quantities of inflammable gas – a process which could have led to explosive chemical reactions, releasing highly toxic substances – and sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide, sodium, ammonia, metal hydrides, benzoic acid and above all, arsenic trioxide. These assertions have not been disputed by the Government.', '15. Accidents due to malfunctioning have already occurred in the past, the most serious one on 26 September 1976 when the scrubbing tower for the ammonia synthesis gases exploded, allowing several tonnes of potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solution, containing arsenic trioxide, to escape. One hundred and fifty people were admitted to hospital with acute arsenic poisoning.', '16. In a report of 8 December 1988 a committee of technical experts appointed by Manfredonia District Council established that because of the factory’s geographical position, emissions from it into the atmosphere were often channelled towards Manfredonia. It was noted in the report that the factory had refused to allow the committee to carry out an inspection and that the results of a study by the factory itself showed that the emission treatment equipment was inadequate and the environmental-impact assessment incomplete.', '17. In 1989 the factory restricted its activity to the production of fertilisers, and it was accordingly still classified as a dangerous factory covered by DPR 175/88. In 1993 the Ministry for the Environment issued an order jointly with the Ministry of Health prescribing measures to be taken by the factory to improve the safety of the ongoing fertiliser production, and of caprolactam production if that was resumed (see paragraph 27 below).', '18. In 1994 the factory permanently stopped producing fertiliser. Only a thermoelectric power station and plant for the treatment of feed and waste water continued to operate.', 'B. The criminal proceedings', '1. Before the Foggia Magistrates’ Court', '19. On 13 November 1985 420 residents of Manfredonia (including the applicants) applied to the Foggia Magistrates’ Court ( pretore ) complaining that the air had been polluted by emissions of unknown chemical composition and toxicity from the factory. Criminal proceedings were brought against seven directors of the impugned company for offences relating to pollution caused by emissions from the factory and to non-compliance with a number of environmental protection regulations.', 'Judgment was given on 16 July 1991. Most of the defendants escaped a prison sentence, either because the charges were covered by an amnesty or were time-barred, or because they had paid an immediate fine ( oblazione ). Only two directors were sentenced to five months’ imprisonment and a fine of two million lire and ordered to pay damages to the civil parties, for having had waste dumps built without prior permission, contrary to the relevant provisions of DPR 915/82 on waste disposal.', '2. In the Bari Court of Appeal', '20. On appeals by the two directors who had been convicted and by the Public Electricity Company ( ENEL ) and Manfredonia District Council, which had both joined the proceedings as civil parties claiming damages, the Bari Court of Appeal acquitted the directors on 29 April 1992 on the ground that the offence had not been made out but upheld the remainder of the impugned decision. The court held that the errors which the directors were alleged to have made in the management of the waste were in fact attributable to delays and uncertainties in the adoption and interpretation, particularly by the Region of Apulia, of regulations implementing DPR 915/82. Consequently, there was no damage that gave rise to a claim for compensation.', 'C. The approach of the authorities concerned', '21. A joint committee of representatives from the State and the Region of Apulia was set up within the Italian Ministry for the Environment to implement the Seveso directive.', 'The committee ordered a technical survey, which was carried out by a panel established by an order of the Minister for the Environment of 19 June 1989. The panel had the following remit:', '(a) to report on whether the factory conformed to environmental regulations as regards discharge of waste water, treatment of liquid and solid waste, emissions of gases, and noise pollution; to report on safety aspects; and to check what authorisations had been granted to the factory to those ends;', '(b) to report on whether the factory site was compatible with its environment, having particular regard to the problems of protecting the health of the local population and the fauna and flora and of making appropriate use of the land;', '(c) to suggest what action should be taken to obtain any missing data required to complete the reports under (a) and (b) above and to identify measures to be taken to protect the environment.', '22. On 6 July 1989 the factory submitted the safety report required by Article 5 of DPR 175/88.', '23. On 24 July 1989 the panel presented its report, which was sent to the State/Regional Joint Committee. The latter published its conclusions on 6 July 1990 and fixed 30 December 1990 as the date on which the report required by Article 18 of DPR 175/88 on the risk of major accidents should be submitted to the Minister for the Environment. It also recommended:', '(a) commissioning studies of the factory’s safety and compatibility with its environment, additional analyses of disaster scenarios and of the preparation and implementation of emergency procedures;', '(b) introducing a number of changes designed to reduce the atmospheric emissions drastically and to improve the treatment of waste water, making radical alterations to the production cycles for urea and nitrogen and carrying out studies on the pollution of the subsoil and on the hydrogeological structure of the factory site. These steps were to be taken within three years. The panel also referred to the need to solve the problems of liquid combustion and the reuse of sodium salts.', 'The panel further called for a public industrial-pollution monitoring centre, to be set up by 30 December 1990, to carry out periodic checks on the factory’s practices in relation to public health and environmental protection and to act as an epidemiological observatory.', '24. On 20 June 1989 the problems relating to the operation of the factory were raised in a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment. On 7 November 1989, in the European Parliament, a question on the same point was put to the Commission of the European Communities. Replying to the latter question, the relevant Commissioner stated that (1) Enichem had sent the Italian Government the safety report requested pursuant to Article 5 of DPR 175/88; (2) on the basis of that report the Government had opened an investigation, as required by Article 18 of DPR 175/88 to check safety at the factory and, if appropriate, to identify any further safety measures needed; and (3) so far as the application of the Seveso directive was concerned, the Government had taken the requisite measures with regard to the factory.', 'D. Steps taken to inform the local population', '25. Articles 11 and 17 of DPR 175/88 require the relevant mayor and prefect to inform local inhabitants of the hazards of the industrial activity concerned, the safety measures taken, the plans made for emergencies and the procedure to be followed in the event of an accident.', '26. On 2 October 1992 the Coordinating Committee for Industrial Safety Measures gave its opinion on the emergency plan that had been drawn up by the prefect of Foggia, in accordance with Article 17 § 1 of DPR 175/88. On 3 August 1993 the plan was sent to the relevant committee of the Civil Defence Department. In a letter of 12 August 1993 the under-secretary of the Civil Defence Department assured the prefect of Foggia that the plan would be submitted promptly to the Coordinating Committee for its opinion and expressed the hope that it could be put into effect as quickly as possible, given the sensitive issues raised by planning for emergencies.', '27. On 14 September 1993 the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Health jointly adopted conclusions on the factory’s safety report of July 1989, as required by Article 19 of DPR 175/88. Those conclusions prescribed a number of improvements to be made to the installations, both in relation to fertiliser production and in the event of resumed caprolactam production (see paragraph 17 above) and provided the prefect with instructions as to the emergency plan for which he was responsible and the measures required for informing the local population under Article 17 of DPR 175/88.', 'In a letter of 7 December 1995 to the European Commission of Human Rights, however, the mayor of Monte Sant’Angelo indicated that the investigation for the purpose of drawing up conclusions under Article 19 was still continuing and that he had not received any documents relating to them. He pointed out that the District Council was still awaiting direction from the Civil Defence Department before deciding what safety measures should be taken and what procedures should be followed in the event of an accident and communicated to the public. He said that if the factory resumed production, the measures for informing the public would be taken as soon as the conclusions based on the investigation were available.', 'III. work by the Council of Europe', '34. Of particular relevance among the various Council of Europe documents in the field under consideration in the present case is Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1087 (1996) on the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, which was adopted on 26 April 1996 (at the 16th Sitting). Referring not only to the risks associated with the production and use of nuclear energy in the civil sector but also to other matters, it states “public access to clear and full information ... must be viewed as a basic human right”.']","['II. Relevant domestic law', '28. As regards the obligation to inform the public on matters of environmental and public safety, Article 5 of DPR 175/88 provides that any undertaking carrying on dangerous activities must submit a report to the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Health giving details of, among other things, its activities, emergency procedures in the event of a major accident, the persons responsible for carrying these procedures out, and the measures taken by the undertaking to reduce the risks to the environment and public health. Article 21 of DPR 175/88 provides that anyone in charge of an undertaking who fails to submit the report required by Article 5 may be sentenced to up to one year’s imprisonment.', '29. At the material time Article 11 § 3 of DPR 175/88 provided that mayors were under a duty to inform the public of', '(a) the nature of the production process;', '(b) the nature and quantities of the substances involved;', '(c) the potential risks to employees and workers in the factory, members of the public and the environment;', '(d) the conclusions on the safety reports submitted by the factory pursuant to Article 5 and on any additional measures referred to in Article 19; and', '(e) the safety measures and procedures to be followed in the event of an accident.', 'Article 11 § 2 provided that, in order to protect industrial secrets, any person responsible for examining reports or information from the undertakings concerned was forbidden to disclose any information that he had thereby obtained.', '30. Article 11 § 1 provided that data and information on industrial activities obtained pursuant to DPR 175/88 could be used only for the purposes for which they had been requested.', 'That provision was partly amended by Legislative Decree no. 461 of 8 November 1995. Paragraph 2 of that decree provides for an exception to the ban on disclosure of industrial secrets in the case of certain information, namely that contained in an information sheet which the undertaking must complete and send to the Ministry for the Environment and the regional or inter-regional technical committee. Mayors’ duties with regard to informing the public are unchanged and now appear in paragraph 4.', '31. Article 17 of DPR 175/88 also lays certain obligations on the prefect in the matter of providing information. In particular, paragraph 1 of that provision (now paragraph 1 bis ) requires the prefect to draw up an emergency plan based on the information supplied by the factory and the Coordinating Committee for Industrial Safety Measures. That plan must be sent to the Ministry of the Interior and the Civil Defence Department. Paragraph 2 goes on to provide that, after drawing up the emergency plan, the prefect must adequately inform the population concerned of the hazards of the activities, the safety measures taken to prevent a major accident, the emergency procedures planned for the area outside the factory should a major accident occur and the procedures to be followed in the event of an accident. The amendments made to this Article in the aforementioned legislative decree include a new paragraph 1, to the effect that the Civil Defence Department must establish reference criteria for emergency planning and the adoption of measures for the supply of information to the public by the prefect, and repeal of paragraph 3, which provided that the information referred to in paragraph 2 had to be sent to the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Health and the regional authorities concerned.', '32. Section 14(3) of Law no. 349 of 8 July 1986, by which the Ministry for the Environment in Italy was created and the first legal provisions on environmental damage introduced, provides that everyone has a right of access to the information on the state of the environment which is, in accordance with the law, available at the offices of the administrative authorities and may obtain a copy on defrayment of the authorities’ costs.', '33. In a judgment (no. 476) of 21 November 1991 the Council of Administrative Law for Sicily ( Consiglio di Giustizia amministrativa per la Regione siciliana – which in Sicily replaces the Supreme Administrative Court) held that the concept of “information on the state of the environment” included any information about human beings’ physical surroundings and concerning matters of some interest to the community. On the basis of those criteria, the Council of Administrative Law held that a district council was not justified in refusing to allow a private individual to obtain a copy of analyses of the fitness of water in the district in question for use as drinking water.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '35. The applicants applied to the Commission on 18 October 1988. Relying on Article 2 of the Convention, they submitted that the lack of practical measures, in particular to reduce pollution levels and major-accident hazards arising out of the factory’s operation, infringed their right to respect for their lives and physical integrity. They also complained that the relevant authorities’ failure to inform the public about the hazards and about the procedures to be followed in the event of a major accident, as required in particular by Article 11 § 3 and Article 17 § 2 of Presidential Decree no. 175/88, infringed their right to freedom of information as guaranteed by Article 10.', '36. On 6 July 1995 the Commission declared the application (no. 14967/89) admissible as to the complaint under Article 10 and inadmissible as to the remainder. In its report of 29 June 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion by twenty-one votes to eight that there had been a breach of that Article. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '37. The Government concluded their memorial by inviting the Court, as their primary submission, to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and, in the alternative, to hold that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', '38. At the hearing the applicants’ counsel asked the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Articles 10, 8 and 2 of the Convention and to award her clients just satisfaction.', 'as to the law', 'I. scope of the case', '39. Before the Commission the applicants made two complaints. Firstly, the authorities had not taken appropriate action to reduce the risk of pollution by the Enichem agricoltura chemical factory at Manfredonia (“the factory”) and to avoid the risk of major accidents; that situation, they asserted, infringed their right to life and physical integrity as guaranteed by Article 2 of the Convention. Secondly, the Italian State had failed to take steps to provide information about the risks and how to proceed in the event of a major accident, as they were required to do by Articles 11 § 3 and 17 § 2 of Presidential Decree no. 175/88 (“ DPR 175/88”); as a result the applicants considered that there had been a breach of their right to freedom of information laid down in Article 10 of the Convention.', '40. On 6 July 1995 the Commission, by a majority vote, upheld the Government’s preliminary objection that domestic remedies had not been exhausted in respect of the first issue and declared the remainder of the application admissible, “without prejudging the merits”.', 'In its report of 25 June 1996 it considered the case under Article 10 of the Convention and decided that that provision was applicable and had been breached since, at least during the period between the issue of DPR 175/88 in May 1988 and the cessation of fertiliser production in 1994, the relevant authorities were under an obligation to take the necessary steps so that the applicants, who were living in a high-risk area, could “receive adequate information on issues concerning the protection of their environment”. Eight members of the Commission expressed their disagreement in three dissenting opinions, two of which pointed to the possibility of a different approach to the case, on the basis that Article 8 of the Convention was applicable to the complaint declared admissible.', '41. In their memorial to the Court and at the hearing the applicants relied also on Articles 8 and 2 of the Convention, contending that the failure to provide them with the relevant information had infringed their right to respect for their private and family life and their right to life.', '42. Before the Court the Delegate of the Commission merely reiterated the conclusion set out in the report (that there had been a violation of Article 10), whereas the Government argued that the complaints under Articles 8 and 2 fell outside the compass of the case as delimited by the decision on admissibility.', 'It is therefore necessary to determine as a preliminary issue the extent of the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae.', '43. The Court observes, firstly, that its jurisdiction “extend[s] to all cases concerning the interpretation and application of [the] Convention which are referred to it in accordance with Article 48” (see Article 45 of the Convention as amended in respect of States which have ratified Protocol No. 9) and that “In the event of dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter [is] settled by the decision of the Court” (Article 49).', '44. Secondly, it reiterates that since the Court is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, it does not consider itself bound by the characterisation given by an applicant, a government or the Commission. By virtue of the jura novit curia principle, it has, for example, considered of its own motion complaints under Articles or paragraphs not relied on by those appearing before it and even under a provision in respect of which the Commission had declared the complaint to be inadmissible while declaring it admissible under a different one. A complaint is characterised by the facts alleged in it and not merely by the legal grounds or arguments relied on (see the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, § 29).', 'The Court has full jurisdiction only within the scope of the “case”, which is determined by the decision on the admissibility of the application. Within the compass thus delimited, the Court may deal with any issue of fact or law that arises during the proceedings before it (see, among many other authorities, the Philis v. Greece judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 19, § 56).', '45. In the instant case the grounds based on Articles 8 and 2 were not expressly set out in the application or the applicants’ initial memorials lodged in the proceedings before the Commission. Clearly, however, those grounds were closely connected with the one pleaded, namely that giving information to the applicants, all of whom lived barely a kilometre from the factory, could have had a bearing on their private and family life and their physical integrity.', '46. Having regard to the foregoing and to the Commission’s decision on admissibility, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction to consider the case under Articles 8 and 2 of the Convention as well as under Article 10.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION', '47. The applicants alleged that they were the victims of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The alleged breach resulted from the authorities’ failure to take steps to ensure that the public were informed of the risks and of what was to be done in the event of an accident connected with the factory’s operation.', 'A. The Government’s preliminary objection', '48. As they had done before the Commission, the Government raised a preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies, to which there were two limbs.', 'In the first limb the Government argued that it was possible to make an urgent application under Article 700 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the applicants had feared imminent danger in connection with the operation of the factory, they could and should have sought a court order affording them instant protection of their rights. The Government acknowledged their failure to provide examples of similar cases in which Article 700 had been applied, but said that, regardless of whether that provision could be used against a public body, it could certainly be used against a factory which, as in the present case, had not produced a safety report as required by Article 5 of DPR 175/88 (see paragraph 28 above).', 'The second limb concerned the fact that the applicants had not complained to a criminal court about the lack of relevant information from, in particular, the factory, whereas such omissions constituted an offence under Article 21 of DPR 175/88.', '49. The Court considers that neither remedy would have enabled the applicants to achieve their aim.', 'Even though the Government were unable to prove that an urgent application would have been effective as environmental cases had still not given rise to any authoritative judicial decision in the relevant area, Article 700 of the Code of Civil Procedure would have been a practicable remedy if the applicants’ complaint had concerned a failure to take measures designed to reduce or eliminate pollution; indeed, that was the Commission’s conclusion when it ruled on the admissibility of the application (see paragraph 40 above). In reality, the complaint in the instant case was that information about the risks and about what to do in the event of an accident had not been provided, whereas an urgent application would probably have resulted in the factory’s operation being suspended.', 'As to instituting criminal proceedings, the safety report was submitted by the factory on 6 July 1989 (see paragraph 22 above) and if the applicants had lodged a criminal complaint they would at most have secured the conviction of the factory’s managers, but certainly not the communication of any information.', 'The objection must therefore be dismissed.', 'B. Merits of the complaint', '50. It remains to be determined whether Article 10 of the Convention is applicable and, if so, whether it has been infringed.', '51. In the Government’s submission, that provision merely guaranteed freedom to receive information without hindrance by States; it did not impose any positive obligation. That was shown by the fact that Resolution 1087 (1996) of the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly and Directive 90/313/EEC of the Council of the European Communities on freedom of access to information on the environment spoke merely of access, not a right, to information. If a positive obligation to provide information existed, it would be “extremely difficult to implement” because of the need to determine how and when the information was to be disclosed, which authorities were responsible for disclosing it and who was to receive it.', '52. Like the applicants, the Commission was of the opinion that the provision of information to the public was now one of the essential means of protecting the well-being and health of the local population in situations in which the environment was at risk. Consequently, the words “This right shall include freedom ... to receive … information...” in paragraph 1 of Article 10 had to be construed as conferring an actual right to receive information, in particular from the relevant authorities, on members of local populations who had been or might be affected by an industrial or other activity representing a threat to the environment.', 'Article 10 imposed on States not just a duty to make available information to the public on environmental matters, a requirement with which Italian law already appeared to comply, by virtue of section 14(3) of Law no. 349 in particular, but also a positive obligation to collect, process and disseminate such information, which by its nature could not otherwise come to the knowledge of the public. The protection afforded by Article 10 therefore had a preventive function with respect to potential violations of the Convention in the event of serious damage to the environment and Article 10 came into play even before any direct infringement of other fundamental rights, such as the right to life or to respect for private and family life, occurred.', '53. The Court does not subscribe to that view. In cases concerning restrictions on freedom of the press it has on a number of occasions recognised that the public has a right to receive information as a corollary of the specific function of journalists, which is to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest (see, among other authorities, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, § 59 (b), and the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63). The facts of the present case are, however, clearly distinguishable from those of the aforementioned cases since the applicants complained of a failure in the system set up pursuant to DPR 175/88, which had transposed into Italian law Directive 82/501/EEC of the Council of the European Communities (the “Seveso” directive) on the major-accident hazards of certain industrial activities dangerous to the environment and the well-being of the local population. Although the prefect of Foggia prepared the emergency plan on the basis of the report submitted by the factory and the plan was sent to the Civil Defence Department on 3 August 1993, the applicants have yet to receive the relevant information (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above).', 'The Court reiterates that freedom to receive information, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, “basically prohibits a government from restricting a person from receiving information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him” (see the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 29, § 74). That freedom cannot be construed as imposing on a State, in circumstances such as those of the present case, positive obligations to collect and disseminate information of its own motion.', '54. In conclusion, Article 10 is not applicable in the instant case.', '55. In the light of what was said in paragraph 45 above, the case falls to be considered under Article 8 of the Convention.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION', '56. The applicants, relying on the same facts, maintained before the Court that they had been the victims of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', '57. The Court’s task is to determine whether Article 8 is applicable and, if so, whether it has been infringed.', 'The Court notes, firstly, that all the applicants live at Manfredonia, approximately a kilometre away from the factory, which, owing to its production of fertilisers and caprolactam, was classified as being high-risk in 1988, pursuant to the criteria laid down in DPR 175/88.', 'In the course of its production cycle the factory released large quantities of inflammable gas and other toxic substances, including arsenic trioxide. Moreover, in 1976, following the explosion of the scrubbing tower for the ammonia synthesis gases, several tonnes of potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solution, containing arsenic trioxide, escaped and 150 people had to be hospitalised on account of acute arsenic poisoning.', 'In addition, in its report of 8 December 1988, a committee of technical experts appointed by the Manfredonia District Council said in particular that because of the factory’s geographical position, emissions from it into the atmosphere were often channelled towards Manfredonia (see paragraphs 14–16 above).', 'The direct effect of the toxic emissions on the applicants’ right to respect for their private and family life means that Article 8 is applicable.', '58. The Court considers that Italy cannot be said to have “interfered” with the applicants’ private or family life; they complained not of an act by the State but of its failure to act. However, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 17, § 32).', 'In the present case it need only be ascertained whether the national authorities took the necessary steps to ensure effective protection of the applicants’ right to respect for their private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see the Lόpez Ostra v. Spain judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C, p. 55, § 55).', '59. On 14 September 1993, pursuant to Article 19 of DPR 175/88, the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Health jointly adopted conclusions on the safety report submitted by the factory in July 1989. Those conclusions prescribed improvements to be made to the installations, both in relation to current fertiliser production and in the event of resumed caprolactam production, and provided the prefect with instructions as to the emergency plan – that he had drawn up in 1992 – and the measures required for informing the local population under Article 17 of DPR 175/88.', 'In a letter of 7 December 1995 to the European Commission of Human Rights, however, the mayor of Monte Sant’Angelo indicated that the investigation for the purpose of drawing up conclusions under Article 19 was still continuing and that he had not received any documents relating to them. He pointed out that the District Council was still awaiting direction from the Civil Defence Department before deciding what safety measures should be taken and what procedures should be followed in the event of an accident and communicated to the public. He said that if the factory resumed production, the measures for informing the public would be taken as soon as the conclusions based on the investigation were available (see paragraph 27 above).', '60. The Court reiterates that severe environmental pollution may affect individuals’ well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely (see, mutatis mutandis, the Lόpez Ostra judgment cited above, p. 54, § 51). In the instant case the applicants waited, right up until the production of fertilisers ceased in 1994, for essential information that would have enabled them to assess the risks they and their families might run if they continued to live at Manfredonia, a town particularly exposed to danger in the event of an accident at the factory.', 'The Court holds, therefore, that the respondent State did not fulfil its obligation to secure the applicants’ right to respect for their private and family life, in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.', 'There has consequently been a violation of that provision.', 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION', '61. Referring to the fact that workers from the factory had died of cancer, the applicants also argued that the failure to provide the information in issue had infringed their right to life as guaranteed by Article 2 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.', '2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:', '(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;', '(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;', '(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”', '62. Having regard to its conclusion that there has been a violation of Article 8, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider the case under Article 2 also.', 'V. application of article 50 of the convention', '63. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Damage', '64. The applicants sought compensation for “biological” damage; they claimed 20,000,000,000 Italian lire (ITL).', '65. In the Government’s submission, the applicants had not shown that they had sustained any damage and had not even described it in detail. If the Court were to hold that there had been non-pecuniary damage, a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction for it.', '66. The Delegate of the Commission invited the Court to award the applicants compensation that was adequate and proportionate to the considerable damage they had suffered. He suggested a sum of ITL 100,000,000 for each applicant.', '67. The Court considers that the applicants did not show that they had sustained any pecuniary damage as a result of the lack of information of which they complained. As to the rest, it holds that the applicants undoubtedly suffered non-pecuniary damage and awards them ITL 10,000,000 each.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '68. The applicants were granted legal aid for the proceedings before the Court in the amount of 16,304 French francs; however, at the end of the hearing their counsel lodged an application with the registry for an additional sum in respect of her fees.', '69. Neither the Government nor the Delegate of the Commission expressed a view on the matter.', '70. Having regard to the amount already granted in legal aid and the lateness of the application (see Rules 39 § 1 and 52 § 1 of Rules of Court B), the Court dismisses the claim.', 'C. Other claims', '71. Lastly, the applicants sought an order from the Court requiring the respondent State to decontaminate the entire industrial estate concerned, to carry out an epidemiological study of the area and the local population and to undertake an inquiry to identify the possible serious effects on residents most exposed to substances believed to be carcinogenic.', '72. The Government submitted that those claims were inadmissible.', '73. The Delegate of the Commission expressed the view that a thorough and efficient inquiry by the national authorities together with the publication and communication to the applicants of a full, accurate report on all the relevant aspects of the factory’s operation over the period in question, including the harm actually caused to the environment and people’s health, in addition to the payment of just satisfaction, would meet the obligation laid down in Article 53 of the Convention.', '74. The Court notes that the Convention does not empower it to accede to such a request. It reiterates that it is for the State to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal system in order to comply with the provisions of the Convention or to redress the situation that has given rise to the violation of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Zanghì v. Italy of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 194-C, p. 48, § 26, Demicoli v. Malta of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, p. 19, § 45, and Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 24, § 81).', 'D. Default interest', '75. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Italy at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 5% per annum.']",2,it,001-58135,0

She is the executive director of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (“SPUC”), an organisation of approximately 50,000 members which is opposed to abortion and human embryo experimentation and seeks changes to the present United Kingdom law which permits abortion up to twenty-two weeks and embryo experimentation up to fourteen days.', '11. The major political parties have no policies with regard to abortion and embryo experimentation: these are regarded as moral issues and members of Parliament are allowed to vote on proposed legislation according to their consciences. Mrs Bowman and SPUC therefore took the view that, if electors were to be in a position to bring about changes to the law through their choice of representative, it was important for them to be informed of the opinions of candidates standing for election with regard to abortion and related issues.', '12. In the period immediately before the parliamentary elections in April 1992, Mrs Bowman therefore arranged to have some one and a half million leaflets distributed in constituencies throughout the United Kingdom, including, in the constituency of Halifax, 25,000 copies of a leaflet which read as follows:', '“We are not telling you how to vote, but it is essential for you to check on Candidates’ voting intentions on abortion and on the use of the human embryo as a guinea-pig.', 'Terry Martin, Conservative. Mr Martin has publicly declared his firm commitment to defending the unborn child. If elected, he would vote to tighten the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to stop abortion after 24 weeks, as the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. Would vote to stop the creation and use of human embryos as guinea-pigs for drug testing.', 'Alison Mahon, Labour. Mrs Mahon is a leading pro-abortionist. As an MP she voted to allow abortion up to birth for handicapped babies. She voted for the compulsory enrolment on a published register of doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion despite warnings that it could be used as a blacklist. She also voted to allow human embryos to be used as guinea-pigs in programmes including the testing of drugs and other experiments.', 'Ian Howell, Liberal Democrat. If elected, Mr Howell would vote for the tightening of the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to reduce the time-limit to 24 weeks or less, where the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. He would vote to protect human embryos from being used as guinea ‑ pigs in research programmes.', 'THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE UNBORN CHILD”', 'On the reverse side of the leaflet, together with a picture marked “an unborn baby ten weeks after conception”, was printed:', '“The First Weeks of Life Day 1: Conception – sperm and ovum meet in fertilisation. Genetic make-up complete. Colour of eyes, hair, sex and even build determined. A unique individual is present in the womb’s fallopian tube. Day 12: Has travelled to the womb and implanted there. Day 17: Development of own blood cells. Day 21: Heart starts to beat. This is at least as dramatic as birth, but far less dramatic than fertilisation. Day 26: Foundation of central nervous system established. Day 30: Regular blood flow within closed vascular system. Ears and nose start to develop. Day 42: Skeleton and reflexes present. Liver, kidneys and lungs formed. Responds to touch around the mouth. Day 45: Electrical brainwave patterns can be recorded. Day 56: All organs functioning except the lungs; the baby only has to grow and mature now, just as a child grows into an adult. Day 65: The baby can make a fist and will grasp an object stroking his palm; leaps up and down in the womb with movements co-ordinated. Week 12: Entire surface of the body sensitive to touch. Week 16: Baby is half birth length; the heart pumps 50 pints of blood daily. Week 28: Eyes open. Baby can hear mother’s digestive processes, heartbeat and her voice, as well as sounds outside her body. 9th Month: Birth – just another stage in an already well-advanced process. From the above it is clear that the baby can feel pain at a very early stage. We are, therefore, destroying babies painfully up to 6 months after conception, and in some cases, such as handicap, up to birth.”', '13. Mrs Bowman was charged with an offence under subsections 75(1) and (5) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”), which prohibits expenditure of more than five pounds sterling (“GBP”) by an unauthorised person during the period before an election on conveying information to electors with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate (see paragraphs 17–19 below).', '14. At Mrs Bowman’s trial at Southwark Crown Court on 27 September 1993, the judge directed her acquittal, because the summons charging her with the offence had not been issued within one year of the alleged prohibited expenditure, in accordance with the time-limit stipulated in section 176 of the 1983 Act. The proceedings were, nonetheless, reported in the press.', '15. In 1979, Mrs Bowman had been convicted of an offence under similar legislation in respect of a leaflet distributed prior to the Ilford North by-election and in 1982 she had also been convicted in respect of a leaflet distributed during the elections for the European Parliament. On both occasions she was ordered to pay a fine and the prosecution costs.']","['II. Relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. Parliamentary elections', '16. The date of a general election is chosen by the incumbent Prime Minister and is normally announced between four and six weeks before polling day.', '17. For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies. Each constituency is represented by a single member of Parliament, the person who received the greatest number of votes in his or her constituency. Most candidates are selected by the main, national political parties, although some stand as independent. A candidate’s nomination for election must be signed by ten people registered to vote in the constituency. Each candidate must deposit GBP 500 with the constituency returning officer. If he or she does not receive at least 5% of the votes validly cast, this deposit will be forfeited.', 'B. Control of election expenditure', '18. Parliamentary candidates in the United Kingdom receive no State funding for their campaigns. To safeguard the position of candidates without access to substantial resources, the amount of expenses which may be incurred by a candidate before, during or after an electoral campaign is controlled by statute (1983 Act, section 76). The amount varies slightly depending on the size of the constituency, but the average is currently GBP 8,300. To ensure that this limit is not circumvented, all election expenditure by a candidate must go through an election agent, who is required to submit an account after the election (1983 Act, sections 73, 76 and 81).', '19. Under section 75(1) of the 1983 Act, any expenditure incurred to promote the election of a candidate by any person other than the candidate or his or her agent is prohibited:', '“No expenses shall, with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate at an election, be incurred by any person other than the candidate, his election agent and persons authorised in writing by the election agent on account – (a) of holding public meetings or organising any public display; or (b) of issuing advertisements, circulars or publications; or (c) of otherwise presenting to the electors the candidate or his views or the extent or nature of his backing or disparaging another candidate, but paragraph (c) of this subsection shall not – (i) restrict the publication of any matter relating to the election in a newspaper or other periodical or in a broadcast made by the British Broadcasting Corporation ... [or the Independent Broadcasting Authority]; (ii) apply to any expenses not exceeding in aggregate the sum of GBP 5.”', 'The words “with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate” in this subsection have been interpreted by the House of Lords to include the intention to prevent the election of a particular candidate or candidates ( Director of Public Prosecutions v. Luft [1977] Appeal Cases 962).', '20. Mrs Bowman was charged with an offence under section 75(5) of the 1983 Act, which provides:', '“If a person – (a) incurs, or aids, abets, counsels or procures any other person to incur, any expenses in contravention of [section 75] ... he shall be guilty of a corrupt practice...”', '21. The maximum penalty for offences tried on indictment under subsections 75(1) and (5) is one year’s imprisonment and/or a fine up to GBP 5,000. In addition, a person convicted may be disqualified for up to five years from voting in elections, being elected to or sitting in the House of Commons or holding any judicial or public office (1983 Act, sections 160(4), 168(1) and 173).', '22. Section 75 is concerned only with expenditure incurred in relation to the election of a particular candidate in a particular constituency. There is nothing to prohibit a political party or wealthy individual or organisation from spending money on publicity in support or opposition to a political party or tendency generally, at national or regional level, provided that there is no intention to promote or prejudice the electoral chances of any particular candidate in any particular constituency (see R. v. Tronoh Mines [1952] 1 All England Reports 697). Nor are there any restrictions on private donations to political parties or on the powers of the press to support or oppose the election of any particular candidate (see 1983 Act, section 75(1)(c)(i) – paragraph 19 above).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '23. The application to the Commission of 11 March 1994 (no. 24839/94) was brought jointly by Mrs Bowman and SPUC. Both applicants complained that the prosecution brought against Mrs Bowman violated their rights to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. They also invoked Article 13 of the Convention.', '24. On 4 December 1995 the Commission declared the application admissible in so far as it concerned the complaint by Mrs Bowman under Article 10. However, finding that SPUC could not itself claim to be a victim by virtue of Mrs Bowman’s prosecution, it declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.', 'In its report of 12 September 1996 (Article 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (twenty-eight votes to one). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'final submissions to the court', '25. In their memorial and at the hearing before the Court, the Government submitted that, contrary to the opinion of the Commission, the application should be declared inadmissible under Article 25 of the Convention. In the alternative, they submitted that there had been no restriction on the applicant’s freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 § 1 and that, even if there had been, it was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of Article 10 § 2.', 'The applicant asked the Court to find a violation of Article 10 and to award her just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'as to the law', 'i. the government’s preliminary objection', '26. The Government contended that Mrs Bowman could not properly claim to be a “victim” of a violation of the Convention within the meaning of Article 25 § 1 which provides, as relevant:', '“The Commission may receive petitions … from any person … claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in [the] Convention…”', 'They pointed to the fact that the trial judge had directed the jury on 28 September 1993 to acquit the applicant, and submitted that in these circumstances it was impossible to say that she would have been convicted had the trial continued or that the law was applied to her detriment.', '27. The applicant submitted that, as a result of the application to her of section 75 of the 1983 Act, she had suffered the anxiety, stigma and expense involved in her interrogation by the police, the prosecution against her and the surrounding publicity.', '28. The Commission in its decision on admissibility was satisfied that Mrs Bowman had been directly affected by the prosecution instituted against her, and could therefore claim to be the victim of an interference.', '29. The Court observes that a measure of implementation, namely a prosecution, was brought against Mrs Bowman. Although she was eventually acquitted, this was for the technical reason that the summons had not been issued within the statutory time-limit (see paragraph 14 above). The fact that the prosecuting authorities decided to commence proceedings against the applicant was, at the very least, a strong indication to her that, unless she modified her behaviour during future elections, she would run the risk of being prosecuted again and possibly convicted and punished.', 'In these circumstances, the Court considers that Mrs Bowman could properly claim to have been directly affected by the law in question (see, among other authorities, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, p. 16, § 31) and, therefore, to be the victim of a violation of the Convention within the meaning of Article 25 § 1.', 'The Government’s preliminary objection is accordingly dismissed.', 'ii. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '30. Mrs Bowman alleged a violation of her right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, which states, as relevant:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers…', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Commission agreed that there had been a violation, but the Government disputed this.', 'A. Existence of a restriction', '31. The Government submitted that there had been no restriction of Mrs Bowman’s right to freedom of expression, since section 75 of the 1983 Act restricted only the freedom of unauthorised persons to incur expenditure with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a particular candidate in a parliamentary election, but not their freedom to express opinions or disseminate information more generally (see paragraph 19 above).', '32. The Commission, like the applicant, observed that the fact that the prosecuting authorities obviously regarded her conduct as falling within the statutory prohibition caused, through the fear of prosecution, a restriction on her freedom of expression.', '33. The Court notes that section 75 of the 1983 Act does not directly restrain freedom of expression, but instead limits to GBP 5 the amount of money which unauthorised persons are permitted to spend on publications and other means of communication during the election period. Moreover, it does not restrict expenditure on the transmission of information or opinions in general, but only that incurred during the relevant period “with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate”.', 'Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that the prohibition contained in section 75 amounted to a restriction on freedom of expression, which directly affected Mrs Bowman (see paragraph 29 above).', '34. It remains to be considered whether this restriction was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society”.', 'B. “Prescribed by law”', '35. The Court considers, and indeed this was not disputed before it, that the restriction on expenditure provided for by section 75 of the 1983 Act was “prescribed by law”.', 'C. Legitimate aim', '36. The Government maintained that the spending limit in section 75 of the 1983 Act pursued the aim of protecting the rights of others in three ways. First, it promoted fairness between competing candidates for election by preventing wealthy third parties from campaigning for or against a particular candidate or issuing material which necessitated the devotion of part of a candidate’s election budget, which was limited by law (see paragraph 18 above), to a response. Secondly, the restriction on third-party expenditure helped to ensure that candidates remained independent of the influence of powerful interest groups. Thirdly, it prevented the political debate at election times from being distorted by having the discussion shifted away from matters of general concern to centre on single issues.', '37. In the applicant’s view, section 75, far from pursuing a legitimate aim, only operated to curtail democratic freedom of expression. It was improbable in the extreme that single-issue groups, such as SPUC, could distract voters from the mainstream political platforms to such a degree as to hinder the electoral process. Furthermore, the restriction on expenditure could not properly be said to ensure equality between candidates, because they were already subject to inequalities depending on whether or not they received the support of one of the major political parties, which were free to spend unlimited amounts on campaigning at national level as long as they did not attempt to promote or prejudice any particular candidate (see paragraph 22 above).', '38. The Court finds it clear that the purpose of section 75, particularly taken in the context of the other detailed provisions on election expenditure in the 1983 Act, is to contribute towards securing equality between candidates. It therefore concludes, as did the Commission, that the application of this law to Mrs Bowman pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others, namely the candidates for election and the electorate in Halifax and, to the extent that the prosecution was intended to have a deterrent effect, elsewhere in the United Kingdom.', 'It considers that the arguments advanced by the applicant on this point are of greater relevance to the issue whether the restriction was “necessary in a democratic society”, to which question it now turns.', 'D. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '39. The Government maintained that section 75 of the 1983 Act imposed only a partial restriction on expenditure (see paragraph 31 above), which was no more extensive than was necessary to achieve the legitimate aims pursued. They pointed out that there had been other means of communication open to Mrs Bowman, for example, she could have started her own newspaper, had letters or articles published in the press, given interviews on radio or television, stood for election herself or published leaflets with the purpose of informing the electorate without promoting or opposing any particular candidate.', '40. The applicant, as did the Commission, considered that the restriction was disproportionate. She contended that there was no pressing social need to suppress the dissemination of factually accurate information about the position of candidates for public office on important moral issues; on the contrary, there was a pressing need to permit such matters to be put on the political agenda prior to elections. Despite the Government’s submission that the restriction was necessary to ensure equality between candidates, there was no indication that Mrs Bowman’s leaflets had operated to disadvantage any particular candidate, since it was possible that the information they contained attracted as many supporters as opponents of the different policies on abortion. Furthermore, she asserted that the restriction was illogical since no limit was placed on the powers of the mass media to publish material in support of or opposition to candidates or on the political parties and their supporters to pay for advertising at national or regional levels as long as they did not attempt to promote or prejudice the electoral prospects of any particular candidate.', '41. The Court observes, in the first place, that the limitation on expenditure prescribed by section 75 of the 1983 Act is only one of the many detailed checks and balances which make up United Kingdom electoral law. In such a context, it is necessary to consider the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 in the light of the right to free elections protected by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which provides:', '“The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”', '42. Free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system (see the Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113, p. 22, § 47, and the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, §§ 41–42). The two rights are inter-related and operate to reinforce each other: for example, as the Court has observed in the past, freedom of expression is one of the “conditions” necessary to “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see the above-mentioned Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt judgment, p. 24, § 54). For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely.', '43. Nonetheless, in certain circumstances the two rights may come into conflict and it may be considered necessary, in the period preceding or during an election, to place certain restrictions, of a type which would not usually be acceptable, on freedom of expression, in order to secure the “free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”. The Court recognises that, in striking the balance between these two rights, the Contracting States have a margin of appreciation, as they do generally with regard to the organisation of their electoral systems (see the above-mentioned Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt judgment, pp. 23 and 24, §§ 52 and 54).', '44. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court’s task is to determine whether, in all the circumstances, the restriction on Mrs Bowman’s freedom of expression was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities in justification of it were relevant and sufficient (see the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, p. 26, § 40).', '45. In this connection it finds it significant that the limitation on expenditure contained in section 75 of the 1983 Act was set as low as GBP 5. It recalls that this restriction applied only during the four to six weeks preceding the general election (see paragraphs 16 and 18–19 above). However, although it is true that Mrs Bowman could have campaigned freely at any other time, this would not, in the Court’s view, have served her purpose in publishing the leaflets which was, at the very least, to inform the people of Halifax about the three candidates’ voting records and attitudes on abortion, during the critical period when their minds were focused on their choice of representative (see paragraph 11 above).', '46. The Court notes the Government’s submission that the applicant could have made use of alternative methods to convey the information to the electorate. However, it is not satisfied that, in practice, she had access to any other effective channels of communication. For example, it has not been demonstrated that she had any way of ensuring that the material contained in the leaflets was published in a newspaper or broadcast on radio or television. Although she could herself have stood for election and thus become entitled to incur the statutory amount of expenses allowed to candidates, this would have required her to pay a deposit of GBP 500, which she would in all probability have forfeited (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Furthermore, it was not her desire to be elected to Parliament, but only to distribute leaflets to voters.', '47. In summary, therefore, the Court finds that section 75 of the 1983 Act operated, for all practical purposes, as a total barrier to Mrs Bowman’s publishing information with a view to influencing the voters of Halifax in favour of an anti-abortion candidate. It is not satisfied that it was necessary thus to limit her expenditure to GBP 5 in order to achieve the legitimate aim of securing equality between candidates, particularly in view of the fact that there were no restrictions placed upon the freedom of the press to support or oppose the election of any particular candidate or upon political parties and their supporters to advertise at national or regional level, provided that such advertisements were not intended to promote or prejudice the electoral prospects of any particular candidate in any particular constituency (see paragraph 22 above). It accordingly concludes that the restriction in question was disproportionate to the aim pursued.', 'It follows that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'iii. application of article 50 of the convention', '48. The applicant claimed just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '49. Mrs Bowman sought compensation of GBP 15,000 for the stigma, stress and anxiety she had suffered as a result of being prosecuted.', '50. The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would be an adequate remedy.', '51. The Court considers that, in all the circumstances of the case, the finding of a violation is sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.', 'B. Legal costs and expenses', '1. Domestic proceedings', '52. Mrs Bowman claimed repayment of the shortfall of her domestic legal costs which had not been covered by legal aid, in total GBP 1,633.64.', '53. The Government submitted that no domestic legal costs should be awarded.', '54. The Court is satisfied that the costs in question were necessarily incurred by the applicant in the domestic proceedings and were reasonable as to quantum (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 38, p. 13, § 23). It therefore awards them in total, together with any value-added tax (VAT) which may be payable in respect of them.', '2. Strasbourg proceedings', '55. The applicant requested legal costs and expenses incurred in the Strasbourg proceedings amounting to GBP 35,490.', '56. Counsel for the Government suggested at the hearing before the Court that this amount was excessive.', '57. The Court, deciding on an equitable basis, awards GBP 25,000 in respect of the costs and expenses of the Strasbourg proceedings, together with any VAT which may be payable.', 'D. Default interest', '58. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.']",3,gb,001-58134,1

The second applicant, Mr Savvas Mandalarides, was born in 1948 and lives at Agria Volou. The third applicant, Mr Ioannis Sarandis, was born in 1951 and lives in Kamatero Attikis.', 'At the time of the events in question, the three applicants were officers in the same unit of the Greek air force. They were all followers of the Pentecostal Church, a Protestant Christian denomination which adheres to the principle that it is the duty of all believers to engage in evangelism.', 'The alleged acts of proselytism', 'The alleged proselytising of airman Georgios Antoniadis by the first and second applicants', '8. In the evidence he gave for the purposes of the prosecution against the applicants (see paragraph 13 below), airman Antoniadis said that he was transferred to the applicants’ unit in 1986, two months after joining the air force, and was placed under the command of the second applicant in the teletyping service. On approximately seven occasions the first and second applicants engaged him in religious discussions, reading aloud extracts from the Bible and encouraging him to accept the beliefs of the Pentecostal Church. The second applicant told him that some members of the sect were able to speak in foreign languages with the assistance of divine power. Whenever airman Antoniadis returned from leave, the second applicant asked him if he had visited the Pentecostal Church. The former testified that he felt obliged to take part in these discussions because the applicants were his superior officers.', 'The alleged proselytising of airman Athanassios Kokkalis by the first and third applicants', '9. In his statement before the Athens Permanent Air Force Court (see paragraph 13 below), airman Kokkalis testified that he served in the applicants’ unit between spring 1987 and October 1988, although he was not under the direct command of any of them. During that time the first applicant engaged him in theological discussions on approximately thirty occasions, and the third applicant on approximately fifty occasions, initially concealing the fact that they were not Orthodox Christians but subsequently criticising some of the tenets of that faith and urging airman Kokkalis to accept their beliefs. The third applicant repeatedly asked him to visit the Pentecostal Church in Larissa while he was on leave, telling him that miracles took place there including the acquisition by believers of the ability to speak in foreign languages, and gave him the Pentecostal newspaper Christianismos to read. The applicants were very good officers and were always polite to him, but their approaches bothered him nonetheless.', 'The alleged proselytising of airman Nikolaos Kafkas by the first and third applicants', '10. Airman Nikolaos Kafkas was unable to give evidence at the first- instance hearing because his wife was ill, but he told the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (see paragraph 21 below) that he had served in the same unit as the applicants, under the command of the third applicant, between winter 1988 and August 1989. The applicants did not put any pressure on him to become a member of the Pentecostal Church. He himself approached the third applicant and asked why he was so peaceful, to which the latter replied that this was the result of reading the Gospel. When, at the suggestion of the first and third applicants, he started to read the Bible, he noticed a number of points of divergence between it and the teachings of the Orthodox Church. He did not have any discussions with the applicants concerning the Orthodox and Pentecostal Churches, although he did seek their advice whenever he had any questions concerning the Bible and always found their replies convincing. They never gave him any Pentecostal literature or told him to go to the Pentecostal Church. The third applicant never authorised his absence for purposes related to the Pentecostal Church, which he had visited for the first time in September 1989, after he had been discharged from the armed forces.', 'Airman Kafkas’s father, Mr Alexandros Kafkas, told the first-instance court that his son had been converted from the Orthodox to the Pentecostal Church while serving in the air force under the orders of the third applicant. According to his father, shortly after he joined the unit his behaviour changed. He stopped seeing his friends, spent long periods of time in his room studying the Bible and listening to taped sermons and brought back from the barracks his television and radio sets and the books from which he used to study for university entrance examinations. He told his father that he had met two officers who were real Christians, unlike his father. When his parents followed him on one of his visits to the Pentecostal Church, he left home and went to live in Athens. He returned after twenty days, when he reconverted to the Orthodox Church, explaining to his father that the first and third applicants had converted him to the Pentecostal Church, taking advantage of their rank to exert pressure on him and using special skills of persuasion. They had told him that he would be given leave of absence if he promised to visit their church. When Alexandros Kafkas left to go on a trip, Nikolaos reconverted to the Pentecostal Church. His father concluded that his son had no will of his own and always did as he was told by other members of the Pentecostal Church.', 'The alleged proselytising of the Baïramis family and their neighbours by the second applicant', '11. According to the statement of Captain Ilias Baïramis, his brother-in-law, Mr Charalampos Apostolidis, a member of the Pentecostal Church, began one day to rage at his wife, telling her that he saw Satan in her. The second applicant was summoned, and as soon as he arrived Mr Apostolidis became calmer. The second applicant then preached a sermon to the members of the Baïramis family and some neighbours who had come to see what was going on, in the course of which he urged them all to convert to the Pentecostal religion.', 'The alleged proselytising of Mrs Anastassia Zounara by the second and third applicants', '12. In a statement prepared for the purposes of an administrative inquiry against the applicants, Mrs Anastassia Zounara explained that her husband had joined the Pentecostal Church, which led to the breakdown of her family life with him. In an attempt to understand her husband’s behaviour, Mrs Zounara visited the Pentecostal Church and the applicants’ homes on several occasions over a period of about five months. During this time the applicants, particularly the second and third applicants, used to visit her and urge her to join their Church. They told her that they had received signs from God and could predict the future, and that Mrs Zounara and her children were possessed by the devil. Eventually she developed psychological problems and severed all links with the applicants and the Pentecostal Church.', 'B. The trial at first instance', '13. On 18 May 1992, the applicants appeared before the Permanent Air Force Court ( Diarkes Stratodikio Aeroporias ) in Athens, composed of one officer with legal training and four other officers. They were tried for various offences of proselytism, under section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 as amended (henceforth, “section 4” – see paragraph 27 below).', '14. In a decision delivered on the day of the hearing (no. 209/92), the court rejected the defence’s argument that the law against proselytism was unconstitutional, finding that no issue could arise under the principle nullum crimen sine lege certa because of the non-exhaustive enumeration in the statute of the means by which an intrusion on another person’s religious beliefs could be brought about. It found all three applicants guilty of proselytism, holding in particular as follows.', '1. The first applicant', '15. In respect of the first applicant, the court observed:', '“The accused, while he was a military officer ... serving in Unit X, committed the offence of proselytism in the military camp of this unit between November 1986 and December 1987 by engaging in several acts which … gave rise to a single, albeit continuing, breach of the relevant criminal provision. He acted with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of airman Georgios Antoniadis, an Orthodox Christian who served in the same unit. Abusing the trust placed in him by airman Antoniadis, who was his hierarchical subordinate, the accused tried on approximately twenty occasions to persuade airman Antoniadis to become a member of the sect of the Pentecostal Church by engaging in discussions on theology with him in the course of which the accused contested the correctness of the teachings of the university department of theology concerning God and the Orthodox dogma. He also encouraged airman Antoniadis to read the Bible in the light of the accused’s own beliefs as a member of the Pentecostal Church, questioned the holy traditions and recommended that he visit the church of the Pentecostal sect in Athens.', 'Acting in the same capacity, the accused committed the offence of proselytism between May 1987 and February 1988 by engaging in several acts which … gave rise to a single, albeit continuing, breach of the relevant criminal provision. He acted with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of airman Athanassios Kokkalis, an Orthodox Christian who served in the same unit. On approximately thirty occasions the accused tried to persuade airman Kokkalis to become a member of the sect of the Church of Pentecost by engaging, persistently and importunately, in discussions with him about the correctness of his beliefs as a member of the sect of the Pentecostal Church, questioning the holiness of the Christian Orthodox Church and inviting airman Kokkalis to listen to taped recordings on the beliefs of the Pentecostal sect. The accused took advantage of the trust inherent in the relationship between a subordinate and a superior and of airman Kokkalis’s naïvety, inexperience and youth, telling him that in his Church some people started speaking foreign languages under the effect of the Holy Spirit.', ""Acting in the same capacity, the accused committed the offence of proselytism between spring 1989 and 18 August 1989, in the place mentioned above, by … acting with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of airman Nikolaos Kafkas, who served under his orders in the same unit. Taking advantage of the trust inherent in the relationship between a subordinate and a superior, and of the young man’s naïvety and inexperience, the accused tried to persuade airman Kafkas to become a member of the sect of the Church of Pentecost by continually, persistently and importunately expounding on his beliefs concerning the sect of the Pentecostal Church, reading and explaining the Bible in the light of his beliefs and providing him with copies of a tract entitled Christianismos. The accused succeeded in converting airman Kafkas by taking advantage of the latter's inexperience in theological matters and the influence he had on him due to his position and rank.”"", 'The court also found the first applicant guilty of proselytising another airman, Stefanos Voikos.', '16. It sentenced him to five months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Antoniadis, five months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Kokkalis, five months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Voikos and seven months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Kafkas. Overall, however, because some of these periods were to run concurrently, the first applicant was ordered to spend thirteen months in prison. The court ordered that these penalties be converted to fines and not enforced provided the applicant did not commit new offences in the following three years.', '2. The second applicant', '17. In respect of the second applicant, the court held as follows:', '“The accused, while he was a military officer ... serving in Unit X, committed the offence of proselytism in the military camp of this unit between November 1986 and December 1987 by engaging in several acts which … gave rise to a single, albeit continuing, breach of the relevant criminal provision. He took advantage of the authority exercisable by him due to the difference in rank over airman Georgiades Antoniadis, who served in the same unit. On approximately seven occasions, on dates which have not been specified, the accused tried to intrude on and change the religious beliefs of airman Antoniadis by means of skilful discussions with him concerning religion. The accused urged airman Antoniadis, because of his youth, to study nothing but the Gospel, where he told him he would find the truth, which differed from the Orthodox dogma. He also tried, by means of skilful interpretation of extracts from the Holy Gospel in accordance with the beliefs of the sect of the Pentecost, to convince him that the Orthodox faith was not correct and that he should adopt the beliefs of the accused, urging him at the same time in a pressing manner to visit during his leave the church of the Pentecostal sect in Athens.', 'The accused also committed the offence of proselytism in Vólos in 1988 by … taking advantage of the inexperience and intellectual weakness of Mrs Anastassia Zounara. He tried on several occasions, on dates which have not been specified, to intrude on and change her religious beliefs by engaging in a skilful analysis of the beliefs of the sect of the Pentecost and their difference from those of the Orthodox faith. Elaborating on the correctness of the former, he tried persistently to convince her that the followers of the Pentecostal Church bore marks given to them by God, that they could prophesy the future, that she and her children were possessed by the devil who was fighting to keep control over her, that she worshipped idols and demons and that the Pentecostal Church held the truth. He also urged her in a pressing manner to be baptised and become a member of the Pentecostal Church.', 'The accused also committed the offence of proselytism in Vólos on a date which has not been specified towards the beginning of June 1989. Having been summoned by Captain Ilias Baïramis, the accused went to the house of Mr Apostolos Baïramis, Captain Baïramis’s brother, where Mr Charalampos Apostolidis, the brother-in-law of the Baïramis brothers and a follower of the sect of the Pentecostal Church, was in a delirious state under the influence of his religious beliefs. He was foaming at the mouth, invoking Christ’s name and saying ‘Thank you Christ, because I have known the truth, I see the devil in my wife’s and children’s faces’. The mere fact of the accused’s presence calmed Mr Apostolidis, and the former skilfully took advantage of this by attempting to intrude upon and change the religious beliefs of Apostolos Baïramis and Marigoula, Sotirios and Evangelis Baïrami, who were present during the incident and had been impressed by it, and of a number of neighbours who gathered afterwards. He preached to them, elaborating on the beliefs of the sect of the Pentecostal Church and telling them that these, and not those of the Orthodox Church, were correct and that in 1992 the world would come to an end and the Church would be ‘captured’. He urged them persistently and importunately to believe in the true Christ and told them that, by virtue of being Christian Orthodox, they had taken sides with the devil.”', '18. The second applicant was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Antoniadis, five months’ imprisonment for proselytising Mrs Zounara, and eight months’ imprisonment for proselytising the Baïramis family and their neighbours, although he was only to serve twelve months overall. The court ordered that these penalties be converted to fines and not enforced provided the applicant did not commit new offences in the following three years.', '3. The third applicant', '19. In respect of the third applicant, the court held as follows:', '“The accused, while he was a military officer ... serving in Unit X, committed the offence of proselytism in the military camp of this unit between May 1987 and February 1988 by engaging in several acts which … gave rise to a single, albeit continuing, breach of the relevant criminal provision. He acted with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of airman Athanassios Kokkalis, an Orthodox Christian who served in the same unit. Taking advantage of the trust inherent in the relationship between a subordinate and a superior, the accused tried more than fifty times to convince airman Kokkalis that the teachings of the Orthodox faith were not correct on a number of issues, such as the virginity of the Holy Mother, the ranks of the priests and the power of the Holy Spirit. He engaged with airman Kokkalis in persistent and importunate discussions regarding the teachings of the sect of the Pentecostal Church, of which the accused was a follower, telling him that the teachings of the sect, rather than those of the Orthodox Church, were correct. He urged him to visit a place in Larissa where the followers of the Pentecostal Church used to gather and to become a member of the sect and he gave him a free copy of a periodical published by the followers of the Pentecostal Church entitled Christianismos. In the course of these encounters the accused intentionally failed to reveal to airman Kokkalis that he was a member of the Pentecostal sect.', 'Acting in the same capacity, the accused committed the offence of proselytism in the same place for a period of four to five months in 1988, … acting with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of Mrs Anastassia Zounara, an Orthodox Christian. He skilfully took advantage of her inexperience in religious matters and her intellectual weakness, resulting from her low level of education, and tried importunately to persuade her to be baptised and become a member of the sect of the Pentecostal Church. He told her constantly that he bore signs given to him by God, that he could foresee the future and that she and her children were possessed. His intention was to undermine her faith in Orthodoxy and convert her to the sect of the Pentecostal Church.', 'Acting in the same capacity, the accused committed the offence of proselytism in the same place between spring 1989 and 18 August 1989, … acting with the aim of intruding on and changing the religious beliefs of airman Nikolaos Kafkas, an Orthodox Christian who served in the same unit. Taking advantage of the trust inherent in the relationship between a subordinate and a superior and of airman Kafkas’s naïvety and inexperience, the accused tried to persuade him to adhere to the sect of the Pentecostal Church. He engaged in continual, persistent and importunate analysis of his beliefs regarding the sect of the Pentecostal Church, continually reading the Gospel which he interpreted in accordance with his beliefs. He gave airman Kafkas publications of his sect and took him to his place of worship. In this way, he succeeded in converting airman Kafkas, taking advantage of his inexperience in religious matters and the influence he had on him because of his position and rank.”', 'The court also found that the third applicant had engaged in the proselytising of a warrant officer, Adjutant Theophilos Tsikas.', '20. He was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Kokkalis, five months’ imprisonment for proselytising Mrs Zounara, five months’ imprisonment for proselytising Adjutant Tsikas and seven months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Kafkas. He was to serve fourteen months overall. The court ordered that these penalties be converted to fines and not enforced provided the applicant did not commit new offences in the following three years.', 'C. The appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court', '21. The applicants appealed immediately to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court ( Anatheoritiko Dikastirio ), a court composed of five military judges. Their appeal was heard on 7 October 1992.', '22. In a judgment pronounced immediately after the hearing (no. 390/1992), the Appeal Court rejected the defence’s argument to the effect that the accused had merely exercised a constitutional right and upheld most of their convictions, using the same reasoning as the first- instance court. It did, however, reverse the conviction of the first applicant for proselytising airman Voikos and that of the third applicant for proselytising Adjutant Tsikas (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above).', '23. The Appeal Court maintained the penalties imposed by the first-instance court on the first and third applicants in respect of the convictions it had upheld. However, because of the quashing of the two convictions, their overall sentences were reduced to eleven and twelve months respectively.', 'It reduced the second applicant’s sentence to four months’ imprisonment for proselytising airman Antoniadis, four months for proselytising Mrs Zounara, and six months for proselytising the Baïramis family and neighbours. His overall sentence was reduced to ten months’ imprisonment.', ""24. As none of the overall sentences imposed involved more than one year's imprisonment, they were automatically converted by the court into pecuniary penalties of 1,000 drachmas per day. The court ordered that the penalties should not be enforced provided that the applicants did not commit new criminal offences in the following three years."", 'D. The appeal to the Court of Cassation', '25. The applicants appealed in cassation.', 'In a judgment delivered on 30 July 1993 (no. 1266/1993), the Court of Cassation ( Arios Pagos ) found as follows:', '“It follows from section 4(1) and (2) of Law no. 1363/1938 [see paragraph 27 below] that in order for the crime of proselytism … to be established, there must be a direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion with the aim of undermining those beliefs, provided that the attempt is made using the means enumerated in a non-exhaustive fashion in the above-mentioned section, namely by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of the other person’s inexperience, trust, need, low intelligence or naïvety.', 'The above-mentioned provisions of this section … are not contrary to [ the provisions of the Greek Constitution guaranteeing the principle nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ]; moreover, they are perfectly consistent with Article 13 of the Constitution [see paragraph 26 below], which provides that all known religions are free since, under Article 13, proselytism is prohibited… The argument to the contrary finds no support in the fact that under [the previous Constitutions] the prohibition of proselytism was designed to protect the then (and still) dominant religion, whereas under the present Constitution that prohibition is associated with freedom of conscience in religious matters relating to all known religions. This reasoning is undeniably consistent with both the letter and the spirit [of section 4], pursuant to which protection from proselytism employing the unlawful means set out therein is provided for the religious convictions of all persons of different persuasions,', 'i.e. all those belonging to a religion or dogma other than that of the author of the proselytism, and not exclusively those professing the principles of the Orthodox Church.', 'Furthermore, freedom of conscience in religious matters and of thought, protected as a human right by the present Constitution and by Articles 18 and 19 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration and Articles 9 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, is not undermined by the above-mentioned criminal provision, since it does not sanction the holding of religious beliefs, which is completely free, but only any attempt to intrude on another person’s religious beliefs with the aim of changing them. Such attempts are quite incompatible with religious freedom, which creates an obligation to respect the religious convictions of all those who hold different beliefs.”', 'The court therefore dismissed the applicants’ appeal.']","['II. Relevant domestic law', 'The right to religious freedom under the Greek Constitution', '26. Article 13 of the Greek Constitution provides, as relevant:', '“1. Freedom of conscience in religious matters is inviolable. The enjoyment of personal and political rights shall not depend on an individual’s religious beliefs.', '2. There shall be freedom to practise any known religion; individuals shall be free to perform their rites of worship without hindrance and under the protection of the law. The performance of rites of worship must not prejudice public order or public morals. Proselytism is prohibited.”', 'The law on proselytism', '27. Section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938, as amended by Law no. 1672/1939, provides as follows:', '“1. Anyone engaging in proselytism shall be liable to imprisonment and a fine of between 1,000 and 50,000 drachmas; he shall, moreover, be subject to police supervision for a period of between six months and one year to be fixed by the court when convicting the offender.', '2. By ‘proselytism’ is meant, in particular, any direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion ( eterodoxos ), with the aim of undermining those beliefs, either by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of the other person’s inexperience, trust, need, low intellect or naïvety.', '3. The commission of such an offence in a school or other educational establishment or philanthropic institution shall constitute a particularly aggravating circumstance.”', 'There is a considerable body of case-law interpreting and applying this section: see the Court’s Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, pp. 13–15, §§ 17–21.', 'proceedings before the commission', '28. In their applications lodged with the Commission on 28 January 1994 (nos. 23372/94, 26377/94 and 26378/94), Mr Larissis, Mr Mandalarides and Mr Sarandis claimed that section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 was too broad and vague to be compatible with the requirements of legal certainty under Articles 7, 9 § 2 and 10 § 2 of the Convention. In addition, they complained that their convictions for proselytism amounted to violations of their rights to freedom of religion and expression under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, and were discriminatory, contrary to Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 9.', '29. On 27 November 1995, the Commission ordered the joinder of the three applications under Rule 35 of its Rules of Procedure and declared them admissible.', '30. In its report of 12 September 1996 (Article 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been violations of Article 9 of the Convention in so far as the second applicant was convicted of proselytising the Baïramis family and their neighbours (unanimously) and in so far as the second and third applicants had been convicted of proselytising Mrs Zounara (twenty-four votes to five). However, it found no violation of Article 9 in so far as the first and second applicants were convicted of proselytising airman Antoniadis and the first and third applicants were convicted of proselytising airman Kokkalis (twenty-eight votes to one), and in so far as the first and third applicants were convicted of proselytising airman Kafkas (twenty-three votes to six).', 'It further concluded that there had been no violation of Article 7 of the Convention (twenty-eight votes to one) and that no separate issue arose under Article 10 of the Convention (unanimously) nor under Article 9 in conjunction with Article 14 in so far as the second applicant was convicted of proselytising the Baïramis family and neighbours and the second and third applicants were convicted of proselytising Mrs Zounara (unanimously). Finally, it concluded that there had been no violation of Articles 9 and 14 taken together in so far as the first and second applicants were convicted of proselytising airman Antoniadis and the first and third applicants were convicted of proselytising airmen Kokkalis and Kafkas (unanimously).', 'The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. [4]', 'final submissions to the court', '31. In their memorial and at the hearing before the Court, the Government maintained that no violation of the Convention had arisen in the applicants’ case.', 'The applicants, however, asked the Court to find violations of Articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention and to award them just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'as to the law', 'i. alleged violation of article 7 of the convention', '32. The applicants contended that the law against proselytism failed to comply with Article 7 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.', '2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.”', 'They argued that the Greek law violated the principle enshrined in Article 7 that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ), since it was impossible to predict whether certain types of behaviour would lead to a prosecution for proselytism. They contended that this deficiency in the law was evident both from the text of section 4(2) (see paragraph 27 above) and the jurisprudence which had arisen from it.', 'For example, the use of the words “in particular” implied that the subsequent definition was only one form of proselytism punishable under the statute, and other expressions employed, such as “direct or indirect” and “any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance” were so broad and vague as to embrace almost any form of practical evangelism. The case-law which had grown out of section 4 (see the examples set out in the Court’s Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 13, § 18), showed that no one in Greece could possibly determine in advance whether or not his religious actions would constitute the offence of proselytism.', '33. The Government and the Commission, referring to the above-mentioned Kokkinakis judgment, were both of the opinion that there had been no violation of this provision.', '34. The Court recalls its finding in the above-mentioned Kokkinakis case ( op. cit., p. 22, § 52) that the definition of the offence of proselytism contained in section 4, together with the settled body of national case-law interpreting and applying it, satisfied the conditions of certainty and foreseeability prescribed by Article 7.', 'It is not persuaded that the position in Greek law has become any less clear in the period of under five years since that evaluation. Bearing in mind that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (ibid., p. 19, § 40), it sees no reason to reverse its previous decision.', '35. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 7 of the Convention.', 'ii. alleged violation of article 9 of the convention', '36. The applicants claimed that their prosecution, conviction and punishment for proselytism amounted to violations of Article 9 of the Convention, which states:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.', '2. Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', 'The Government denied that there had been any such breach. The Commission found that there had been no violation with regard to the measures taken against the applicants for the proselytising of the airmen, although it found that Article 9 had been violated in so far as the proselytising of civilians was concerned (see paragraph 31 above).', '37. The Court must consider whether the applicants’ Article 9 rights were interfered with and, if so, whether such interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2.', 'A. Interference', '38. The Court considers, and indeed it was not disputed by those appearing before it, that the prosecution, conviction and punishment of the applicants for offences of proselytism amounted to interferences with the exercise of their rights to “freedom … to manifest [their] religion or belief” (see the Kokkinakis judgment cited at paragraph 32 above, p.18, § 36).', 'B. “Prescribed by law”', '39. The applicants, for the same reasons they had advanced in support of a finding of violation of Article 7 (see paragraph 32 above), contended that the measures taken against them were not “prescribed by law”, as required by Article 9 § 2.', 'The Government and the Commission were of the contrary opinion, again relying on the Court’s Kokkinakis judgment.', '40. The Court recalls that the expression “prescribed by law” in Article 9 § 2 requires, inter alia, that the law in question must be both adequately accessible to the individual and formulated with sufficient precision to enable him to regulate his conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49).', '41. It refers to its finding in the above-mentioned Kokkinakis case that the measures taken against that applicant under section 4 were “prescribed by law” (op. cit. , pp. 19–20, §§ 40–41). As the Court has already concluded in relation to Article 7 (see paragraphs 34–35 above), it is not satisfied that the position in Greek law has changed subsequently or that it should depart from its earlier assessment for any other reason.', '42. In conclusion, the measures in question were “prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2.', 'C. Legitimate aim', '43. The Government, with whom the Commission agreed, reasoned that the relevant action was taken against the applicants with the aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and also, as far as the measures taken following the proselytising of the airmen were concerned, with the aim of preventing disorder in the armed forces and thus protecting public safety and order.', 'The applicants made no particular submission in this connection.', '44. Having regard to the circumstances of the case and, particularly, the terms of the national courts’ decisions, the Court considers that the impugned measures essentially pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others (see also the above-mentioned Kokkinakis judgment, p. 20, § 44).', 'D. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '45. The Court emphasises at the outset that while religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one’s] religion”, including the right to try to convince one’s neighbour, for example through “teaching” (ibid. , p. 17, § 31).', 'Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief. It does not, for example, protect improper proselytism, such as the offering of material or social advantage or the application of improper pressure with a view to gaining new members for a Church (ibid ., p. 21, § 48).', '46. The Court’s task is to determine whether the measures taken against the applicants were justified in principle and proportionate. In order to do this, it must weigh the requirements of the protection of the rights and liberties of others against the conduct of the applicants (ibid. , p. 21, § 47). Since different factors come into the balance in relation to the proselytising of the airmen and that of the civilians, it will assess the two matters separately.', '1. The proselytising of the airmen', '47. The Government contended that the applicants had abused the influence they enjoyed as air force officers and had committed the acts in question in a systematic and repetitive manner. The measures taken against them were justified by the need to protect the prestige and effective operation of the armed forces and to protect individual soldiers from ideological coercion.', '48. The applicants submitted that the practice of evangelism within a superior/subordinate relationship could not without more be equated to an abuse of trust. They emphasised that the airmen were adults, able to die for their country, and that there was no evidence that the applicants had used their positions to coerce or override the wills of their subordinates. To interpret Article 9 so as to restrict evangelism to “equals” would be a severe limitation of religious freedom, both within the armed forces and in other contexts.', '49. The Commission found that the interference could be justified as ensuring that the three airmen’s religious beliefs were respected, in view in particular of the special character of the relationship between a superior and a subordinate in the armed forces, which rendered the subordinate more susceptible to influence in a variety of matters including religious beliefs.', '50. The Court observes that it is well established that the Convention applies in principle to members of the armed forces as well as to civilians. Nevertheless, when interpreting and applying its rules in cases such as the present, it is necessary to bear in mind the particular characteristics of military life and its effects on the situation of individual members of the armed forces (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 23, § 54, and, mutatis mutandis, the Grigoriades v. Greece judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII, pp. 2589–90, § 45).', '51. In this respect, the Court notes that the hierarchical structures which are a feature of life in the armed forces may colour every aspect of the relations between military personnel, making it difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of an individual of superior rank or to withdraw from a conversation initiated by him. Thus, what would in the civilian world be seen as an innocuous exchange of ideas which the recipient is free to accept or reject, may, within the confines of military life, be viewed as a form of harassment or the application of undue pressure in abuse of power. It must be emphasised that not every discussion about religion or other sensitive matters between individuals of unequal rank will fall within this category. Nonetheless, where the circumstances so require, States may be justified in taking special measures to protect the rights and freedoms of subordinate members of the armed forces.', '52. The Court refers to the evidence adduced in the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 8–10 above).', 'It notes that airmen Antoniadis and Kokkalis testified that the applicants approached them on a number of occasions in order to persuade them to convert and to visit the Pentecostal Church. Mr Antoniadis stated that he felt obliged to take part in the discussions because the applicants were his superior officers, and Mr Kokkalis said that the applicants’ approaches bothered him. As the Commission found, there is no evidence that the applicants used threats or inducements. Nonetheless, it appears that they were persistent in their advances and that these two airmen felt themselves constrained and subject to a certain degree of pressure owing to the applicants’ status as officers, even if this pressure was not consciously applied.', '53. The Court notes that, contrary to the evidence given by his father at first instance, airman Kafkas testified before the Courts-Martial Appeal Court that the applicants did not apply any pressure to him to become a member of the Pentecostal Church and that he himself initiated the religious discussions that took place between them (see paragraph 10 above). However, the Appeal Court, having had the opportunity to assess the evidence, including Mr Kafkas’s demeanour and credibility, upheld the first-instance court’s decision that the first and third applicants had unlawfully taken advantage of the influence they had over Mr Kafkas due to their position and rank (see paragraphs 15, 18 and 22 above). The Court, considering that the domestic courts were better placed than itself to determine the facts of the case, and taking into account the matters referred to in paragraph 51 above, is of the view that Mr Kafkas, like the other two airmen, must have felt to a certain extent constrained, perhaps obliged to enter into religious discussions with the applicants, and possibly even to convert to the Pentecostal faith.', '54. In view of the above, the Court considers that the Greek authorities were in principle justified in taking some measures to protect the lower ranking airmen from improper pressure applied to them by the applicants in their desire to promulgate their religious beliefs. It notes that the measures taken were not particularly severe and were more preventative than punitive in nature, since the penalties imposed were not enforceable if the applicants did not reoffend within the following three years (see paragraphs 16, 18, 20 and 24 above). In all the circumstances of the case, it does not find that these measures were disproportionate.', '55. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 9 with regard to the measures taken against the first applicant for the proselytising of airmen Antoniadis, Kokkalis and Kafkas, those taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of airman Antoniadis or those taken against the third applicant for the proselytising of airmen Kokkalis and Kafkas.', '2. The proselytising of the civilians', '56. The Government reminded the Court that under section 4, only improper proselytism is punishable. They contended that the second and third applicants had systematically exploited the family problems and psychological distress suffered by the Baïramis family and Mrs Zounara and had thus applied unlawful pressure. Furthermore, the penalties imposed on them were not particularly onerous.', '57. The Commission, with whom the applicants agreed, considered that the circumstances leading to the conviction of the second and third applicants for proselytising the Baïramis family and Mrs Zounara were similar to those of the Kokkinakis case (cited at paragraph 32 above), in that the “targets” of the proselytism were not military personnel and the domestic courts established the defendants’ guilt by reciting the words of section 4 without adequately explaining in what way the methods employed by the accused had been “improper”. It had not been satisfactorily demonstrated that their convictions on these counts were “necessary in a democratic society”.', '58. The Court recalls that the second applicant was convicted under section 4 for preaching on a single occasion to the Baïramis family and their neighbours, following an incident when he had managed to calm a member of the Baïramis family who was in a delirious state. Together with the third applicant, he was also convicted for the proselytising of Mrs Zounara, whom they had attempted to convert on a number of occasions during a period when she was experiencing marital problems (see paragraphs 11, 12, 17 and 19 above).', '59. The Court finds it of decisive significance that the civilians whom the applicants attempted to convert were not subject to pressures and constraints of the same kind as the airmen.', 'With regard to the Baïramis family and their neighbours, none of the evidence indicates that they felt obliged to listen to the applicant or that his behaviour towards them was improper in any way.', 'As for Mrs Zounara, it was not disputed before the domestic courts that she initially sought out the applicants in an attempt to understand the reasons behind her husband’s behaviour. Whilst it is clear that during the period she was in contact with them she was in a state of distress brought on by the breakdown of her marriage, the Court does not find it established that her mental condition was such that she was in need of any special protection from the evangelical activities of the applicants or that they applied improper pressure to her, as was demonstrated by the fact that she was able eventually to take the decision to sever all links with the Pentecostal Church.', '60. For the above reasons, the Court does not consider that the second and third applicants’ convictions on the charges in question were justified in the circumstances of the case.', '61. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 9 with regard to the measures taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of the Baïramis family and their neighbours and those taken against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of Mrs Zounara.', 'iii. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '62. The applicants claimed that the measures taken against them had also interfered with their rights to freedom of expression, in breach of Article 10 of the Convention, which states, as relevant:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority…', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '63. The Commission, with whom the Government agreed, found that no separate issue arose under this provision.', '64. Having regard to its scrutiny of this case in the context of Article 9, the Court also agrees that no separate issue arises in relation to Article 10.', 'iv. alleged violation of article 14 of the convention taken together with article 9', '65. The applicants alleged that they had been the victims of discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention, which provides:', '“ The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status .”', 'They contended that the law against proselytism was applied only to members of religious minorities in Greece, no follower of the Orthodox Church ever having been convicted of the offence under section 4.', '66. The Government made no particular submission in relation to this complaint.', '67. The Commission found that no separate issue arose under Articles 9 and 14 taken together in relation to the measures directed against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of the civilians. As far as the measures taken against the applicants for the proselytising of the airmen were concerned, since no material was provided to substantiate the complaint under Articles 9 and 14, it reached a finding of no violation.', '68. The Court notes that the applicants alleged in their memorial that the Greek law against proselytism was applied in a discriminatory manner. However, they have not produced any evidence to suggest that an officer in the armed forces who attempted to convert his subordinates to the Orthodox Church in a manner similar to that adopted by the applicants would have been treated any differently. It follows that no violation of Articles 9 and 14 taken together has been established in connection with the proselytising of the airmen.', '69. Having found a violation of Article 9 with regard to the measures taken against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of the Baïramis family and Mrs Zounara, the Court considers that no separate issue arises in that connection under Articles 9 and 14 taken together.', 'V. application of article 50 of the convention', '70. The applicants requested just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '71. The applicants sought 500,000 drachmas (GRD) each to compensate them for moral and material prejudice. This was the amount that the Court had awarded to Mr Kokkinakis in 1993 (op. cit., p. 23, § 60).', '72. At the hearing before the Court, the Government submitted that, in the event of the Court finding a violation, such finding would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction.', '73. On the same occasion, the Commission’s Delegate commented that the fact that the domestic courts had not sought to take the Court’s case-law into account was a particular element to be taken into consideration under Article 50.', '74. The Court observes that it has found violations of the Convention in respect only of the measures taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of the Baïramis family and the second and third applicants for the proselytising of Mrs Zounara (see paragraphs 58–61 above). The first applicant is not, therefore, entitled to any just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards GRD 500,000 each to Mr Mandalarides and Mr Sarandis.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '75. The applicants also requested 11,800 pounds sterling (GBP) to cover the legal costs and expenses of the proceedings before the Commission and Court in Strasbourg.', '76. The Government considered the amount claimed to be excessive and submitted that the sum awarded should not exceed GRD 1,000,000.', '77. The Court again notes in this context that it does not find any violation of the Convention in respect of the first applicant and that it finds in favour of the second and third applicants in connection with only one part of their complaints, namely in relation to the measures taken against them for the proselytising of civilians.', 'In the light of the above, it awards to the second and third applicants part of the costs and expenses claimed, in total GBP 6,000, together with any value-added tax which may be payable, less the amount received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.', 'C. Default interest', '78. According to the information available to the Court, the relevant statutory rates of interest applicable at the date of adoption of the present judgment are 6% per annum in Greece and 8% per annum in the United Kingdom.']",3,gr,001-58139,0

The applicant, who is a lawyer and former member of the Cantonal Council ( Großrat ), lives in Root (Canton of Lucerne). At the material time he was an advocate acting as defence counsel for a Mr S., who had been placed in detention pending trial ( Untersuchungshaft ) on suspicion of committing a number of thefts.', '7. On 6 November 1992 Mr S.’s wife informed Mr Schöpfer that the two district clerks ( Amtsschreiber ) of the Hochdorf district authority ( Amtsstatthalteramt ) had urged her to instruct a different lawyer to defend her husband if he wished to be released.', 'A. The applicant’s public statements', '8. On 9 November 1992 the applicant then held a press conference in his office in Lucerne at which he declared that at the Hochdorf district authority offices both the laws of the Canton of Lucerne and human rights were flagrantly disregarded, and had been for years ( werden sowohl die Luzerner Gesetze als auch die Menschenrechte in höchstem Grade verletzt, und zwar schon seit Jahren ). He pointed out that he was speaking to the press because it was his last resort ( deshalb bleibt mir nur noch der Weg über die Presse ).', '9. The following day the daily newspaper Luzerner Neueste Nachrichten (“the LNN ”) published the following article (at page 25):', '“Former Christian Democratic Party (CDP) councillor demands investigation into Hochdorf district authority', '‘I won’t let those gentlemen make a fool of me any longer’', 'Former CDP councillor Alois Schöpfer makes serious accusations against the Hochdorf district authority.', '‘I’ve had enough of letting those gentlemen at the Hochdorf district authority make a fool of me’ thundered Alois Schöpfer. ‘So the only recourse left to me is to take the matter to the press.’ The former CDP councillor was prompted to take the unusual step of approaching the public during pending proceedings on account of a case entrusted to him as a lawyer in mid-October. At that time his client had already been in pre-trial detention at the Hochdorf district authority prison for a month.', 'Detained without an arrest warrant', 'The 20 year-old father of a one and a half year-old daughter was arrested on 18 August with his brother for the theft of car radios and clothes, and released after admitting the offences. When, on 15 September, he went to the Lucerne cantonal police to ask how his brother was, he was again immediately arrested.', '‘When I enquired at the Hochdorf district authority about the arrest warrant, I was told that the order had been issued to him orally’ said Alois Schöpfer, who sees the conduct of the police as a clear breach of the cantonal Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 82 of which provides: ‘The arrest shall be carried out by the police, duly authorised by a written warrant of arrest.’', 'When these accusations were put to him, the Hochdorf prefect [Mr H. B.] was giving nothing away. ‘Where I’m in charge nobody is arrested without a written arrest warrant’, he said. ‘I cannot say any more about a pending case.’ On the other hand, Alois Schöpfer, who was asked by the accused’s wife to defend her husband, will not remain silent any longer: ‘The wife came to me because the lawyer appointed under the legal aid scheme had still not contacted his client even though he had been in pre-trial detention for six weeks.’', 'Schöpfer immediately contacted the officially appointed counsel who handed the case over to him. However, the Hochdorf district authority did not want Schöpfer to take over as defence counsel under the legal aid scheme and refused his request on 29 October on the ground that there were no reasons to dismiss the lawyer to whom the case had been assigned until then. He was, however, free to represent his client on a private basis.', 'Schöpfer as the ground for detention?', 'The last straw for Alois Schöpfer came when the accused’s wife informed him last Friday that [T.B.] and [B.B.], the two district clerks, had advised her not to keep him on the case. ‘They told me’ she confirmed for the LNN, ‘that my husband would not be released as long as Alois Schöpfer remained his defence counsel.’ But [T.B.] denied any involvement: ‘That’s ridiculous. I never said anything like that. [B.B.] can confirm that. He was present when I spoke with the man’s wife.’', 'Alois Schöpfer will not let the matter drop: ‘I demand the immediate resignation of the prefect and the district clerks and a thorough investigation of the case by an impartial commission of inquiry from outside the canton.’”', 'In a box inside the article was the following text:', '“ Accusations', 'It is not the first time that serious charges have been levelled against the Hochdorf district authority. Prefect [H.B.] was previously prosecuted in connection with the conviction of [H.S.], the Rothenburg debt collection officer [ Betreibungsbeamter ]. He was fined 400 francs by the Lucerne District Court for disclosure of official secrets. Although the Court of Appeal also found that the objective elements of the offence had been made out, [H.B.] was acquitted on appeal.”', 'The article was illustrated by two photographs, one showing the Hochdorf district authority building and the other Prefect H.B. with the caption: “Where I’m in charge nobody is arrested without a written arrest warrant ( Bei mir wird niemand ohne schriftlichen Haftbefehl festgehalten ).”', '10. Another daily newspaper, the Luzerner Zeitung, also published, on 10 November 1992, an article on the press conference under the title: “Young man arrested without a warrant? Lucerne lawyer accuses Hochdorf district authority of breaking the law ( Junger Mann ohne Haftbefehl verhaftet? Luzerner Anwalt wirft Amtsstatthalteramt Hochdorf Rechtsverletzungen vor ).”', '11. On 10 November 1992 the public prosecutor’s office ( Staatsanwaltschaft ) of the Canton of Lucerne issued a reply to the effect that the accused person concerned had been arrested in accordance with the law, and that the applicant had not filed an appeal against the refusal to allow him to take over as the officially appointed defence counsel. This reply was published in the press on 11 November 1992.', '12. On 13 November 1992 the Luzerner Zeitung published a summary of a press communiqué issued by the applicant in reply to the public prosecutor’s statement. According to Mr Schöpfer, S.’s arrest had breached both the Convention and – “in a crude and unacceptable manner ( in absolut grober und nicht mehr zu verantwortender Weise )” – the cantonal Code of Criminal Procedure. The applicant also quoted the following passage from a letter he had received from another lawyer: “The situation in Hochdorf is far from satisfactory... What makes it even worse is the fact that the judicial authorities know what is going on in Hochdorf and even make indirect allusions to the situation.” In conclusion, Mr Schöpfer called on the Court of Appeal and the Cantonal Council to look into the case.', '13. On 15 October, 3 November and 13 November 1992 the applicant had lodged applications for the release of Mr S. ( Haftentlassungsgesuch ), which the Hochdorf prefect refused on 19 October, 5 November and 16 November 1992 respectively.', 'Mr Schöpfer lodged an appeal ( Rekurs ) against the last of these decisions. This was dismissed by the Court of Appeal ( Obergericht ) of the Canton of Lucerne on 30 November 1992, on the ground, among others, that the prefect had subsequently validly extended Mr S.’s pre-trial detention, so that Mr S. no longer had standing to bring an action challenging the conditions of his arrest. It noted, however, that after his arrest Mr S. should have been brought, not before a district clerk, but before the prefect himself, the only person who could be considered a judge or other officer for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. It therefore ordered that its decision should be brought to the attention of the public prosecutor’s office, which was the prefect’s supervisory authority ( Aufsichtsbehörde ).', 'B. The disciplinary proceedings against the applicant', '14. On 16 November 1992 the Lucerne Bar’s Supervisory Board ( Aufsichtsbehörde über die Rechtsanwälte ) informed Mr Schöpfer that his conduct raised certain ethical questions, relating in particular to the need for discretion ( Zurückhaltung ) with regard to pending proceedings and to covert publicity, and asked him what he had to say on the matter.', 'In a letter of 18 November which he communicated to the press, the applicant replied that he had acted only in the general interest and in that of his client.', '15. On 16 November 1992 the Hochdorf prefect had lodged a complaint ( Anzeige ) with the Supervisory Board and asked for disciplinary proceedings to be brought against Mr Schöpfer. He asserted that by his statements the latter had not only slandered the prefect and his two district clerks but had also been guilty of a serious breach of lawyers’ professional ethics ( Standesregeln ) by spreading false accusations through the media rather than making use of the available legal remedies.', '16. On 21 December 1992 the Supervisory Board brought disciplinary proceedings against the applicant.', 'On 15 March 1993, pursuant to Article 13 of the Statute of the Bar ( Anwaltsgesetz ) of the Canton of Lucerne (see paragraph 18 below), it fined him 500 Swiss francs (CHF) for a breach of professional ethics ( Verletzung von Berufs- und Standespflichten ).', 'In its decision the Supervisory Board observed in particular that the applicant had omitted to refer his complaints – which were serious – in the first place to the public prosecutor’s office or the Court of Appeal, which were the relevant supervisory bodies for the district authority. He had therefore failed to observe the discretion which lawyers were required to maintain, in public, with regard to pending proceedings. In addition, he had engaged in covert publicity ( versteckte Reklame ) and cheap showmanship ( Effekthascherei ), thus demonstrating that he was more concerned about his own public profile than about the merits of the case. In any event, lawyers’ statements to the press always had to be not only of real public interest ( reelles öffentliches Interesse ) but also objective and moderate in tone ( objektiv in der Darstellung und sachlich im Ton ).', 'But the tone of a number of passages in Mr Schöpfer’s statements to the press left something to be desired. For example he had said: “I won’t let those gentlemen make a fool of me any longer” and “I demand … a thorough investigation of the case by an impartial commission of inquiry from outside the canton” and also “So the only recourse left to me is to take the matter to the press.” This last statement was not even true, since at that time Mr Schöpfer had not even applied to the relevant supervisory bodies for the district authority, nor had he tried exercising the ordinary legal remedies. He had thus disparaged not only the Hochdorf district authority but all the canton’s judicial authorities, which was incompatible with a lawyer’s professional ethics.', '17. The applicant lodged a public-law appeal against the above decision. This was dismissed by the Federal Court on 21 April 1994.', 'It observed that lawyers enjoyed considerable freedom to criticise the judicial authorities, provided that this was done according to the correct procedures, and in the first place in the course of representing and defending their clients. When, however, a lawyer appealed to public opinion, he was under a duty, like any other person employed in the service of justice, to refrain from any conduct inconducive to the proper administration thereof. Article 10 § 2 of the Convention also enunciated the principle that interference could be justified if its purpose was to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. Admittedly, there might be circumstances in which the public interest required alleged violations of constitutional or human rights to be made public. In order to determine whether that was the case, it was necessary to ascertain how obvious the alleged violations were, whether pending proceedings were likely to be influenced, whether the available remedies had been exercised and in what form the criticism had been made.', 'In the instant case Mr Schöpfer had been punished not so much for denouncing human rights violations as for the way in which he had done so. When considering the case the Supervisory Board had indeed taken into account the fact that one of the complaints raised by the applicant, concerning the fact that Mr S. had been brought before a district clerk rather than the prefect, had subsequently been upheld by the Court of Appeal. However, Mr Schöpfer’s other criticisms – which were likely to influence pending proceedings – had been found by the Supervisory Board to be unjustified. Furthermore, the Board had ruled that the applicant had not employed the right tone in his criticism and that he had made untrue allegations. It had given sufficient grounds for its decision and the applicant had not adduced any convincing counter-arguments.']","['ii. relevant domestic law', '18. Article 10 of the Statute of the Bar ( Anwaltsgesetz ) of the Canton of Lucerne establishes a Lawyers’ Supervisory Board ( Aufsichtsbehörde über die Anwälte ) whose members – two judges of the Court of Appeal, one administrative court judge and two lawyers – are appointed by the Court of Appeal for four years. Under Article 12 § 1 of the Statute the Board has jurisdiction to investigate lawyers’ breaches of professional ethics ( Berufs- und Standespflichten ) and may impose disciplinary penalties. Under Article 13 these range from a reprimand ( Verweis ) to temporary or permanent disbarment, with fines of up to CHF 5,000 as intermediate penalties.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '19. Mr Schöpfer applied to the Commission on 11 August 1994, alleging that the disciplinary penalty imposed on him had breached Article 10 of the Convention.', '20. The Commission (Second Chamber) declared the application (no. 25405/94 ) admissible on 4 September 1996. In its report of 9 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion by nine votes to six that there had been no violation of that provision. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '21. In their memorial the Government requested the Court “to declare that there [had] been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case”.', '22. In his memorial the applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been a breach of Article 10 and to order Switzerland to pay him compensation for the damage he had sustained.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'Alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention', '23. Mr Schöpfer alleged that the penalty imposed on him by the Lawyers’ Supervisory Board had breached Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '24. The penalty in issue incontestably amounted to “interference” with the applicant’s exercise of his freedom of expression. The participants in the proceedings agreed that it was “prescribed by law” and pursued a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 10 § 2, namely maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. It is apparent from the Supervisory Board’s decision of 15 March 1993 that the penalty in question was imposed on the applicant because, inter alia, he had disparaged all the canton’s judicial authorities (see paragraph 16 above).', 'The Court, which agrees with the participants on this point, must now determine, therefore, whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve that aim.', '25. The applicant explained that the reason why he had chosen to make his criticisms through the press was that it was not only his client’s case which gave him cause for concern but an intolerable situation that had persisted for years at the Hochdorf district authority. He had already exercised remedies against this state of affairs in connection with previous cases, but to no avail.', 'Mr Schöpfer asserted that he had deliberately refrained from appealing against the Hochdorf district authority’s refusal of his application to take over as his client’s officially appointed counsel so as not to make that issue the central theme of the case. In any event, such appeals were usually unsuccessful. It was only when his client’s wife had come to tell him that, according to district authority officials, her husband would remain incarcerated for as long as he, Schöpfer, was defending him that he had decided to speak to the press. He could, admittedly, have complained to the public prosecutor’s office, which was the district authority’s supervisory authority, but the statements the public prosecutor’s office had made to the newspapers after the press conference were enough to show that such a step would also have been bound to fail.', 'Moreover, in his statements he had not criticised the judiciary as such but only the conduct of the Hochdorf prefect and, indirectly, that of the public prosecutor’s office, as the supervisory authority. His criticisms had been justified, since they had been aimed not at an isolated case but at a long-standing practice contrary to the Convention. A lawyer who noted that such a practice had been followed to the detriment of a number of his clients had the right to begin a public debate on the subject. Furthermore, he had expressed his opinion not only as a lawyer but also as a politician.', '26. The Government submitted that a distinction had to be drawn in the first place, according to the case-law of the Federal Court, between a lawyer’s statements in the context of judicial proceedings and statements made outside the context of such proceedings, inasmuch as there might be stricter requirements for a lawyer who expressed an opinion in public. Only in special circumstances would he be justified in doing so and he should be objective in the way he presented the facts and moderate in tone.', 'Further, the criticisms of the Hochdorf district authority were not only formulated in totally exaggerated terms, they were also without foundation. The only substantiated complaint, the one concerning the fact that Mr Schöpfer’s client had been brought before a district clerk, had been upheld by the Court of Appeal and had then been taken into account during the disciplinary proceedings, by the Lawyers’ Supervisory Board and the Federal Court. But even that complaint, which, according to the applicant, concerned an extremely serious violation of human rights, had been formulated in unacceptably exaggerated terms for a lawyer, given the fact that it related to pending judicial proceedings.', 'Not content with making very serious allegations, Mr Schöpfer had in addition done so in a spiteful and aggressive tone, thus failing to observe the discretion, integrity and dignity that a lawyer should maintain. When seen against all that, the fine of CHF 500 imposed on the applicant appeared moderate in the light of the scale of penalties provided for in the Statute of the Bar of the Canton of Lucerne.', '27. In the Commission’s view, the applicant had exaggerated his grievances, by asserting for instance that for years the Hochdorf district authority had been flagrantly violating the laws of the Canton of Lucerne and human rights. In addition, he had omitted to exercise first of all the ordinary remedies at his disposal to raise the complaints he had made at the press conference. Moreover, he had made his allegations while the criminal proceedings against his client were still pending, which could be regarded as an attempt to exert pressure on the Hochdorf authorities dealing with the investigation and, more generally, to impair the independence of the judiciary. Lastly, the fine of CHF 500 was at the lower end of the scale of penalties provided for in the Statute of the Bar of the Canton of Lucerne. There had accordingly been no violation of Article 10.', '28. The Court notes that at his press conference on 9 November 1992 Mr Schöpfer complained, essentially, of the fact that his client had been arrested at the Hochdorf district authority offices without an arrest warrant and then brought before a district clerk, and that the district authority had refused his application to take over the case as his client’s defence counsel under the legal aid scheme (see paragraph 9 above). The Lawyers’ Supervisory Board, when it imposed the penalty on the applicant, attached great importance to the fact that he had preferred to speak to the press before exercising the available legal remedies (see paragraph 16 above).', '29. The Court reiterates that the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts. Such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar (see the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A, p. 21, § 54).', 'Moreover, the Court has already held that the courts – the guarantors of justice, whose role is fundamental in a State based on the rule of law – must enjoy public confidence (see the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 234, § 37). Regard being had to the key role of lawyers in this field, it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the proper administration of justice, and thus to maintain public confidence therein.', '30. In the present case Mr Schöpfer held his press conference on 9 November 1992, stating on that occasion, inter alia, that the journalists were his last resort (see paragraph 8 above). On 18 November 1992 he appealed to the Lucerne Court of Appeal against the Hochdorf prefect’s refusal of the application for his client’s release. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal for lack of standing, but upheld the complaint that bringing Mr Schöpfer’s client before one of the district clerks had been unlawful. It accordingly ordered its decision to be brought to the attention of the public prosecutor’s office, as the prefect’s supervisory authority (see paragraph 13 above).', '31. Thus Mr Schöpfer first publicly criticised the administration of justice in Hochdorf and then exercised a legal remedy which proved effective with regard to the complaint in question. In so doing his conduct was scarcely compatible with the contribution it is legitimate to expect lawyers to make to maintaining public confidence in the judicial authorities.', '32. The above finding is reinforced by the seriousness and general nature of the criticisms made by the applicant and the tone in which he chose to make them. For example, he said at the press conference that he was speaking to the journalists because they were his last resort and because at the Hochdorf district authority offices the laws of the Canton of Lucerne and human rights had for years been flagrantly disregarded (see paragraph 8 above). On 13 November 1992 a daily newspaper published a summary of a press release in which Mr Schöpfer had stated that his client’s arrest had breached the Convention and – “in a crude and unacceptable manner” – the cantonal Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 12 above).', '33. It is true that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see the De Haes and Gijsels judgment cited above, p. 236, § 48). It also goes without saying that freedom of expression is secured to lawyers too, who are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice, but their criticism must not overstep certain bounds. In that connection, account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved, which include the public’s right to receive information about questions arising from judicial decisions, the requirements of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession (see the Casado Coca judgment cited above, p. 21, § 55, and the De Haes and Gijsels judgment cited above, pp. 233–34, § 37). Because of their direct, continuous contact with their members, the Bar authorities and a country’s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. That is why they have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference in this area, but this margin is subject to European supervision as regards both the relevant rules and the decisions applying them (see the Casado Coca judgment cited above, pp. 20–21, §§ 50 and 55).', '34. The Court notes that Mr Schöpfer – who was a lawyer – had raised in public his complaints on the subject of criminal proceedings which were at that time pending before a criminal court. In addition to the general nature, the seriousness and the tone of the applicant’s assertions, the Court notes that he first held a press conference, claiming that this was his last resort, and only afterwards lodged an appeal before the Lucerne Court of Appeal, which was partly successful. He also omitted to apply to the other supervisory body for the district authority, the public prosecutor’s office, whose ineffectiveness he did not attempt to establish except by means of mere assertions. Having regard also to the modest amount of the fine imposed on the applicant, the Court considers that the authorities did not go beyond their margin of appreciation in punishing Mr Schöpfer. There has accordingly been no breach of Article 10.']",3,ch,001-58167,0

The Socialist Party (“the SP”), the first applicant, was a political party that was dissolved by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 15 below).', 'Mr İlhan Kırıt and Mr Doğu Perinçek, the second and third applicants, were respectively Chairman and former Chairman of the SP. They live in Istanbul.', '8. The SP was formed on 1 February 1988. On the same day, its constitution and programme were submitted to the office of Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation for assessment of their compatibility with the Constitution and Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties (“Law no. 2820” – see paragraphs 16 and 17 below).', 'First application to have the Socialist Party dissolved and the prosecution of its leaders', '9. On 15 February 1988, when the SP was preparing to take part in a general election, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation (“Principal State Counsel”) applied to the Constitutional Court for an order dissolving the SP. Relying in particular on passages from its programme, he accused the party of having sought to establish the domination of the working class with a view to establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat (Articles 6, 10 and 14 and former Article 68 of the Constitution and sections 78 and 101(a) of Law no. 2820).', ""10. In a judgment of 8 December 1988, published in the Official Gazette of 16 May 1989, the Constitutional Court dismissed the application as unfounded, as it considered that the political objectives stated in the SP's programme did not infringe the Constitution."", '11. Criminal proceedings were then brought in the National Security Courts against some of the leaders of the SP, including Mr Perinçek. They were accused of spreading harmful propaganda in favour of the domination of one social class over the others, contrary to Article 142 of the Turkish Criminal Code, as then worded (see paragraph 18 below). The allegation against Mr Perinçek was based in particular on speeches he had made at two public meetings on 10 February 1990 at Diyabakır and 21 March 1990 at Van and on an article that had appeared in a political journal on 4 March 1990, that is to say before his election as Chairman of the SP on 6 July 1991. Following the repeal of Article 142 of the Criminal Code by Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act), the accused were all acquitted. The SP later published the speeches in question under the titles: “ Serhildan çağrıları-1, Kawa ateşi yaktı ” and “ Serhildan çağrıları-2, Karpuz değil cesaret ekin ” (see paragraph 13 below).', '12. On 26 August 1991 the High Electoral Committee – which had responsibility under the Constitution for ensuring the fairness of elections – decided that the SP satisfied all the conditions necessary to take part in the general election of 20 October 1991. The party consequently ran an election campaign.', 'B. Second application to have the Socialist Party dissolved', '13. On 14 November 1991 Principal State Counsel applied to the Constitutional Court for a second time for an order dissolving the SP.

Turks and Kurds remain brothers; there can be no brotherhood where there is slavery; there can be no brotherhood if one is master and the other slave; everyone should be equal and have the same rights... There can be no hope if Turks and Kurds do not unite... This equation should be noted down somewhere: the Turkish people plus the oppressed Kurdish people equals democracy, independence and freedom... Long live Kurdistan! ...”', 'Relying on an audiovisual recording of the latter meeting, Mr Perinçek nevertheless denied, at a hearing before the Constitutional Court on 12 May 1992, that he had uttered the last sentence.', 'C. Dissolution of the Socialist Party', ""14. On 28 November 1991 the Constitutional Court sent Principal State Counsel's application to the SP, whose counsel filed preliminary written observations on 29 January 1992 and full observations on 30 March 1992, in which they first requested a hearing or, at the very least, leave to make further submissions orally. The Constitutional Court acceded to the latter request only and heard the party Chairman, Mr Perinçek, on 12 May, who had ceased to be Chairman of the party a short time before."", ""Before the Constitutional Court the SP's representatives firstly contested the constitutionality of certain provisions of Law no. 2820 on which Principal State Counsel relied. They also argued that the court should not admit the SP's publications (see paragraph 13 above) in evidence against that party. They said that two of the publications were copies of a speech made by Mr Perinçek before his election as party Chairman on 6 July 1991; furthermore, they had been examined by the National Security Courts and found not to contravene the law (see paragraph 11 above)."", ""The party representatives went on to point out that on 8 December 1988 the Constitutional Court had dismissed the first application to have the SP dissolved on the basis of its programme (see paragraph 10 above). They maintained that the court would be contradicting itself if it now decided to dissolve the SP purely because of Mr Perinçek's oral statements, which, in the case before the court, were merely reiterations of paragraph 31 of the programme, which had already been reviewed by the Constitutional Court. They noted, lastly, that since the enactment of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) which had, in particular, repealed Article 142 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below), it was no longer illegal to carry on Marxist-Leninist activities; in their submission, if one political party was treated differently from the others, the aim pursued by the Turkish legislature would be defeated."", '15. Pursuant to section 101 of Law no. 2820, the Constitutional Court made an order on 10 July 1992 dissolving the SP, which entailed ipso jure the liquidation of the party and the transfer of its assets to the Treasury, in accordance with section 107 of that Law. The order was published in the Official Gazette on 25 October 1992. As a consequence, the founders and managers of the party were banned from holding similar office in any other political body (former Article 69 of the Constitution – see paragraph 16 below).', 'In its judgment the Constitutional Court noted at the outset that the impugned publications of the SP bore the name and signature of its Chairman, Mr Perinçek, who was also the person who had made the oral statements on television. Those publications and statements accordingly also bound the SP and consequently were admissible as relevant evidence under section 101 of Law no. 2820.', ""The Constitutional Court did not consider that either its or the National Security Courts' earlier judgments (see paragraphs 10–11 above) in any way affected its examination of the case before it, which concerned the political activities of the party, not of its leaders. Moreover, it could not accept that the fact that a provision of the Criminal Code making it an offence to behave in a certain way had been repealed meant that similar conduct no longer constituted a valid ground for dissolution under Law no. 2820."", 'The Constitutional Court observed that unlike the issue that had been decided in its judgment of 8 December 1988, the one now before it was based on new facts and evidence and thus gave rise to a different question in law. It no longer had to be determined whether the programme and constitution of the SP were in conformity with the law, but solely whether its political activities were caught by the relevant prohibitions.', 'In reaching its decision on the merits, the Constitutional Court noted, inter alia, that the SP referred in its political message to two nations: the Kurdish nation and the Turkish nation. But it could not be accepted that there were two nations within the Republic of Turkey, whose citizens, whatever their ethnic origin, had Turkish nationality. In reality, the statements made by the SP concerning Kurdish national and cultural rights were intended to create minorities and, ultimately, the establishment of a Kurdish-Turkish federation, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the Turkish State.', 'Like all nationals of foreign descent, nationals of Kurdish origin could freely express their identity, but the Constitution and the law precluded them from forming a separate nation and State. The SP was ideologically opposed to the nationalism of Atatürk, which was the most fundamental principle underpinning the Republic of Turkey.', ""The SP's political activity was also incompatible in aim with Articles 11 and 17 of the European Convention on Human Rights, since it was similar to that of terrorist organisations, notwithstanding a difference in the means employed."", 'In short, objectives which, like those of the SP, encouraged separatism and incited a socially integrated community to fight for the creation of an independent federated State were unacceptable and justified dissolution of the party concerned.']","['ii. relevant domestic law', 'The Constitution', '16.

The full text of the Commission's opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [7]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '22.

The applicants asked the Court to hold that there had been a breach of the rights guaranteed by the aforementioned provisions of the Convention and Protocol No. 1.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11 OF THE CONVENTION', '24. The applicants maintained that the fact that the Socialist Party (“the SP”) had been dissolved and its leaders banned from holding similar office in any other political party had infringed their right to freedom of association, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2.

Submissions of those appearing before the Court', '(a) The applicants', '25. The applicants maintained that there was no doubt that political parties came within the ambit of Article 11.', '(b) The Government', ""26. In their memorial the Government submitted that Article 11 did not in any event apply to political parties. Where in its constitution or programme a party attacked a State's constitutional order, the Court should declare the Convention to be inapplicable ratione materiae or apply Article 17."", ""27. The SP had intended through its activities unambiguously to break with Turkey's fundamental constitutional principles. It was apparent from what the SP said that the party considered that citizens of Kurdish origin had “nation” and “people” status and the right to “found a separate State”, that it advocated the setting up of a federation, without moreover excluding the creation of other federated bodies entitled to open consulates in other countries. As that amounted to challenging the very basis of the State, the Constitutional Court had had to review the constitutionality of that political aim. In so doing, it had followed the line taken by the German Constitutional Court in its judgment of 31 October 1991 on the right of foreign nationals to vote in local elections and by the French Constitutional Council in its decision of 9 May 1991 on the status of Corsica."", ""In the Government's submission, the States Parties to the Convention had at no stage intended to submit their constitutional institutions, and in particular the principles they considered to be the essential conditions of their existence, to review by the Strasbourg institutions. For that reason, where a political party such as the SP had called those institutions or principles into question, it could not seek application of the Convention or its Protocols, since it was not the SP's freedom of association that was in issue in the present case, but the right to self-determination, which did not come within the compass of the Convention."", ""At the very least, Article 17 of the Convention should be applied in respect of the SP since the party sought to justify the use of violence and to promote hatred of the Turkish State and the wrongful division of an entire people into two opposing camps. In so doing, the SP had said the same things as the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (“the PKK”), without distancing itself from any of the latter's methods. Moreover, the Constitutional Court had, in its judgment ordering the dissolution of the SP, recognised that Article 17 was relevant in the case of the SP and concluded that the party's activities were covered by that provision."", '(c) The Commission', '28. The Commission expressed the opinion that there was nothing in the wording of Article 11 to limit its scope to a particular form of association or group or to suggest that it did not apply to political parties. On the contrary, if Article 11 was considered to be a legal safeguard that ensured the proper functioning of democracy, political parties were one of the most important forms of association it protected. In that connection, the Commission referred to a number of decisions in which it had examined, under Article 11, various restrictions on the activities of political parties and even the dissolution of such parties, thereby implicitly accepting that Article 11 applied to that type of association (see the German Communist Party case, application no. 250/57, Yearbook 1, p. 225; the Greek case, Yearbook 12, p. 170, § 392; the France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands v. Turkey case, applications nos. 9940–9944/82, Decisions and Reports 35, p. 143).', ""At the hearing before the Court the Delegate of the Commission also said that it was unnecessary to apply Article 17 of the Convention, since neither the SP's programme nor the statements made by Mr Perinçek that were in issue indicated that they had sought to destroy the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention."", ""2. The Court's assessment"", '29. In its judgment in the case of United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, the Court held that political parties are a form of association essential to the proper functioning of democracy and that in view of the importance of democracy in the Convention system, there can be no doubt that political parties come within the scope of Article 11. The Court noted on the other hand that an association, including a political party, is not excluded from the protection afforded by the Convention simply because its activities are regarded by the national authorities as undermining the constitutional structures of the State and calling for the imposition of restrictions (see the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 17, §§ 25 and 27). The Court sees no reason to come to a different conclusion in the instant case.', 'As to the application of Article 17, the Court will deal with it after considering the question of compliance with Article 11 (see paragraph 53 below).', 'B. Compliance with Article 11', 'Whether there was an interference', ""30. All those appearing before the Court acknowledged that the SP's dissolution amounted to an interference in the three applicants' right to freedom of association. That is also the Court's view."", '2. Whether the interference was justified', '31. Such an interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims.', '(a) “Prescribed by law”', '32. It was common ground that the interference was “prescribed by law”, as the measures ordered by the Constitutional Court were based on Articles 2, 3 § 1, 6, 10 § 1 and 14 § 1 and former Article 68 of the Constitution and sections 78, 81 and 96(3) of Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties (see paragraphs 16–17 above).', '(b) Legitimate aim', '33. The Government maintained that the interference pursued a number of legitimate aims: ensuring national security, public safety and territorial integrity and protecting the rights and freedoms of others. If the Court had accepted, as it had done in the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment of 16 December 1992 (Series A no. 252), that an isolated case of espionage could harm national security, there was all the more reason to reach a similar conclusion where, as in the instant case, the very existence of a State Party to the Convention was threatened.', '34. The applicants observed that before the Constitutional Court Principal State Counsel had at no stage relied on either national security or public safety.', ""35. The Commission considered that prohibiting activities which, in the authorities' view, were likely to cause the collapse of the State or the division of its territory could be said to be intended to protect “national security” and territorial integrity."", '36. The Court considers that the dissolution of the SP pursued at least one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 11: the protection of “national security”.', '(c) “Necessary in a democratic society”', 'i. Submissions of those appearing before the Court', '(α) The applicants', '37. The applicants said that in a pluralist democratic and parliamentary system, people should have the right to express their opinion on the Kurdish problem and on how to resolve it. The SP was a political party supported by a sector of public opinion which should have had the right to accede to power.', ""The SP bore no resemblance to the German Communist Party that had been dissolved at the time by the German Federal Constitutional Court (see application no. 250/57, Yearbook 1, p. 225). Otherwise, the Turkish Constitutional Court would not have dismissed, on 8 December 1988, the first application for the SP to be dissolved (see paragraph 10 above). In that decision the Constitutional Court had found the party's constitution and programme to be in accordance with the Constitution and that it was part of the country's democratic system and clearly opposed terrorism."", ""The SP had never acted unlawfully and the best proof of that was that its then Chairman, Mr Perinçek, was now Chairman of another political party, the Workers' Party, and carried on his work quite lawfully."", 'The SP had always defended the union of the Turkish State. The federal system it proposed as a solution to the Kurdish problem would not prevent State unity. Germany and Switzerland were federations and no one saw in that status a programme to divide those countries. As for Turkey, federation would, on the contrary, afford a much more reliable solution for the future.', '(β) The Government', ""38. In the Government's submission, any resemblance between the present case and that of the United Communist Party of Turkey (“the TBKP”) was in appearances only, the sole real similarity lying in the fact that both parties had been dissolved by an order of the Constitutional Court. In the case of the TBKP the Constitutional Court's task had been to assess whether the party's programme and constitution complied with the Constitution and the Law on the regulation of political parties. In the case of the SP on the other hand – as the Constitutional Court had clearly explained in its judgment – the court had had to assess whether the SP's activities subsequent to its formation were consistent with those documents."", ""After the first review of the constitutionality of the party (see paragraphs 9–10 above), new facts and evidence had come to light concerning the SP's activities, which the Commission, unlike the Constitutional Court, had failed to take into account. They showed that from 1990, and in particular in 1991, the SP's activities had shifted radically away from its initial approach reflected in its constitutive documents and were directed towards the disruption of the fundamental concepts which have inspired the Republic of Turkey since its formation."", ""The shift was to be seen in particular in the speeches made by the SP's Chairman, Mr Perinçek, at meetings, congresses or political rallies, some of which were later published by the party. He had used violent, aggressive and provocative language, denigrated all the other political parties and sought to vindicate the use of violence and terrorist methods by calling for an uprising through the use, inter alia, of the expression “ Ayağa kalk ”, which meant “stand up”. The Constitutional Court consequently found that the language and methods of the SP were not at all consistent with its calls for brotherhood and equality."", ""39. Referring to the Court's analysis of the situation in Turkey in its judgment in the case of Zana v. Turkey of 25 November 1997 ( Reports 1997-VII), the Government said that in 1990 and 1991 there had been an intolerable increase in terrorist activity that had caused thousands of deaths and had spared neither women nor children. Against that background, the declarations of a well-known political leader were bound to aggravate the violence and hatred. In such cases, the authority to the effect that freedom of expression also applied to statements that offended, shocked or disturbed bore no relevance. In the present case, the Court was not concerned with a political debate on political and economic issues of interest to the whole country, but with incitement to join a bloody and murderous conflict between two sections of the population which enjoyed, without any discrimination, all the rights and liberties defined by the Constitution and statute."", ""In that connection, the Government referred, as they had done in the TBKP case (see the judgment cited above, pp. 23–24, § 49), to the Commission's case-law whereby if the interference pursued as a legitimate aim the protection of public order, territorial integrity, the public interest or democracy, the Convention institutions did not require that the risk of violence justifying the interference should be real, current or imminent."", ""Nor was it at all relevant to rely on Mr Perinçek's acquittals before the National Security Courts in order to contest the necessity of the interference in issue, as two types of proceedings, pursuing entirely different aims, were involved: the first type was criminal proceedings, in which the court ruled on an individual's personal responsibility, whereas in the second type of proceedings – constitutional proceedings, such as those impugned before the Court – the sole issue was whether a political party was compatible with the Convention and that necessitated applying different criteria."", '(γ) The Commission', ""40. The Commission considered that the SP's dissolution had not been necessary in a democratic society. It noted that Mr Perinçek had previously been prosecuted in the criminal courts for making statements to the same effect as those made in the present case, but had been acquitted of the charges against him. The Commission inferred that even in the eyes of the Turkish judicial authorities, the publications did not contain anything intended to encourage extremist or terrorist groups to destroy the constitutional order of the State or to found a Kurdish State through the use of force."", ""The Commission also observed that the SP had sought to achieve its political aims solely through lawful means and that it had not been shown that the SP had had any intention of destroying Turkey's democratic and pluralist order or had advocated infringing fundamental human rights by promoting racial discrimination."", ""ii. The Court's assessment"", '41. The Court reiterates that notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 must also be considered in the light of Article 10. The protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms of assembly and association as enshrined in Article 11. That applies all the more in relation to political parties in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy.', 'As the Court has emphasised many times, there can be no democracy without pluralism. It is for that reason that freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 is applicable, subject to paragraph 2, not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. The fact that their activities form part of a collective exercise of freedom of expression in itself entitles political parties to seek the protection of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. (see, among other authorities, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, pp. 20–21, §§ 42–43).', ""42. In the instant case it must first be noted that in its judgment of 10 July 1992 the Constitutional Court held that on that occasion it no longer had to consider whether the SP's programme and constitution were lawful, but only whether its political activities contravened the statutory prohibitions. In dissolving the party, the Constitutional Court had had regard to public statements – some of them in written form – made by Mr Perinçek which it considered to constitute new facts and evidence that were binding on the SP (see paragraph 15 above). Consequently, the Court may confine itself to examining those statements."", ""43. The Constitutional Court noted that, by distinguishing two nations –the Kurdish nation and the Turkish nation – Mr Perinçek had advocated the creation of minorities within Turkey and, ultimately, the establishment of a Kurdish-Turkish federation, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the State. The SP was ideologically opposed to the nationalism of Atatürk, which was the most fundamental principle underpinning the Republic of Turkey. Although different methods were used, the aim of the SP's political activity was similar to that of terrorist organisations. As the SP promoted separatism and revolt its dissolution was justified (see paragraph 15 above)."", '44. In the light of these factors, the Court must firstly consider the content of the statements in issue and then determine whether they justified the dissolution of the SP.', 'With regard to the first issue the Court reiterates that when it carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 22, § 47).', ""45. Further, the Court has previously held that one of the principal characteristics of democracy is the possibility it offers of resolving a country's problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome. Democracy thrives on freedom of expression. From that point of view, there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State's population and to take part in the nation's political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned (see the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 57)."", ""46. Having analysed Mr Perinçek's statements, the Court finds nothing in them that can be considered a call for the use of violence, an uprising or any other form of rejection of democratic principles. On the contrary, he stressed on a number of occasions the need to achieve the proposed political reform in accordance with democratic rules, through the ballot box and by holding referenda. At the same time, he spoke out against “the former culture idolising violence and advocating the use of force to solve problems between nations and in society” (see paragraph 13 above)."", ""At the hearing the Agent for the Government stated that Mr Perinçek had “justified the use of violent and terrorist methods” by saying in particular: “The Kurd has proved himself through the fight of impoverished peasants by linking its destiny [to theirs]. By holding meetings with thousands of people in the towns and provinces, the Kurd had proved himself and broken down the barriers of fear.” Furthermore, by calling on those present to “sow courage, rather than watermelons”, Mr Perinçek had, in the Government's submission, “exhorted them to stop all activities other than the destruction of order”. Lastly, by using the phrase “The Kurdish people are standing up” he had called upon them to revolt."", 'While the Court accepts that these phrases were directed at citizens of Kurdish origin and constituted an invitation to them to rally together and assert certain political claims, it finds no trace of any incitement to use violence or infringe the rules of democracy. In that regard, the relevant statements were scarcely any different from those made by other political groups that were active in other countries of the Council of Europe.', '47. The Constitutional Court had also criticised Mr Perinçek for having drawn a distinction between two nations, the Kurdish nation and the Turkish nation, in his speeches and of thereby pleading in favour of creating minorities and the establishment of a Kurdish-Turkish federation, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the State. Ultimately, the SP had advocated separatism.', ""The Court notes that, read together, the statements put forward a political programme with the essential aim being the establishment, in accordance with democratic rules, of a federal system in which Turks and Kurds would be represented on an equal footing and on a voluntary basis. Admittedly, reference is made to the right to self-determination of the “Kurdish nation” and its right to “secede”; however, read in their context, the statements using these words do not encourage secession from Turkey but seek rather to stress that the proposed federal system could not come about without the Kurds' freely given consent, which should be expressed through a referendum."", ""In the Court's view, the fact that such a political programme is considered incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Turkish State does not make it incompatible with the rules of democracy. It is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself."", ""48. It is true here too that, as was the case with the TBKP (see the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 58), it cannot be ruled out that the statements in issue concealed objectives and intentions different from the ones proclaimed in public. In the absence of concrete actions belying Mr Perinçek's sincerity in what he said, however, that sincerity should not be doubted. The SP was thus penalised for conduct relating solely to the exercise of freedom of expression."", ""49. The Court also notes that Mr Perinçek was acquitted in the National Security Courts where he had been prosecuted in respect of the same statements (see paragraph 11 above). In that connection the Government stressed that the two types of proceedings were entirely different, one concerning the application of criminal law, the other the application of constitutional law. The Court merely notes that the Turkish courts had divergent views as to the effect of Mr Perinçek's statements."", ""It is now important to determine whether, in the light of the above considerations, the SP's dissolution can be considered to have been necessary in a democratic society, that is to say whether it met a “pressing social need” and was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” (see, among many other authorities and mutatis mutandis, the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 25–26, § 52)."", ""50. The Court reiterates that, having regard to the essential role of political parties in the proper functioning of democracy (see the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 17, § 25), the exceptions set out in Article 11 are, where political parties are concerned, to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on such parties' freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts (see the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 22, § 46)."", '51. The Court observes that the interference in question was radical: the SP was dissolved with immediate and permanent effect, its assets were liquidated and transferred ipso jure to the Treasury and its leaders – who admittedly did not include Mr Perinçek when the party was dissolved (see paragraph 14 above) – were banned from carrying on certain similar political activities. Measures as severe as those may only be applied in the most serious cases.', ""52. The Court has already noted that Mr Perinçek's statements, though critical and full of demands, did not appear to it to call into question the need for compliance with democratic principles and rules."", 'The Court is prepared to take into account the background of cases before it, in particular the difficulties associated with the prevention of terrorism (see, among other authorities, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 59). In the present case, however, it has not been established how, in spite of the fact that in making them their author declared attachment to democracy and expressed rejection of violence, the statements in issue could be considered to have been in any way responsible for the problems which terrorism poses in Turkey.', '53. In view of the findings referred to above, there is no need either to bring Article 17 into play, as nothing in the statements warrants the conclusion that their author relied on the Convention to engage in activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in it (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 60).', '54. In conclusion, the dissolution of the SP was disproportionate to the aim pursued and consequently unnecessary in a democratic society. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONs OF ARTICLES 9, 10, 14 AND 18 OF THE CONVENTION', '55. The applicants also maintained that there had been breaches of Articles 9, 10, 14 and 18 of the Convention. As their complaints relate to the same facts the Court considers it unnecessary to examine them separately.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATIONs OF ARTICLES 1 AND 3 OF PROTOCOL No. 1', ""56. The applicants further submitted that the effects of the SP's dissolution – its assets were confiscated and transferred to the Treasury, and its leaders were banned from taking part in elections – entailed a breach of Articles 1 and 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provide:"", 'Article 1', '“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.', 'The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”', 'Article 3', '“The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”', ""57. The Court notes that the measures complained of by the applicants were incidental effects of the SP's dissolution, which the Court has held to amount to a breach of Article 11. It is consequently unnecessary to consider those complaints separately."", 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF Article 6 § 1 OF the Convention', '58. Lastly, the applicants complained that instead of holding a public hearing, the Constitutional Court had heard them merely in camera and that they had not had access to the case file or the verbatim record of the hearing. They considered that that amounted to a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.', '59. Neither the Government nor the Commission considered that Article 6 § 1 was applicable on the facts of the case.', '60. In view of its conclusion concerning compliance with Article 11, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine this complaint.', 'V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION', '61. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Annulment of the order for dissolution', ""62. The applicants firstly requested the annulment of the Constitutional Court's order of 10 July 1992 dissolving the SP. They also sought “recognised political-party status” for the SP."", '63. The Court holds that it has no jurisdiction under the Convention to order these measures (see, mutatis mutandis, the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 57, § 47).', 'B. Damage and costs and expenses', '64. In respect of pecuniary damage the applicants claimed 1,500,000 US dollars (USD): USD 1,000,000 for the SP and USD 250,000 each for Mr Doğu Perinçek and Mr İlhan Kırıt. They sought USD 6,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage, that is USD 2,000,000 for each applicant.', 'In support of their claims they stressed that the SP had had more than 400 offices spread over the whole of Turkey, all its assets had been seized, it had had the right to present candidates at the elections, had taken part in the elections and was the only left-wing socialist party in existence when it was dissolved. According to the applicants, the thousands of people who had helped to form the SP – which had been active for four years before its dissolution – and the leaders of that party had sustained substantial non-pecuniary damage and financial loss.', ""The applicants also sought “reimbursement of all the costs to which the case had given rise”. At the hearing before the Court, they explained that the fees and costs of the 308 lawyers who had represented the SP before the Constitutional Court alone had come to 1,955,800 French francs (FRF). As to the costs of the applicants' representation before the Convention institutions, they had come to FRF 300,000."", ""65. As its main submission, the Government considered that no compensation was payable in this case. In the alternative, they considered the applicants' claims exorbitant. In the further alternative, they argued that a violation of Article 11 only could not confer on the applicants a right to be compensated individually."", ""As to the alleged pecuniary damage, the Government affirmed that it had no causal link with the SP's dissolution, that political parties and their leaders could not be equated with commercial undertakings and that in any event there was no supporting accounting evidence for the claims."", 'As for the claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government considered them to be “even more unreliable” since not only were they exorbitant but they included a claim for non-pecuniary damage allegedly sustained by the SP itself.', 'Lastly, as regards the claims for costs and expenses, the Government found them to be insufficiently detailed.', ""66. The Delegate of the Commission submitted that the applicants' presentation – which was very general and hypothetical – was insufficient to allow their claims under Article 50 to be upheld."", '67. The Court notes that the applicants have not furnished any evidence in support of their claims for substantial sums in respect of pecuniary damage and costs and expenses. Consequently, it cannot uphold those claims (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium judgment of 3 July 1997 ( Article 50 ), Reports 1997-IV, p. 1299, § 24). It notes, however, that the applicants received FRF 57,187 in legal aid paid by the Council of Europe.', ""As to non-pecuniary damage, the Court notes that, unlike the TBKP, the SP's constitution and programme were approved by the Constitutional Court and the party was active for four years before being dissolved by it. Mr Perinçek and Mr Kırıt therefore sustained definite non-pecuniary damage. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court assesses that damage at FRF 50,000 each."", 'C. Default interest', '68. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.36% per annum.']",2,tr,001-58172,0

Mr İbrahim Incal, a Turkish national born in 1953, lives in İzmir. A lawyer by profession, he was at the material time a member of the executive committee of the İzmir section of the People’s Labour Party (“the HEP”). That party, which was represented in the National Assembly, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 14 July 1993.', '10. On 1 July 1992 the executive committee decided to distribute in the İzmir constituency a leaflet criticising the measures taken by the local authorities, in particular against small-scale illegal trading and the sprawl of squatters’ camps around the city.', 'The title of the leaflet, of which ten thousand copies were printed, was “To all democratic patriots!”, and the text read as follows:', '“In the last few days a campaign aimed at ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT OF THE CITIES’ has been launched in İzmir against the Kurdish population by a combination of prefecture, security police and town hall. In this campaign İzmir has been designated a pilot-city. The first stage was the operation [against] street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers, whom they tried to hide away on the ground that it was necessary to smarten up the city and ease traffic congestion. The purpose of this operation was to impose an ‘economic blockade’ on our, mainly Kurdish, fellow citizens who make their living through these activities, condemning them to destitution and starvation. In this way the masses were to be frightened, oppressed and compelled to return to their province of origin.', 'Before the ‘DRIVING THE KURDS OUT’ campaign began the organisational and psychological ground had already been prepared by leaflets signed by ‘Patriotic inhabitants of İzmir’ and handed out in large numbers for weeks by ‘obscure forces’. These leaflets incited hostility against the Kurdish population in particular and stirred up anti-Kurdish feelings. This led to racist and chauvinistic anti-Kurdish attitudes through propaganda saying: ‘Don’t give employment or housing to the Kurds. Don’t speak to them, don’t let your daughters marry them and don’t marry one yourself. Smash the Kurds.’ That is how the psychological foundations were laid down, the preparations for the future offensives. Although these leaflets were handed out in broad daylight, those responsible – and nobody knows why – were never arrested.', 'But the campaign was by no means limited to the operation against street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers. The second prong was ‘Operation shantytown’. The same combination of prefecture, security police and town hall launched the demolition of the squatters’ camps. It began in Yamanlar and Şemikler and continued in Gaziemir, [all] shantytown districts inhabited mainly by Kurds, who, before the elections, were regarded by the parties in favour of the status quo as a source of votes. Those who had encouraged the mushrooming of the shantytowns by dishonestly promising freedom to build in exchange for votes and those who, with the local mafia, had appropriated public land this time set about the ferocious destruction of these huts to oppress and intimidate the Kurds and force them to go back home.', 'The Kurdish and Turkish proletarian people suddenly and without any warning saw the huts they had run into debt to build, with so many sacrifices made by cutting down on their children’s food, collapsing about their ears. That is how they are trying to oppress the Kurdish and Turkish people and drive them into distress and despair.', 'IT’S STATE TERROR AGAINST TURKISH AND KURDISH PROLETARIANS!', 'It is certain that these demolitions, which began in Yamanlar and are still continuing in Gaziemir, will soon spread to İzmir’s other shantytowns. The State is testing the people’s reactions and will to resist by causing various kinds of destruction. Passivity as a form of defence against this devastation has encouraged the State to commit further kinds of destruction.', 'In conclusion: The ‘Driving-the-Kurds-Out policy’ forms part of the SPECIAL WAR being conducted in the country at present against the Kurdish people. It is one of the mechanisms of that war, the way it impinges on the cities. Because the methods used are the same, namely enslavement, violence, terror and oppression through compulsion. It is a psychological war.', 'While, in the country, they are trying to oppress and silence the people through counter-insurgency tactics, special patrols, village guards, the SS [3] decree and every [other] form of State terror, in İzmir they want to achieve the same aim by depriving our fellow citizens of their means of subsistence and in the end by knocking their houses down about their ears. The methods used, although different in form, are in the final analysis mechanisms serving the purposes of the special war. It is the urban form of the special war.', 'TO ALL DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS!', 'The way to nullify these insults to the cities is to set up NEIGHBOURHOOD COMMITTEES BASED ON THE PEOPLE’S OWN STRENGTH.', 'We call on all Kurdish and Turkish democratic patriots to assume their responsibilities and oppose this special war being waged against the proletarian people.', 'LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS!', 'STOP THE SPECIAL WAR BEING SPREAD INTO THE CITIES!”', '11. By a letter of 2 July 1992, accompanied by a copy of the leaflet in question, the president of the HEP informed the İzmir prefecture of the executive committee’s decision (see paragraph 10 above) and asked for permission to implement it.', '12. The İzmir security police, to whom this request had been referred, considered that the leaflet contained separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences.', 'On 3 July 1992 they asked the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the İzmir National Security Court (“the public prosecutor”, “the National Security Court”) to state his opinion as to whether the contents of the leaflet contravened the law.', '13. On the same day, at the request of the public prosecutor’s office, a substitute judge of the National Security Court issued an injunction ordering the seizure of the leaflets and prohibiting their distribution.', 'The police searched the HEP’s premises in İzmir, first at the headquarters, where the party leaders handed over, without demur, nine thousand copies of the leaflet which were still parcelled up, and then at the Buca district office, where the thousand remaining copies were seized.', '14. Still on 3 July 1992 the public prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation against the HEP’s local leaders and the members of its executive committee, including the applicant.', '15. On 27 July 1992 the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the National Security Court against the applicant and the other eight members of the HEP committee who had taken part in the decision of 1 July 1992 (see paragraph 10 above). Citing the text of the leaflet, he accused them of attempting to incite hatred and hostility through racist words and asked the court to apply Articles 312 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and additional section 4 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 below). He also asked the court to order confiscation of the leaflets.', '16. On 9 February 1993 the National Security Court, composed of three judges, one of whom was a member of the Military Legal Service, found the applicant guilty of the offences charged and sentenced him to six months and twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of 55,555 Turkish liras. It also ordered the confiscation of the leaflets and disqualified him from driving for fifteen days.', 'In its interpretation of the wording of the leaflet, the National Security Court accepted the public prosecutor’s oral submissions entirely, except for that part which related to the applicability of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). It noted in particular that the leaflet suggested recourse to resistance against the police and the establishment of “neighbourhood committees”, which it held to be illegal forms of protest. It further held that the offence had been intentionally committed, since the accused had not contested either the existence or wording of the text on which the charge was based.', 'With regard to the severity of the sentence, it observed that although commission of the offence through the medium of print was an aggravating circumstance, it was necessary to take into account the accused’s good faith and the fact that the authorities had been able to lay hands on the leaflets before they had been distributed.', '17. On 9 March 1993 the applicant and the other convicted persons appealed to the Court of Cassation. In their notice of appeal they asked for a public hearing to be held and challenged the National Security Court’s interpretation of the leaflet and its refusal to commute the prison sentence to a fine.', '18. On 20 May the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation forwarded the case file together with an opinion couched in a standard form of words – which was not communicated to Mr Incal – asking the court to uphold the judgment.', '19. In a judgment of 6 July 1993 the Court of Cassation upheld all the operative provisions of the impugned judgment, after observing that, regard being had to the nature and length of the sentence imposed at first instance, it was not necessary to hold a hearing.', '20. On 23 August 1993 the prosecuting authorities decided, at the applicant’s request, to stay execution of the prison sentence for four months.']","['ii. relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. Criminal law', '1. The Criminal Code', '21. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:', 'Article 311 § 2', '“Public incitement to commit an offence', 'Where the incitement [to commit an offence] is done by means of mass communication, of whatever type, by tape recordings, gramophone records, newspapers, press publications or other published material, by the circulation or distribution of printed papers or by the placing of placards or posters in public places, the terms of imprisonment to which convicted persons are liable shall be doubled…”', 'Article 312', '“Non-public incitement to commit an offence', 'Whosoever expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall be sentenced to between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment and a … fine of between six thousand and thirty thousand liras.', 'Whosoever expressly arouses hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races or religions, or one based on allegiance to a particular denomination or region, shall be sentenced to between one and three years’ imprisonment and a fine of between nine thousand and thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement is done in a manner likely to endanger public safety, the sentence shall be increased [by one third to one half].', 'The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the above-mentioned offences by the means listed in Article 311 § 2 shall be doubled.”', '22. A conviction under Article 312 § 2 entails further consequences, particularly with regard to the exercise of certain activities governed by special legislation. For example, persons convicted of an offence under that section may not found associations (Law no. 2908, section 4(2)(b)) or trade unions, nor may they be members of the executive committee of a trade union (Law no. 2929, section 5). They are also forbidden to found or join political parties (Law no. 2820, section 11(5)) and may not stand for election to Parliament (Law no. 2839, section 11(f3)). In addition, if the sentence imposed exceeds six months’ imprisonment, the convicted person is debarred from entering the civil service, provided that the offence has been committed intentionally (Law no. 657, section 48(5)).', '2. The Press Act (Law no. 5680)', '23. Additional section 4(1) of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) provides:', '“Where distribution [of the printed matter whose distribution constitutes the offence] is prevented … by a court injunction or, in an emergency, by order of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to be confirmed by a court, … the penalty imposed shall be one-third of that laid down by law for the offence concerned.”', '3. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713)', '24. Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991, promulgated with a view to preventing acts of terrorism, refers to a number of offences defined in the Criminal Code which it describes as “acts of terrorism” or “acts perpetrated for the purposes of terrorism” (sections 3 and 4) and to which it applies. However, the act punishable pursuant to Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 above) is not among them.', '4. The Code of Criminal Procedure', '25. Article 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the holding of a public hearing in proceedings before the Court of Cassation only where the impugned judgment concerns offences classified as “serious”, such as those punishable by the death penalty or a term of imprisonment of more than ten years. The Court of Cassation’s jurisdiction, according to Article 307 of the Code, is limited to questions concerning the lawfulness and procedural regularity of the first-instance judgment.', 'B. The National Security Courts', '26. The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11 July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That Law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage:', '“There may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to [give judgment on] a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have [thus] been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence …, they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.”', 'The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules.', '1.

Case-law', '1. The Supreme Military Administrative Court', '32. The Government produced several judgments of the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court setting aside decisions concerning the appointment and promotion of military judges or disciplinary sanctions applied to them. These were the judgments of 31 May 1988 (no. 1988/185), 14 December 1993 (no. 1993/1116), 22 December 1993 (no. 1993/1119), 19 November 1996 (no. 1996/950), 1 April 1997 (no. 1997/262), 27 May 1997 (no. 1997/405) and 3 July 1997 (no. 1997/62).', 'It appears from these judgments that in setting aside the transfer decisions concerned, the First Division gave as its grounds either lack of consent on the part of the person concerned or abuse of the military authorities’ discretionary power. In connection with assessment reports, failure to state reasons or a lack of objectivity on the part of the immediate superior was taken into account. Lastly, in connection with a disciplinary sanction, against which in principle no appeal lies, the First Division held that the acts of which the person concerned stood accused had been incorrectly established and that the sanction was accordingly null and void.', '2. The National Security Courts', '33. The Government also submitted a number of judgments rendered by National Security Courts relevant to the impartiality of military judges sitting as members of such courts. These were the judgments of 12 September 1995 (no. 1995/171), 27 February 1996 (no. 1996/38), 7 March 1996 (no. 1996/55), 21 March 1996 (no. 1996/70), 2 April 1996 (no. 1996/102), 9 April 1996 (no. 1996/112), 2 May 1996 (no. 1996/141), 9 May 1996 (no. 1996/150), 19 August 1996 (no. 1996/250), 12 September 1996 (no. 1996/258), 19 September 1996 (no. 1996/263), 1 October 1996 (no. 1996/270), 3 October 1996 (no. 1996/273), 8 October 1996 (no. 1996/278), 12 June 1997 (no. 1997/128) and 15 July 1997 (no. 1997/393).', 'Most of these decisions declared the accused guilty but also contained separate opinions by military judges adopting a dissenting opinion with regard to the establishment and classification of the facts, the way sentence was determined or the finding of guilt itself.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '34. Mr Incal applied to the Commission on 7 September 1993. He asserted that he had not had a fair trial in the National Security Court, firstly because it could not be regarded as an independent tribunal, and secondly because it had refused to commute his sentence of imprisonment into a fine on account of his political opinions (Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taken separately and in conjunction with Article 14). He also submitted that by rejecting his request for leave to appear and by omitting to send him a copy of the Principal Public Prosecutor’s opinion on his appeal on points of law the Court of Cassation had breached Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b). He further alleged that his conviction for helping to prepare a political leaflet constituted a breach of Articles 9 and 10 and that his temporary disqualification from driving was a degrading punishment contrary to Article 3.', '35. On 16 October 1995 the Commission declared inadmissible the complaint relating to the applicant’s disqualification from driving and declared the remainder of the application (no. 22678/93) admissible. In its report of 25 February 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion', '(a) that there had been a violation of Article 10 (unanimously);', '(b) that, contrary to Article 6 § 1, the applicant had not had a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal (unanimously);', '(c) that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 (unanimously);', '(d) that the fact that the applicant had been unable to reply to the public prosecutor’s opinion had breached Article 6 § 1 (twenty-six votes to five); and', '(e) that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 on account of the fact that the applicant had not appeared in the Court of Cassation (twenty-six votes to five).', 'The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the partly dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '36. In their memorial, and later at the hearing, the Government asked the Court to hold that the proceedings complained of had not infringed the rights secured to the applicant by Articles 6, 10 and 14 of the Convention.', '37. The applicant asked the Court to hold that Article 6 § 1, Article 9 and Article 10 of the Convention had been breached and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'as to the law', 'I. Alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention', '38. Mr Incal submitted that his criminal conviction on account of his contribution to preparation of the leaflet in issue had infringed his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Commission accepted this argument, which the Government contested.', 'A. Existence of an interference', '39. The participants in the proceedings agreed that the applicant’s conviction amounted to an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. That is also the Court’s opinion.', 'B. Justification of the interference', '40. Such interference breaches Article 10 except where it is “prescribed by law”, is directed towards one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 § 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve the aim or aims concerned.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '41. The participants in the proceedings all accepted that the interference was “prescribed by law”, as the applicant’s conviction had been based on Article 312 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code and additional section 4(1) of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above).', '2. Legitimate aim', '42. The Court notes that no argument was presented on this point by the parties to the case. The Commission took the view that in applying Article 312 of the Criminal Code the Turkish courts’ aim in the present case had been to prevent disorder.', 'The Court considers that Mr Incal’s conviction pursued at least one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 10, namely “the prevention of disorder”.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) Arguments of the participants', '( i ) The applicant', '43. The applicant submitted that in a pluralist democratic system political parties such as his ought to be able to express their views on the country’s social and political problems. The opinions expressed in the leaflet in issue were based on actual events and were limited to criticism of the discriminatory administrative and economic pressure brought to bear on citizens of Kurdish origin. The authors of the leaflet, of whom he was one, had never intended to advocate separatism and did not seek to foment disorder.', 'Contrary to the findings of the judges at his trial, it was not a factual description of the situation in a country which provoked hatred and hostility but the fact that it was not possible for reactions to problems of general interest to be submitted to the public by the political parties.', 'Mr Incal challenged the necessity of the interference and emphasised the fact that the leaflets in question had not been distributed. In any event, the penalty had been completely disproportionate, especially as his conviction had led to his being permanently debarred from the civil service and from certain activities within associations, trade unions or political organisations, in the latter case in the capacity of leader, founder member, parliamentary candidate, mayor or town councillor.', '(ii) The Government', '44. The Government asserted that, despite the anger expressed in the leaflet concerned, the operations aimed at closing down booths unlawfully erected on land belonging to others and driving out street traders met the requirements of the relevant legislation and regulations, which had no other purpose than the prevention of disorder and the protection of the rights of others. However, in the racial perspective of the leaflet prepared by the applicant, who was then a member of the HEP, a party working in favour of Kurdish separatism, the measures thus taken were presented as the destruction of Kurdish citizens’ houses with a view to depriving them of all means of subsistence.', 'Through its aggressive and provocative language the leaflet in question had been likely to incite citizens of “Kurdish” origin to believe that they suffered from discrimination and that, as victims of a “special war”, they were justified in acting in self-defence against the authorities by setting up “neighbourhood committees”. In addition, the population of İzmir in general, and its shopkeepers in particular might have been tempted to think that those who were truly responsible for their social and economic troubles were their “Kurdish” fellow-citizens and that the street traders – all “Kurdish” according to the leaflet – might endanger their well-being. Such a message was not consistent with the calls to “brotherhood”, which were designed only to enable the leaflet’s authors to evade their criminal responsibility.', 'With reference to the analysis of the situation in Turkey made by the Court in the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997 ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII), the Government observed that in the present case the National Security Court had noted a dangerous tendency in İzmir, which had the potential to create an explosive situation, as in south-eastern Turkey, where there had been an intolerable increase in terrorism in the years 1992 and 1993. In such a case the wide limits of criticism acceptable in political debate and the high level of protection enshrined by the Court’s case-law on the question were completely without relevance.', 'In that context, Mr Incal, who was a lawyer by profession, had overstepped the normal limits of political controversy by disregarding his “duties” and “responsibilities”. He had tried to incite an ethnic group to rise against the officials and authorities of the State at a time when the PKK, a terrorist separatist organisation, had intensified its atrocities prompted by racial hatred. In such a social climate, which made it extremely easy to stir up internal dissent, or even civil strife, the Turkish authorities had had no other choice than to seize the leaflets in issue and to punish the applicant as one of those responsible.', '(iii) The Commission', '45. The Commission agreed for the most part with the applicant’s arguments. It emphasised that the leaflet in issue only drew attention in general terms to the existence of a “Kurdish problem” and did not contain any element of incitement to violence. Considering that an opponent of official ideas and positions must be able to find a place in the political arena, it expressed the opinion that Mr Incal’s conviction had not been necessary in a democratic society.', '(b) The Court’s assessment', ""46. As the Court has often observed, the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual's self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among many other authorities, the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 22, § 42, and the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 25, § 52)."", 'While precious to all, freedom of expression is particularly important for political parties and their active members (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 22, § 46). They represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of a politician who is a member of an opposition party, like the applicant, call for the closest scrutiny on the Court’s part (see the Castells judgment cited above, ibid.)', '47. In the present case the İzmir National Security Court based its decision to convict Mr Incal on a leaflet which it held to make out the offence defined in Article 312 of the Criminal Code, namely non-public incitement to commit an offence (see paragraph 21 above).', '48. In the light of the above considerations, the Court must now consider the leaflet’s content in order to determine whether it justified Mr Incal’s conviction.', 'In that connection, the Court reiterates that its task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, it must satisfy itself that the national authorities based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 26, § 52).', '49. The National Security Court held that, by describing the State as terrorist, by drawing a distinction between citizens even though all of them were of Turkish nationality and by criticising certain municipal measures as operations in a special war, the authors of the leaflet had knowingly incited the people to hatred and hostility and, to that end, had urged them to have recourse to illegal methods.', '50. The Court notes that the relevant passages in the leaflet criticised certain administrative and municipal measures taken by the authorities, in particular against street traders. They thus reported actual events which were of some interest to the people of İzmir.', 'The leaflet began by complaining of an atmosphere of hostility towards citizens of Kurdish origin in İzmir and suggested that the measures concerned were directed against them in particular, to force them to leave the city. The text contained a number of virulent remarks about the policy of the Turkish government and made serious accusations, holding them responsible for the situation. Appealing to “all democratic patriots”, it described the authorities’ actions as “terror” and as part of a “special war” being conducted “in the country” against “the Kurdish people”. It called on citizens to “oppose” this situation, in particular by means of “neighbourhood committees” (see paragraph 10 above).', 'The Court certainly sees in these phrases appeals to, among others, the population of Kurdish origin, urging them to band together to raise certain political demands. Although the reference to “neighbourhood committees” appears unclear, those appeals cannot, however, if read in context, be taken as incitement to the use of violence, hostility or hatred between citizens.', '51. Admittedly, as the Court has already noted in other circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 58), it cannot be ruled out that such a text may conceal objectives and intentions different from the ones it proclaims. However, as there is no evidence of any concrete action which might belie the sincerity of the aim declared by the leaflet’s authors, the Court sees no reason to doubt it.', '52. There remains, therefore, the question whether, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the applicant’s criminal conviction can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society, that is to say whether it met a “pressing social need” and was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued”.', '53. The freedom of political debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature. A Contracting State may make it subject to certain “restrictions” or “penalties”, but it is for the Court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in the Convention (see the Castells judgment cited above, p. 23, § 46).', 'In the present case the Government pleaded the “duties” and “responsibilities” with which Article 10 links exercise of the freedom of expression (see paragraph 44 above). However, these do not dispense with the obligation to ensure that an interference satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 (see, mutatis mutandis, the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 64).', '54. The limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen, or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Furthermore, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless it remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Castells judgment cited above, p. 23, § 46).', '55. In the present case the İzmir executive committee of the HEP submitted one copy of the leaflet to the İzmir prefecture on 2 July 1992 with an application for permission to distribute it (see paragraph 11 above). The security police, who were then asked to study its content, considered that the leaflet could be regarded as separatist propaganda (see paragraph 12 above). At that stage the authorities were accordingly in a position to require changes to the text. However, the day after this application was lodged at the prefecture the leaflets were seized and prosecutions brought against its authors, including Mr Incal, under Article 312 of the Criminal Code, among other provisions (see paragraph 21 above).', '56. The Court notes the radical nature of the interference in question. Its preventive aspect by itself raises problems under Article 10 (see, among other authorities, the Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the Netherlands judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 306-A, p. 16, §§ 45 and 46, and, mutatis mutandis, the Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi v. Austria judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, pp. 18–19, § 40).', 'In addition, the İzmir National Security Court sentenced the applicant to six months and twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of 55,555 Turkish liras and disqualified him from driving for fifteen days (see paragraph 16 above).', 'Furthermore, as a result of his conviction of a “public order” offence, Mr Incal was debarred from the civil service and forbidden to take part in a number of activities within political organisations, associations or trade unions (see paragraph 22 above).', '57. In order to demonstrate the existence of a “pressing social need” which would justify the finding that the interference complained of was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued”, the representative of the Government asserted at the hearing before the Court that “it was apparent from the wording of the leaflets … that they were intended to foment an insurrection by one ethnic group against the State authorities”. It had therefore been the State’s “duty to forestall any attempt to promote terrorist activities by means of incitement to hatred”, given that “the interest in combating and crushing terrorism takes precedence in a democratic society”. Certain armed groups such as the PKK increased their effectiveness by putting out propaganda cloaked by the freedom of expression.', '58. The Court is prepared to take into account the background to the cases submitted to it, particularly problems linked to the prevention of terrorism (see, among other authorities, the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 9 et seq., §§ 11 et seq.; the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2281 and 2284, §§ 70 and 84; the Zana judgment cited above, p. 2549, §§ 59 and 60; and, most recently, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 27, § 59). It observes, however, that the circumstances of the present case are not comparable to those found in the Zana case (ibid.). Here the Court does not discern anything which would warrant the conclusion that Mr Incal was in any way responsible for the problems of terrorism in Turkey, and more specifically in İzmir. It should be pointed out in that connection that not even the National Security Court upheld the public prosecutor’s submission that the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) should be applied to the applicant (see paragraphs 15, 16 and 24 above).', '59. In conclusion, Mr Incal’s conviction was disproportionate to the aim pursued, and therefore unnecessary in a democratic society.', 'There has accordingly been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention.', '60. The applicant further complained of an infringement of his right to freedom of thought, guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention. Like the Commission, the Court considers that this complaint is subsumed by the complaint under Article 10 and that it is not necessary to examine it separately.', 'II. Alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention', '61. Mr Incal further argued that neither his trial in the İzmir National Security Court nor the proceedings before the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation had satisfied the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides:', '“In the determination of … any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing … by an independent and impartial tribunal…”', 'He submitted that the National Security Court was not an “independent and impartial tribunal”; as to the Court of Cassation, it had not respected the principle of adversarial procedure or equality of arms and had not held a hearing.', 'The Government rejected this argument, whereas the Commission accepted it, except for that part which related to the lack of a public hearing.', 'A. The proceedings in the National Security Court', '1. Arguments of the participants', '(a) The applicant', '62. Mr Incal submitted that the İzmir National Security Court could not be regarded as an “independent and impartial tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The military judge who sat in it was dependent on the executive and, more specifically, on the military authorities, because while performing his judicial duties he remained an officer and maintained his links with the armed forces and his hierarchical superiors. The latter retained the power to influence his career by means of the assessment reports they drew up on him.', 'Mr Incal maintained that the National Security Courts were special courts set up to protect the State’s interests rather than to do justice as such; in that respect their function was similar to that of the executive. The presence of a military judge in the court’s composition only served to confirm the army’s authority and its intimidating influence over both the defendant and public opinion in general. The fact that a military judge was able to pass judgment on a civilian, and a politician at that, in connection with an offence that had nothing to do with military justice, evidenced the armed forces’ influence over the handling of Turkey’s political problems.', '(b) The Government', '63. The Government submitted that the procedure for the appointment of the military judges sitting as members of the National Security Courts and the safeguards they enjoyed in the performance of their judicial duties perfectly satisfied the criteria laid down by the Court’s case-law on the subject.', 'The arguments concerning these judges’ responsibility towards their commanding officers and the rules governing their professional assessment were overstated; their duties as officers were limited to obeying military regulations and observing military courtesies. They were safe from any pressure from their hierarchical superiors, as such an attempt was punishable under the Military Criminal Code. The assessment system applied only to military judges’ non-judicial duties. In addition, they had access to their assessment reports and could even challenge their content in the Supreme Military Administrative Court.', 'In the present case, neither the colleagues or hierarchical or disciplinary superiors of the military judge in question nor the public authorities who had appointed him had any connection with the parties to Mr Incal’s trial or any interest whatsoever in the judgment to be delivered.', '(c) The Commission', '64. In the Commission’s submission, the legal rules governing the composition and functioning of the National Security Courts raised a number of questions about their independence, particularly as regards the system for the appointment and assessment of the military judges who sat in them. It took the view that the participation of a military judge in criminal proceedings against a civilian showed the exceptional nature of such proceedings and could be interpreted as an intervention by the armed forces in the field of civil justice. The applicant’s concerns about the National Security Court’s lack of impartiality could therefore be regarded as objectively justified.', '2. The Court’s assessment', '65. The Court reiterates that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered “independent” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of safeguards against outside pressures and the question whether it presents an appearance of independence (see, among many other authorities, the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 281, § 73).', 'As to the condition of “impartiality” within the meaning of that provision, there are two tests to be applied: the first consists in trying to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect. It was not contested before the Court that only the second of these tests was relevant in the instant case (see, mutatis mutandis, the Gautrin and Others v. France judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1030–31, § 58).', 'In the instant case, however, the Court will consider both issues – independence and impartiality – together.', '66. Law no. 2845, promulgated on 16 June 1983, pursuant to Article 143 of the Constitution, governs the composition and functioning of the National Security Courts (see paragraph 28 above). Under the provisions of section 5, these courts are composed of three judges, one of whom is a regular officer and member of the Military Legal Service.', 'As the independence and impartiality of the two civilian judges is not disputed, the Court must determine what the position was with regard to the military judge.', '67. The Court notes that the status of military judges sitting as members of National Security Courts provides certain guarantees of independence and impartiality. For example, military judges undergo the same professional training as their civilian counterparts, which gives them the status of career members of the Military Legal Service. When sitting as members of National Security Courts, military judges enjoy constitutional safeguards identical to those of civilian judges; in addition, with certain exceptions, they may not be removed from office or made to retire early without their consent (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above); as regular members of a National Security Court they sit as individuals; according to the Constitution, they must be independent and no public authority may give them instructions concerning their judicial activities or influence them in the performance of their duties (see paragraphs 27 and 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, the Ettl and Others v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117, p. 18, § 38).', '68. On the other hand, other aspects of these judges’ status make it questionable. Firstly, they are servicemen who still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive. Secondly, they remain subject to military discipline and assessment reports are compiled on them by the army for that purpose (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). Decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraph 29 above). Lastly, their term of office as National Security Court judges is only four years and can be renewed.', '69. The Court notes that the National Security Courts were set up pursuant to the Constitution to deal with offences affecting Turkey’s territorial integrity and national unity, its democratic regime and its State security (see paragraphs 26 and 28 above). Their main distinguishing feature is that, although they are non-military courts, one of their judges is always a member of the Military Legal Service.', '70. At the hearing before the Court the Government submitted that the only justification for the presence of military judges in the National Security Courts was their undoubted competence and experience in the battle against organised crime, including that committed by illegal armed groups. For years the armed forces and the military judges – in whom, moreover, the people placed great trust – had acted, partly under martial law, as the guarantors of the democratic and secular Republic of Turkey, while assuming their social, cultural and moral responsibilities. For as long as the terrorist threat persisted, military judges would have to continue to lend their full support to these special courts, whose task was extremely difficult.', 'It is not for the Court – which is aware of the problems caused by terrorism (see, mutatis mutandis, the judgments cited in paragraph 58 above) – to pass judgment on these assertions. Its task is not to determine in abstracto whether it was necessary to set up such courts in a Contracting State or to review the relevant practice, but to ascertain whether the manner in which one of them functioned infringed the applicant’s right to a fair trial (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Fey v. Austria judgment of 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A, p. 12, § 27).', '71. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused (see, among other authorities, the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 48, the Thorgeir Thorgeirson judgment cited above, p. 23, § 51, and the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 794, § 38). In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacks independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt judgment cited above, p. 21, § 48, and the Gautrin and Others judgment cited above, pp. 1030–31, § 58).', '72. Mr Incal was convicted of disseminating separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences, for participating in the decision to distribute the leaflet in issue, taken on 1 July 1992 by the executive committee of the İzmir section of the HEP (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). As the acts which gave rise to the case were considered likely to endanger the founding principles of the Republic of Turkey, or to affect its security, they came ipso jure under the jurisdiction of the National Security Courts (see paragraph 28 above).', 'The Court notes, however, that in considering the question of compliance with Article 10 it did not discern anything in the leaflet which might be regarded as incitement of part of the population to violence, hostility or hatred between citizens (see paragraph 50 above). Moreover, the National Security Court refused to apply the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) (see paragraph 16 above). In addition, the Court attaches great importance to the fact that a civilian had to appear before a court composed, even if only in part, of members of the armed forces.', 'It follows that the applicant could legitimately fear that because one of the judges of the İzmir National Security Court was a military judge it might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. The Court of Cassation was not able to dispel these concerns, as it did not have full jurisdiction (see paragraph 25 above and, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Helle v. Finland judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2926, § 46).', '73. In conclusion, the applicant had legitimate cause to doubt the independence and impartiality of the İzmir National Security Court.', 'There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 § 1.', 'B. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation', '74. Having regard to the above conclusion (see paragraph 73 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to consider the other complaints under Article 6 relating to the proceedings in the Court of Cassation (see, mutatis mutandis, the Findlay judgment cited above, pp. 282–83, § 80).', 'III. Alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention', '75. In his application to the Commission Mr Incal also alleged a breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 in that in refusing his application for his prison sentence to be commuted to a fine the İzmir National Security Court had taken account of his political opinions only. He did not maintain this complaint during the proceedings before the Court, which sees no reason to examine it of its own motion (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 28, § 62).', 'IV. application of Article 50 of the Convention', '76. Under Article 50 of the Convention,', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Elimination of the consequences of the conviction', '77. At the hearing Mr Incal asked to be reinstated in the rights he had lost, pursuant to Article 312 of the Criminal Code, on account of his conviction. He also asked the Court to order the Government to take steps to ensure that this provision would no longer be applied in domestic law.', '78. The Court notes that it has no jurisdiction under the Convention to order such measures (see, mutatis mutandis, the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 1 April 1998 ( Article 50 ), Reports 1998-II, pp. 723 ‑ 24, § 47).', 'B. Damage and costs and expenses', '79. The applicant claimed 2,000,000 French francs (FRF) for pecuniary damage and FRF 5,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage.', 'In support of his claims he asserted that at the material time he was in practice as a lawyer and was an associate director of five commercial undertakings. He asserted that he had sustained a considerable loss of income.', 'Mr Incal further claimed reimbursement of his costs and expenses, which amounted to FRF 20,000 for preparing and communicating the documents produced in Strasbourg and FRF 80,000 for his representation before the Convention institutions, including his lawyers’ fees.', '80. The Government argued, as their principal submission, that no compensation was called for in the present case. In the alternative, they maintained that the sums claimed were excessive and unjustified.', 'They emphasised that the applicant had had the advantage of a stay of execution of four months in which to organise his affairs and minimise any losses. If the Court were to find a violation of the Convention, that finding in itself would constitute sufficient just satisfaction, as no causal connection had been established between the facts complained of and the damage alleged.', 'The Government also considered that the claim in respect of costs and expenses had not been duly documented.', '81. With regard to pecuniary damage, the Delegate of the Commission suggested that the Court should consider the question of the application of Article 50 in the light of the hypothetical character of the amount claimed. He left the question of non-pecuniary damage to the Court’s discretion. Lastly, with regard to the sum claimed for costs and expenses, he mentioned the problem raised by the lack of supporting documents.', '82. On the question of pecuniary damage, the Court considers in the first place that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 § 1 would have been. It further notes that there is insufficient proof of a causal connection between the breach of Article 10 it has found and the loss of professional and commercial income alleged by the applicant. Moreover, the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary damage are not supported by any evidence whatsoever. The Court can therefore not allow them.', 'With regard to non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the applicant suffered a certain amount of distress on account of the facts of the case. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 50, the Court awards him compensation in the sum of FRF 30,000 under this head.', '83. With regard to costs and expenses, the Court awards Mr Incal, on an equitable basis and according to the criteria laid down by its case-law (see, among other authorities, the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, p. 20, § 49), the overall sum of FRF 15,000.', 'D. Default interest', '84. The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment, which is 3.36% per annum.']",2,tr,001-58197,0

The applicant, Mr Salih Tekin, a Turkish citizen of Kurdish origin, was born in 1964 and lives in Diyarbakır. Prior to the events in question, he had been employed as a journalist for the newspaper Özgür Gündem.', 'The facts in the case are disputed.', 'A. The applicant’s detention', '8. It was not disputed that in February 1993, during a visit to his family in the hamlet of Yassıtepe, the applicant was arrested, on suspicion of threatening village guards, by gendarmes under the command of Officer Harun Altın and taken to Derinsu gendarmerie headquarters.', 'The applicant alleged that his arrest took place on the morning of 15 February 1993, whereas the Government claimed that it occurred on 17 February 1993.', '9. He was held at Derinsu until 19 February 1993.', 'He alleged that during his time in custody there he was detained in a cell without any lighting, bed or blankets, in sub-zero temperatures, and fed with only bread and water. He claimed to have been assaulted in his cell by gendarmes, including Officer Altın. He stated that he would have died of cold had his three brothers not been permitted to enter his cell on the night of 18 February and wrapped him in extra clothing.', 'The Government denied that Mr Tekin had been ill-treated. They stated that it would have been impossible for the temperature in the security room to have dropped below freezing-point, since it was situated in the centre of the building and surrounded by other units heated by coal-burning stoves. They also denied that his brothers had been allowed to join him there.', '10. On the morning of 19 February 1993, the applicant was taken to Derik district gendarmerie headquarters. He was released on the same day.', 'He alleged to have been tortured at Derik, through the application of cold water, electric shocks and beatings, with the purpose of forcing him to sign a confession statement. He claimed that the district gendarmerie commander, Musa Çitil, threatened him with death if he returned to the area.', 'The Government contested that any ill-treatment had taken place.', 'B. The applicant’s complaint to public prosecutor Hasan Altun', '11. Prior to being released, Mr Tekin was brought before the public prosecutor, Hasan Altun.', 'It was not disputed that he complained to Mr Altun of having been tortured and ill-treated at both Derinsu and Derik. The applicant claimed in addition that he had handed Mr Altun a wet piece of cloth with which he had been blindfolded while being hosed with water. Mr Altun recorded these allegations, but took no further action in relation to them.', '12. The Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors consequently decided to commence an investigation into the reasons for Mr Altun’s inaction, which led to disciplinary proceedings being launched against him. During the hearing before the Court the Government confirmed that these proceedings had not yet been concluded.', '13. Mr Tekin returned to Diyarbakır on 20 February 1993. He did not see a doctor after his release. The following week he lodged a complaint about his treatment with the Human Rights Association, which advised him to make an application to the Commission.', 'C. Criminal proceedings against the applicant', '14. Since the offence with which the applicant was charged (see paragraph 8 above) fell within the competence of the National Security Courts (see paragraph 29 below), a Derik public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case to the Diyarbakır National Security Court.', 'Following a hearing on 13 May 1993, the applicant was acquitted on 2 August 1993.', 'D. Proceedings against gendarmerie officers Altın and Çitil', '15. Following the Commission’s communication to the Government on 11 October 1993 of Mr Tekin’s application, the Ministry of Justice (International Law and External Relations General Directorate) contacted the public prosecutor’s office in Derik on 18 December 1993, informing it of the applicant’s complaints. A preliminary investigation was opened.', '16. Officer Altın was questioned in connection with Mr Tekin’s allegations by a public prosecutor in Daday district on 20 April 1994, at the request of the Derik public prosecutor, Bekir Özenir.', '17. Mr Özenir issued a decision of non-prosecution in relation to officers Altın and Çitil on 4 May 1994, on the grounds that there was no evidence that they had ill-treated or threatened Mr Tekin, other than the latter’s unsubstantiated allegations.', '18. However, this decision was not made final following the intervention of the Ministry of Justice, which took the view that Mr Tekin should be given the opportunity to file an appeal against it. Furthermore, because of the identities of the defendants and the nature of the allegations against them, the Ministry of Justice considered that the alleged offences might fall within the scope of the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants, over which the public prosecutor had no jurisdiction (see paragraph 30 below).', '19. A decision of non-jurisdiction was subsequently issued by the Derik public prosecutor’s office on 4 May 1995 and the case was referred to the Derik District Administrative Council.', '20. In this connection, on 14 July 1995, a statement was taken from Commander Çitil by a gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel.', '21. The Derik District Administrative Council submitted its summary investigation report to the office of the Mardin provincial governor on 5 September 1995. On 12 September 1995, this report was referred to the Mardin Provincial Administrative Council (see paragraph 30 below). The latter decided, on 13 September 1995, that, due to lack of evidence, officers Altın and Çitil were exempt from public prosecution.', '22. This decision was subject to an automatic appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 30 below). The latter confirmed the decision of non-prosecution.', 'E. The Commission’s findings of fact', '23. The Commission conducted an investigation into the facts, with the assistance of the parties. It accepted written material, including witness statements, reports about Turkey, documents relating to the applicant’s detention at Derinsu and Derik gendarmerie headquarters and to the investigation on the domestic level into the applicant’s allegations, and a floor plan of Derinsu gendarmerie headquarters. In addition, three delegates of the Commission heard the oral evidence of seven witnesses in Diyarbakır on 8 November 1995 and a further hearing took place before the Commission in Strasbourg on 7 March 1996. The witnesses included the applicant, his father, Hacı Mehmet Tekin, officers Harun Altın and Musa Çitil, and three neighbours of the applicant’s father, Sinan Dinç, Mehmet Dinç and Halit Tutmaz, who alleged to have spoken to the applicant shortly after his release.', 'The Commission had requested the attendance of the public prosecutors Hasan Altun, Bekir Özenir and Osman Yetkin (the latter was the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır National Security Court), but none of them appeared to give evidence.', '24. The Commission was unable to determine the date of the applicant’s arrest or the precise details of his treatment in custody. However, cautiously evaluating the evidence, the Commission was satisfied that the applicant had been kept in a cold and dark cell and blindfolded and treated in a way which left wounds and bruises on his body in connection with his interrogation.']","['ii. relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. State of emergency', '25. Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the south-east of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has, according to the Government, claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and members of the security forces.', '26. Two principal decrees relating to the south-eastern region have been made under the Law on the State of Emergency (Law no. 2935, 25 October 1983). The first, Decree no. 285 (10 July 1987), established a regional governorship of the state of emergency in ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey. Under Article 4 (b) and (d) of the decree, all private and public security forces and the Gendarmerie Public Peace Command are at the disposal of the regional governor.', 'The second, Decree no. 430 (16 December 1990), reinforced the powers of the regional governor, for example to order transfers out of the region of public officials and employees, including judges and prosecutors, and provided in Article 8:', '“No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this Decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.”', 'B. General provisions against ill-treatment, threats and unlawful detention', '27. The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence:', '(a) to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179 generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants),', '(b) to issue threats (Article 191),', '(c) to subject an individual to torture or ill-treatment (Articles 243 and 245).', '28. For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.', 'C. Prosecution for terrorist offences and offences allegedly committed by members of the security forces', '29. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of national security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey.', '30. The public prosecutor is also deprived of jurisdiction with regard to offences alleged against members of the security forces in the state of emergency region. Decree no. 285, Article 4 § 1, provides that all security forces under the command of the regional governor (see paragraph 26 above) shall be subject, in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties, to the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants. Thus, any public prosecutor who receives a complaint alleging a criminal act by a member of the security forces must make a decision of non-jurisdiction and transfer the file to the Administrative Council. A decision by the Council not to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '31. Mr Tekin applied to the Commission on 14 July 1993. He alleged that he had been ill-treated while being held in detention at gendarmerie headquarters in Derinsu and Derik from 15–19 February 1993 and that this event had not been adequately investigated by the State authorities. He relied on Articles 2, 3, 5 § 1, 6 § 1, 10, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention.', '32. The Commission declared the application (no. 22496/93) admissible on 20 February 1995. In its report of 17 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Articles 2, 10, 14 and 18 (unanimously), but that there had been violations of Articles 3 and 13 (thirty-one votes to one) and that it was not necessary to examine the applicant’s other complaints (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '33. In their written and oral submissions, the Government asked the Court to find that the applicant’s allegations had been unsubstantiated and that there had been no violation of the Convention.', '34. The applicant asked the Court to find violations of Articles 2, 3, 10, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. establishment of the facts', '35. The Government challenged the Commission’s findings of fact.', 'They pointed out that had the applicant’s allegations of severe ill-treatment been true, he would have required hospital treatment following his release. In these circumstances it was suspicious that he had not produced any medical reports, particularly since his work as a journalist would have made him aware of the need for this type of evidence. His claim that his brothers had been allowed to join him in his cell was unbelievable. In addition, the facts that he had denied all the charges against him, despite allegedly having been tortured with the purpose of extracting a confession, and that he had not made any allegation concerning electric shocks in his original application to the Commission but only during the hearing of witnesses in Ankara, raised further doubts about the truth of his testimony. Furthermore, they reasoned that if it was true that he had been subjected to electric shocks on the last day of his detention, this would have been easy to establish since this kind of torture leaves marks which remain noticeable for three or four days. Finally, the Government submitted that cloth of the type which the applicant had handed to the public prosecutor could not have been used as a blindfold because of its loose style of weaving.', '36. At the hearing before the Court, the Commission’s Delegate stated that the applicant’s account of events at the hearing in Ankara had been precise, detailed and consistent and had not given the impression of being an invented story. It was true that he had made somewhat varying and probably exaggerated assessments of the temperature in his cell in Derinsu and it could not be excluded that he had also exaggerated the nature and intensity of the ill-treatment to which he claimed to have been subjected. Nonetheless some of the details of his account had the ring of truth: for instance, it was unlikely that he would have invented the incident when his brothers joined him in his cell. What undoubtedly weakened the applicant’s case was the lack of any medical evidence. The Commission had considered whether this omission was such as to undermine the reliability of his allegations in general, but considered that it could not be conclusive.', 'The Commission’s delegates in Ankara had also found the applicant’s father, Hacı Mehmet, to be a credible witness who had confirmed important elements in the applicant’s story. For example, he had described how he and his other sons had waited in the cold outside the gendarmerie headquarters at Derinsu and how at some stage his sons had been allowed to visit their brother in his cell and had used this occasion to warm Salih Tekin’s cold body. He also confirmed that after the applicant’s release there had been bruises and wounds on his body which they had treated with medication.', 'Against these statements had to be weighed the testimony of other witnesses.', 'The Commission had requested the attendance of three public prosecutors, including Mr Altun (see paragraph 11 above), whose testimony would have greatly assisted the Commission in assessing the issues under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. Unfortunately, none of these public prosecutors appeared to give evidence at the hearings and no valid excuse had been given for their non-attendance.', 'Of the witnesses for the Government who did attend the hearings, the Commission’s delegates had found the evidence of the three neighbours (see paragraph 23 above), who described the applicant’s return to the village after his detention, to be unconvincing, particularly their statements concerning the applicant’s praise for the quality of his treatment in police custody, which the Commission considered to be implausible in view of the fact that there was a record of Mr Tekin’s complaint of ill-treatment made to the public prosecutor only hours previously.', 'Gendarmerie officer Altın (see paragraphs 8–9 above) had given a detailed account of the applicant’s treatment at Derinsu, denying all allegations of ill-treatment and stating that Mr Tekin had been kept in good conditions, in a room which had not been cold, and had been provided with water and three meals a day. The Commission, however, had serious doubts about officer Altın’s credibility in view of the fact that, two years earlier, he had told the public prosecutor that he had no recollection whatsoever of the applicant, despite the fact that there had apparently only been a small number of detainees at Derinsu gendarmerie headquarters during 1993.', 'When making a final evaluation of the evidence, the Commission had been convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tekin had been detained in extreme conditions and had undergone physical ill-treatment.', '37. The applicant asked the Court to accept the Commission’s findings of fact.', '38. The Court reiterates that under its case-law the establishment and verification of the facts are primarily a matter for the Commission (Articles 28 § 1 and 31 of the Convention). While the Court is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, it is only in exceptional circumstances that it will exercise its powers in this area. Such exceptional circumstances may arise in particular if the Court, following a careful examination of the evidence on which the Commission has based its conclusions, finds that the facts have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt (see the Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, pp. 904–05, § 53).', '39. The Court has examined the findings in the Commission’s report and the evidence on which the latter based its conclusions, principally the transcripts of the hearings before it, with a view to determining whether any such exceptional circumstances arise in the present case.', '40. In this connection, it considers it to be of particular significance that the Commission and its delegates had the opportunity to see and hear the applicant and other witnesses give their testimony and answer questions put by the members of the Commission themselves and by lawyers for the Government and the applicant. It notes that the Commission found the applicant’s testimony to be consistent and convincing, whereas it found the evidence given by the witnesses for the Government to be flawed and unreliable (see paragraph 36 above).', '41. It is true that, as the Government have pointed out, the applicant was unable to provide any independent evidence, for example medical reports, to substantiate his allegations of ill-treatment. However, in this respect the Court notes that the State authorities took no steps to ensure that Mr Tekin was seen by a doctor during his time in detention or upon his release, despite the fact that he had complained of ill-treatment to the public prosecutor, Mr Altun, who was under a duty under Turkish law to investigate this complaint (see paragraphs 11 and 28 above). Furthermore, it observes that those witnesses who were best placed to shed light on the veracity or otherwise of the applicant’s story, namely the public prosecutors involved in his case, and particularly Mr Altun, who saw him immediately after his release from custody, failed without good cause to comply with the Commission’s requests to attend its hearings.', 'The Court recalls that Article 28 § 1 (a) of the Convention places the State concerned under a duty to “furnish all necessary facilities” to the Commission for its investigation of the facts underlying a petition. It does not consider that, in the circumstances of the present case, when key witnesses failed to attend before the Commission, the respondent State can be justified in complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence on which the Commission based its findings.', '42. In the light of the above considerations, and having itself examined the documents available in the case, the Court decides to accept the facts as found by the Commission.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION', '43. The applicant alleged that his treatment in police custody had amounted to a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, which provides, inter alia :', '“1. Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law…”', '44. He alleged that he had been threatened repeatedly with death by officer Altın and other gendarmes on the way to Derinsu gendarmerie headquarters, where he had been held in sub-zero conditions with the intention on the part of the gendarmes that he would freeze to death. Moreover at Derik gendarmerie headquarters, Commander Çitil, after having tortured the applicant, threatened to “put two holes in his head” if he came back to the area.', '45. The Government denied that the ill-treatment alleged by the applicant had taken place (see paragraph 35 above).', '46. The Commission found no indication that the applicant’s right to life had not been protected by law.', '47. The Court notes that the facts as found by the Commission, which it has decided to accept, do not support the conclusion that the applicant was treated in such a way as to amount to an interference with his right to life within the meaning of Article 2.', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 2.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION', '48. The applicant claimed to have been tortured in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:', '“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”', '49. He submitted that his experiences of suffering whilst in detention, taken as a whole, amounted to torture. Thus, at Derinsu gendarmerie headquarters he claimed to have been blindfolded while being aggressively interrogated, assaulted and threatened with death, detained for four days in total darkness in sub-zero temperatures with no bed or blankets, and denied food and liquids; all this despite the fact that the gendarmes were aware that he only had one kidney. At Derik gendarmerie headquarters he had again been blindfolded, and also stripped naked, hosed with cold water, beaten with a truncheon on his body and the soles of his feet, and had electric shocks administered to his fingers and toes.', '50. In connection with this complaint also, the Government denied that Mr Tekin had been ill-treated.', '51. The Commission, taking the treatment suffered by the applicant as a whole, found that the conditions of detention and the treatment to which he had been subjected constituted at least inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3.', '52. The Court recalls that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see the above-mentioned Selçuk and Asker judgment, pp. 909–10, § 76).', '53. The Court notes that the Commission found that the applicant was held in a cold and dark cell, blindfolded, and treated, in connection with his interrogation, in a way which left wounds and bruises on his body (see paragraph 24 above).', 'The Court has assessed these facts against the standards imposed by Article 3. It recalls that, in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see the Ribitsch v. Austria judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, p. 26, § 38). It considers that the conditions in which the applicant was held, and the manner in which he must have been treated in order to leave wounds and bruises on his body, amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of that provision.', '54. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 3.', 'IV. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 5 § 1 AND 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION', '55. Before the Court, the applicant did not pursue his claims in respect of Articles 5 § 1 and 6 § 1 of the Convention.', '56. In such circumstances, it is not necessary for the Court to consider these complaints.', 'V. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION', '57. The applicant alleged that his ill-treatment was linked to his employment as a journalist and that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers…', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '58. He contended that the threats he experienced as well as the severity of his treatment, especially at Derinsu, were motivated in part by his employment as a journalist for the newspaper Özgür Gündem, which, because of its Kurdish separatist stance, was considered hostile by those who abused him. He stated that on his arrest and at Derinsu gendarme station he was questioned by officer Altın about his work as a journalist and was threatened with death because of it. At Derik gendarmerie headquarters, Commander Çitil had said to him:', '“You want to come here and mix things up. Özgür Gündem is a banned newspaper. You are writing news about the region. Furthermore, you are threatening village guards. I am going to send you to the public prosecutor but if you come back to this region again we will put two holes in your head.”', '59. The Government made no particular submissions in connection with this complaint.', '60. The Commission did not find sufficient evidence to corroborate the applicant’s complaint that his arrest and detention were due to the fact that he was a journalist with Özgür Gündem.', '61. The Court notes the above finding by the Commission. It does not find it established that the applicant’s detention and treatment in custody amounted to interferences with his right to freedom of expression.', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 10.', 'VI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION', '62. The applicant claimed to have been denied an effective domestic remedy in respect of his Convention complaints, in violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:', '“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”', '63. Mr Tekin asked the Court not only to find that he in particular had been denied an effective remedy for his complaints of ill-treatment, but also to hold generally that the modifications to the law introduced by the state of emergency legislation (see paragraphs 25–30 above), by offering officials in the region de jure or de facto immunity, operated to deny any effective remedy to victims of abuse of power, thus rendering it impossible for the State to satisfy its obligations under Articles 1 and 13 of the Convention.', '64. The Government submitted that domestic remedies in respect of allegations of ill-treatment in custody were effective and available to every citizen. This was borne out by the fact that the public prosecutor’s inactivity had led to an investigation being held into his conduct of Mr Tekin’s case.', '65. The Commission observed that it was undisputed that the applicant had complained to Mr Altun, the Derik public prosecutor, of having been tortured during custody at Derinsu and Derik gendarmerie headquarters, but that Mr Altun took no action in this respect. It considered that the investigation subsequently commenced into the applicant’s allegations was inadequate, and, in any case, could not have made up for the initial inactivity. In the absence of the evidence of the public prosecutors involved in the case (see paragraph 23 above), and on the basis of the available material, the Commission formed the view that the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of torture was so inadequate as to amount to a denial of an effective remedy.', '66. The Court recalls that the nature of the right safeguarded under Article 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13. Where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment by agents of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy” entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2287, § 98).', '67. The Court notes that, on his release from custody, Mr Tekin complained of ill-treatment to Mr Altun, the public prosecutor. The latter, however, failed to take any action in respect of this complaint. It was not until some ten months later, following the Commission’s communication of the application to the Government, that an investigation was commenced into the applicant’s allegations. Moreover, even once the investigation had been opened, a further four months elapsed before a statement was taken from officer Altın, and it would appear that no attempt was made to question Commander Çitil before the decision was taken on 4 May 1994 that there was insufficient evidence to merit a prosecution against either of the officers accused by Mr Tekin of ill-treating him (see paragraphs 16–18 above). Subsequently, a full year later, a decision of non-jurisdiction was issued and the investigation was transferred to the Derik District Administrative Council, at the request of which, on 14 July 1995, a statement was finally taken from Commander Çitil (see paragraphs 20–21 above).', '68. The Court does not consider that the above investigation can properly be described as thorough and effective such as to meet the requirements of Article 13.', 'It notes the applicant’s request that it examine the operation of remedies generally within the state of emergency area, but it does not consider that the evidence established by the Commission enables it to reach any conclusion in this connection.', '69. In conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 13.', 'VII. ALLEGED VIOLATIONs OF ARTICLES 14 AND 18 OF THE CONVENTION', '70. The applicant submitted that because of his Kurdish origin the various alleged violations of his Convention rights were discriminatory, in breach of Article 14, which provides:', '“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”', 'He also claimed that his experiences represented an authorised practice by the State in breach of Article 18 of the Convention, which provides:', '“The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.”', '71.

The association’s headquarters were to be at Florina. According to clause 2 of its memorandum of association, the association’s objects were “(a) the cultural, intellectual and artistic development of its members and of the inhabitants of Florina in general and the fostering of a spirit of cooperation, solidarity and love between them; (b) cultural decentralisation and the preservation of intellectual and artistic endeavours and traditions and of the civilisation’s monuments and, more generally, the promotion and development of [their] folk culture; and (c) the protection of the region’s natural and cultural environment”.', 'A.

On 9 August 1990 the court, having heard the applicants, refused their application on the following grounds:', '“It is apparent from the documents lodged by the applicants and from the information which the Court may take into consideration of its own motion … that recognition of the association under this same name has already been sought, in an application on 19 January 1990 which was dismissed by this Court on 19 March 1990... Now that the words [the defence of national independence] that constituted the ground on which the aforementioned application was dismissed as being contrary to law have been deleted, a fresh application has been made for recognition of the association in question. Some of the founder members of the association who are on the provisional management committee … have engaged in promoting the idea that there is a Macedonian minority in Greece (see, for example, the newspapers Makhitis, Ellinikos Voras, Nea and Stokhos of 28 June 1990, 24 June 1990, 18 June 1990 and 28 June 1990 respectively); these newspapers strengthen the Court all the more in its previous opinion as none of the applicants has so far cast any doubt on the matters set out in these newspapers …, namely that they travelled to Copenhagen on 9 June 1990 and took part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), where they maintained that there was a Macedonian minority in Greece and even congratulated Professor Ataov, a Turk, who read out a text containing provocative and unacceptable allegations against Greece. One of the members of the provisional management committee, Mr Constantinos Gotsis, refused, in the course of proceedings in the Florina Court of First Instance against the publisher of the newspaper Stokhos, to accept that he was Greek… Besides, sixteen founder members of the above-mentioned association reportedly contributed money so that Christos Sidiropoulos and Stavros Anastassiadis could go to Copenhagen to defend their ideas… On the basis of the foregoing circumstances, which have been proved, the Court considers that the true object of the aforementioned association is not the one indicated in clause 2 of the memorandum of association but the promotion of the idea that there is a Macedonian minority in Greece, which is contrary to the country’s national interest and consequently contrary to law.', '…”', 'B.

This accounts for the announcement that the Yugoslav consul in Salonika, Sasko Todorovski, is to be expelled just 72 hours before tomorrow’s hearing. Todorovski’s cover was blown when Ellinikos Voras revealed on 17 February that he was the leader of a triangle opposed to Greek Macedonia and including the American vice-consul, Colonel Donald Miller, and the educational adviser of the American embassy in Athens, John Kiesling.', 'It is also known that Donald Miller left Salonika ‘overnight’ for the United States when Ellinikos Voras exposed his dark ‘triangular’ role in the State Department’s contemptible report. Todorovski is a tool of the Yugoslav secret service and used agents to lead an international destabilisation operation in Greek Macedonia.', 'One stage of this destabilisation operation unfolds tomorrow in Salonika. The city’s Court of Appeal will consider the application by seventeen inhabitants of the prefecture of Florina for approval of their memorandum of association for establishing an association called ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’. The memorandum of association is drafted with expert care so as to provide full international legal cover for a well-planned destabilisation of the country – the legal wrapping of a Trojan horse on Greece’s borders. The application in question was refused by the lower court at Florina, where an earlier, less veiled version drawn up by the same persons had also been refused. The new application in the Salonika Court of Appeal tomorrow will be heard as ‘a straightforward everyday case’.', 'However, evidence and information from Slavic sources reveals the following.', '(a) The leaders of the seventeen, most of whom were ensnared by what seemed an innocent ‘cultural’ project, are Christos Sidiropoulos from Amindaio, a forester with the Ministry of Agriculture, and Stavros Anastassiadis, a wealthy businessman from Meliti in the prefecture of Florina, both of whom are signatories of the application. The two also appeared last June at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Copenhagen on the subject of human rights, declaring that they were Greek citizens but Macedonian nationals, and denounced the Greek State for ‘oppressing’ the ‘Macedonians’ of ‘Aegean Macedonia’ and ‘depriving’ them of all human rights. In fact, according to the newspaper run by the émigré independence movement in Australia, Australian Macedonian (1/8/1990), the two men carried letters containing similar allegations from Petros Dimtsis of Kato Klines, a village in the prefecture of Florina, who lodged a complaint in Strasbourg in May 1989, and from Stefos Skenderis, a teacher in the Greek State education service who lives at Florina.', '(b) As disclosed by the ‘Australian-Macedonian Committee for Human Rights’ on 1 August 1990, Christos Sidiropoulos is the invisible leader of a secret phantom organisation of ‘Aegean Macedonians’, the ‘Central organising committee for the Macedonian human rights of the Macedonians of Aegean Macedonia’. In 1984 this organisation distributed by post a manifesto containing the ‘demands of the Macedonians of Aegean Macedonia’ which caused the Greek people profound unease and distress at the activities of invisible agents belonging to an independence movement within Greek Macedonia. This secret phantom movement remains unknown; however, it claims to be based in Salonika and it is certain that it is directed from abroad and imports all its printed propaganda against Greek Macedonia from foreign countries.', '(c) The application to be heard tomorrow in the Salonika Court of Appeal for registration of the ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’ will in fact set in motion a provocation of the Greek system of justice which was planned abroad as far back as 1989. The aim is to trap Greece into a series of legal refusals which will then be used against Greece by Skopje in the European Court of Human Rights and the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. The plot is satanic because if the Greek courts accept the application by the leader of the ‘Aegean Macedonians’, Greece will be legalising a Trojan horse sent by Skopje to trap unwitting bilingual Greek Macedonians and deliver them into the claws of foreigners and of propaganda inspired from abroad.', 'The Slavic plot which is to be submitted tomorrow in Salonika to unsuspecting appeal court judges is part of a directive released by independence activists in Australia two years ago, in 1989, following their first appearance on the international stage at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. At the time ‘Macedonian’ professors Michael Radin and Chris Popov, who are Australian citizens, released a plan of action entitled ‘The road to Macedonian human rights’ on behalf of the Salonika ‘section’. The report was written in English and printed abroad and its title mentions that it is a publication of Christos Sidiropoulos’s secret phantom organisation in Salonika. It contains 55 pages; page 38 contains the following revelations:', '‘The following scenario is a convincing way of lawfully challenging the denial of Macedonians’ rights by the Greek State. Macedonians from Aegean Macedonia could, for instance, set up an association for popular dances with the name “Macedonian Folklore Association”. The association will undoubtedly be forbidden by the laws mentioned above, which prohibit establishing groups on the ground of nationality. Provided that all appeals to the lower courts are turned down, the case will go through the Greek judicial system until it reaches the country’s highest court, the Court of Cassation. The refusal of an appeal at that level will mean that all domestic legal remedies have been exhausted. One of the conditions for submission of a case to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights will thus have been fulfilled. Within six months of the Supreme Court’s decision an application can be submitted on the ground that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association has been violated, with the result that the Court of Human Rights, or the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, will deliver a decision against Greece.’', 'This foreign directive will be carried out to the letter tomorrow when the Salonika Court of Appeal considers the application to establish the ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’.', 'Christos Sidiropoulos and Stavros Anastassiadis are acting under the control of independence activists Radin and Popov who drew up the above report or directive. With them as leaders, along with two others from Skopje and about ten other representatives of ‘Macedonian’ independence movements from the United States, Canada and Europe, Sidiropoulos and Anastassiadis appeared in Copenhagen at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to accuse Greece at a press conference organised by Yugoslavia’s official diplomatic delegation to the CSCE. At the conference Sidiropoulos was seated beside the secretary of the Yugoslav embassy, who directed the discussion with the foreign journalists.', 'On 15 July 1990 Macedonia, a newspaper in the service of Slav independence activists fighting in the United States and Canada for the separation of Greek Macedonia and its incorporation into Skopje, published a revealing photograph in which Sidiropoulos and Anastassiadis appear beside their instructors Radin and Popov and their leaders from Skopje in the midst of the group of agents presented by the Yugoslavian diplomatic mission at the CSCE. In this newspaper, which is run by Slav independence activists, the photograph and report appear under the headline ‘Yugoslavia protecting minority rights’.”']","['III. In view of the strong public interest at stake, the court, when examining the grounds of an application being heard under the special procedure, as in the present case, may and indeed must take into consideration, of its own motion, matters over and above the evidence submitted to the court by the parties – in particular, real events and situations reported in publications (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.) accessible to any interested person – and this notwithstanding the ordinary rules on the burden of proof. On the basis of the well-known facts set out below, whose validity the Court does not doubt, the Court accepts the following in relation to the case. Ancient (classical) Macedonia is delimited to the south by the Aegean Sea and the Kamvounia, Pieria and Olympus mountains; to the north by Lake Ohrid, the Prespa lakes, and the Babuna-Skomion ( Rila Planina ) and Rhodope mountains; to the east by the river Nestos; and to the west by Mount Grammos and the Pindus range (see: Makedonia, Ekdotiki Athinon, pp. 10 et seq.; A. Vakalopoulos, Synchrona Valkanika Ethnologika Provlimata, p. II; G. Mintsis, Istoria tou Makedonikou Zetematos, p. 29). Its inhabitants (the Macedonians) were one of the most ancient Greek tribes, closely related to the Thessalians, who were also of Aeolian origin, and especially to the Magnesians. Their language was one of the oldest Greek dialects, akin to Aeolian and Arcado -Cyprian and also to the Mycenean dialect. Their religion was that common to the Greeks and their myths and traditions were similar to those elsewhere in the Greek world (see H.G. Wells, The Outline of History, trans. K. Yeroyannis as Pankosmios Istoria, Pergaminai, Chapter B 1, p. 439, and Chapter I, p. 367; Will Durant, Pankosmios Istoria tou Politismou, ed. A. Daskalakis, 1965, p. 483V; Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Maties stin Pankosmia Istoria, trans. P. Drakou, Faros, 1954, p. 25; A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 14 et seq.; M. Sakellariou, I taftotita ton Makedonon, communication to the Academy of Athens on 8 November 1988; K. Vavouskos, correction of the draft article on Macedonia for the new Australian encyclopedia Australian People, speech to the special meeting of the Academy of Athens on 7 March 1989; N. Andriotis, The Language and the Greek Origin of the Ancient Macedonians, Salonika, 1978). The Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander the Great acted not just as Greeks but as pan-Hellenists, in the sense that they incarnated the old idea of the creation of a unified Greek State by bringing together the smaller Greek territories; they were bearers, and the latter was a disseminator, not of an incomplete Macedonian civilisation but of Greek civilisation (see Johann Gustav Droysen, Istoria tou Megalou Alexandrou, trans. with commentary etc. by Renos Apostolidis, 1988, pp. 1–9 and 28 et seq.; Istoria tou Ellinikou Ethnous, Ekdotiki Athinon, vol. D, pp. 10 et seq.). And in later years, especially after the appearance in the Balkans of the Bulgars and Slavs (6th–7th cent. A.D.), the Macedonian region as defined above was a stronghold and bastion of Hellenism just as it had been in ancient times. Polybius describes Macedonia as a ‘shield’ and praises the Macedonians because they fought the barbarians (non-Greeks) to ensure the safety of the (other) Greeks (Polybius, Historiae, Leipzig edition, 1898, vol. 3, book 9, p. 35). For the Byzantine period the same is affirmed by the French historian Paul Lemerle in his classic work Philippe et la Macédoine orientale, Paris, 1945, pp. 516–17. In addition, a guide to Salonika written by German historians and archaeologists during the last world war states that ‘the waves of migrating peoples which frequently swamped the Balkan peninsula broke on this most powerful bastion of Hellenism’ (see A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 17 et seq.). Nowhere in either the recent or the distant past are Macedonia and the Macedonians mentioned in any official document as a specific ethnic group. The Treaty of Berlin, and the Treaty of San Stefano which it replaced, make no reference to such a notion. In the official Turkish census of 1905 there is mention of Greeks and Bulgarians, or inhabitants whose identity was partly Bulgarian, in the vilayets of Salonika and Monastir, where there were Greek ethnic majorities; but no mention of Macedonians, since nobody declared such descent (A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 84 et seq.; G. Roussos, Neoteri Istoria tou Ellinikou Ethnous, vol. 5, pp. 83 et seq., which includes a reproduction of the census tables). In his work Voyage dans la Macédoine (Paris, 1831) E.M. Cousinery, the French Consul in Salonika, says that the Bulgarians (as all speakers of Slavic were then called) never penetrated the forests beyond Vermion, where the population remained Greek (see vol. 1, pp. 67–68, and vol. 2, p. 140). With reference to the same area, the German geographer Leonard D. Schultze observes that in their language, traditions, cultural affinities, ethnic preferences and religion, its inhabitants are as legitimately and authentically Greek as their brothers further to the south ( Macedonien Landschafts - und Kulturbilder, Jena, 1927, p. 106). He reiterates the words of Lord Salisbury, Great Britain’s representative at the Congress of Berlin, on 19 June 1878, when he said that ‘Macedonia and Thrace are just as Greek as Crete’ (K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 84). The fact that a small part of this region’s population also speaks a language which is basically a form of Bulgarian with admixtures of Slavic, Greek, Vlach and Albanian words, does not prove that this minority is of Slavic or Bulgarian origin; in isolation this criterion is of no value whatsoever, as is borne out by the experience in the recent past of the forced migration from Asia Minor to Greece of populations which were indisputably Greek but totally ignorant of the Greek language. It is indicative that among the fighters of the Macedonian campaign (1904–08) there were men who spoke the Bulgarian-Slav dialect but who had a purely Greek national consciousness; for example Kotas, Dalipis, Kyrou, Gonos and others. In his Short History of the Bulgarian, Serb and Romanian Orthodox Churches (Moscow 1871), the Russian historian E. Golubinstii wrote of these non-Greek-speaking Greeks that they had an implacable hatred of and scorn for all Slavs and Bulgarians (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., pp. 85 et seq.). After the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, 51.57% of the region corresponding to ancient Macedonia was under Greek domination, 38.32% under Yugoslav domination, and 10.11% under Bulgarian domination (see Makedonia, Ekdotiki Athinon, p. 504, which includes a map). In this way a territorial status came into being. There were exchanges of population, either voluntary or following bilateral agreements such as the Kafantari-Molov agreement between Greece and Bulgaria in 1926; and Greeks from Turkey populated the Greek part of Macedonia, so that only Greeks remained in this part of Macedonia, even if some of them were bilingual. Greek Macedonia thus became a completely homogeneous part of Greek territory (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 92; and A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., p. 31, who refers to the work of the German Stephan Ronart, Griechenland von heute ). This was especially true in the period immediately following the Second World War (1945–49), when almost all the bilingual inhabitants of this region who did not have a Greek national consciousness emigrated to neighbouring countries (see E. Kofos, Nationalism and Communism in Macedonia, Salonika, 1964, pp. 185 et seq.). There they experienced a mutation of their partly Greek or partly Bulgarian nationality into a ‘Macedonian’, i.e. a Slav-Macedonian, nationality (see E. Kofos in Yugoslavia Today, Athens, 1990, p. 50; Kentron Apodimu Ellinismou, Makedonia, Istoria kai Politismos, Ekdotiki Athinon, 1989, pp. 29 et seq.). This situation was preceded by a number of violent incidents, such as the Ilinden revolt, in which the Bulgarians claim to have revolted against the Turks on 2 August 1903 at Krusevo, a town near Monastir whose ethnic composition was overwhelmingly Greek. In fact they turned against the town’s Greek inhabitants, whom they tried to wipe out with the cooperation of the Turks and without causing the rest of the population any significant harm (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 89; Douglas Dakin, The Greek Struggle in Macedonia 1897–1913, Salonika, 1966, pp. 92 et seq.; Douglas Dakin, E.K. Mazarakis-Ainianos, E. Kofou and I. Diamantourou, O Makedonikos Agonas, Athens, 1985, pp. 30 et seq.; G. Mintsis, op. cit., pp. 53 et seq.). Until 1914 ‘Macedonia’ as a Slavic State and ‘the Macedonian nation’ as a specific nation were unheard of. The part of Macedonia which fell under Yugoslav domination, like that which fell to Bulgaria, is a narrow strip of land along the Greek border and represents only a small part of Serbia. Skopje, which today is the capital of the misleadingly named Socialist Republic of Macedonia of the Federal Yugoslav State, is far away from Macedonia. The S.R.M. was founded under the German occupation (see E. Kofos, The Impact of the Macedonian Question on Civil Conflict in Greece 1943–1948, Athens, 1989). Its foundation was part of a deliberate strategy according to which, when the regions of Skopje and Tetovo (which belonged to ancient Dardania, a non-Macedonian country) were ceded, a Serb population could be said to exist in the sparsely populated part of Macedonia that lay beyond the Greek borders and contained Serbs, Greeks, Greek Vlachs, Muslims with a partly Turkish identity, and Bulgarians; a Slav-speaking population with a specific dialect and an unstable national consciousness (see A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 12 et seq.; N. Andriotis, The Confederate State of Skopje and its Language, Athens, 1957, with relevant bibliography). The long-term purpose of founding the S.R.M. was to re-establish a Slav Macedonian State with access to the Aegean. One of the means to this end is to enlist in various ways bilingual Greeks from Greek Macedonia. Setting up an association called ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’ at Florina is part of this effort and applies a directive issued by Slav organisations abroad. The aim is to create a Macedonian Question with international ramifications (see statements by Serb politicians to the Borba newspaper, 8 November 1990 and to Nin magazine, 1 February 1991). The parties applying for recognition of the above association are the enablers in this operation. Among them are Christos Sidiropoulos and Stavros Anastassiadis, who appeared at an international conference to dispute the Greek identity of (Greek) Macedonia, the former in particular by distinguishing between Macedonians and Greeks (see the Makedonikos Voras newspaper of 17 March 1991, which includes photographs of the above persons among sixteen members of the ‘Macedonian’ delegation at the CSCE in Copenhagen; and the Ethnos newspaper of 5 February 1991, p. 10). This, in combination with the name of the proposed association and with the whole content of its memorandum of association, renders at least dubious the association’s aims, which according to the founder members’ seemingly lawful statement in clause 2 of the memorandum of association, consist in the cultural, intellectual and artistic advancement of its members, cultural decentralisation, etc. This assessment is supported by the content of clause 3, paragraph 2, of the same memorandum of association, which states that all youths in the Florina area will be enrolled in the proposed association’s youth section. It is clear from this that there is a danger that the immaturity of young people will be exploited and that youths will be trapped by suitable propaganda in an ethnologically non-existent and historically evacuated Slav-Macedonian minority. Clause 4 of the same memorandum of association lays down the condition that enrolment in the association is subject to written acceptance of the association’s principles. Nowhere in the association’s memorandum of association, however, are these principles defined. Thus the memorandum of association does not provide a clear idea of who will enrol, since a clear definition of the principles governing the proposed association is deliberately omitted. Lastly, the very name of the association may be a source of confusion, because at first sight it creates the impression that it refers to Macedonia’s Greek civilisation, whereas in reality it envisages a specifically Slavic civilisation which does not exist in the region in question. Altogether, this Court has good reasons in the light of the foregoing to believe that the purpose of using the term ‘Macedonian’ is to dispute the Greek identity of Macedonia and its inhabitants by indirect and therefore underhand means, and discerns an intention on the part of the founders to undermine Greece’s territorial integrity. The impugned refusal of the application in question was therefore justified, notwithstanding that it was based on shorter and partly different reasoning; and the arguments to the contrary put forward in the present appeal must fail.', '…”', 'The proceedings in the Court of Cassation', '12. On 20 June 1991 the applicants appealed on points of law to the Court of Cassation, relying, in particular, on Articles 2, 4, 5 and 12 of the Greek Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Convention. They maintained that, contrary to law, the Court of Appeal had (a) not confined itself to reviewing the lawfulness of the establishment of their association – namely whether the requirements of Articles 78 to 80 of the Civil Code had been satisfied – but had reviewed its desirability, relying on the presumed intentions of the founder members, which (assuming them to have any reality) could not, however, be the subject of judicial review at the stage of granting the association legal recognition; (b) taken into consideration information (in particular, irresponsible and unfounded press articles concerning some of the founder members) that had not been produced by the parties; (c) accepted as true certain matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings without ordering evidence to be taken to establish whether they were in fact true; (d) distorted the content of the association’s memorandum of association; and (e) not given sufficient reasons in its judgment.', 'In a pleading filed on 25 February 1994 the applicants essentially reiterated the complaints they had set out in their appeal on points of law and stated that the refusal to authorise the founding of their association was based on assessments and assumptions as to their personalities and ideological and historical convictions which in turn rested not on the association’s memorandum of association but on suspect anonymous publications.', '13. In a judgment of 16 May 1994 the Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment. It considered that the grounds of appeal were vague and unfounded. It pointed out that under the special procedure for granting recognition to associations, the inquisitorial system allowed the court to take into account, of its own motion, matters which had not been mentioned by the parties and that the court was not bound by the parties’ evidence and assertions. As to the “matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings”, the parties had not specified the matters in question in their appeal. The Court of Appeal had accepted the truth of certain circumstances in reliance on the content of the association’s memorandum of association and on matters that were common knowledge and supported by documents such as the press articles; and there had not, moreover, been any distortion of the content of the memorandum of association. The Court of Cassation also held that sufficient reasons had been given in the Court of Appeal’s judgment. It further noted that the assertion that Articles 2, 4, 5 and 12 of the Constitution, together with the Rome Convention, had been infringed referred not to the Court of Appeal’s judgment but to the judgment of the Florina Court of First Instance; even supposing that the applicants had put forward a ground of appeal based on Article 559 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it would have had to be dismissed as vague since they had not stated in what way the Court of Appeal had made a mistake in interpreting or applying those provisions.', 'relevant domestic law', 'A.

The application must be accompanied by the document establishing the association, a list of the names of the members of the management committee and the memorandum of association dated and signed by the committee’s members.”', 'Article 80 Memorandum of association', '“To be valid, the memorandum of association must specify (a) the object, name and headquarters of the association; (b) the conditions of admission, withdrawal and expulsion of its members, together with their rights and obligations; …”', 'Article 81 Decision to register an association', '“The Court of First Instance shall allow the application if it is satisfied that all the legal requirements have been complied with…”', 'Article 105 Dissolution of an association', '“The Court of First Instance shall order the dissolution of an association … (c) if the association pursues aims different from those laid down in its memorandum of association or if its object or its functioning prove to be contrary to law, morality or public order.”', 'C. Code of Civil Procedure', '19. The non-contentious procedure ( ekoussia dikeodossia ) followed by the courts when they examine, among other things, applications to register an association is governed by the following provisions:', 'Article 744', '“The court may of its own motion order any measure which might lead to the establishment of relevant facts, even if these are not mentioned in the parties’ submissions…”', 'Article 759 §§ 2 and 3', '“2. Where the court directs that evidence is to be taken, such evidence shall be brought by one of the parties.', '3. The court may of its own motion order any measure that it considers necessary for establishing the facts, even if in so doing it departs from the provisions governing the taking of evidence.”', 'Furthermore, Article 336 § 1 provides:', '“The court may, of its own motion and without directing that evidence is to be taken, have regard to matters which are so widely known that their truth cannot reasonably be put in doubt.”', 'Lastly, Article 345 allows a party who does not have to discharge the burden of proof to adduce refuting evidence.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '20. The applicants applied to the Commission on 16 November 1994. They alleged violations of Articles 6, 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention.', '21. On 24 June 1994 the Commission declared the application (no. 26695/95) admissible in respect of six of the seven applicants, the seventh, Mr Constantinos Gotsis, having died in the meantime. In its report of 11 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention, that it was unnecessary to consider whether there had been violations of Articles 6 and 14 and that no separate issue arose under Articles 9 and 10. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '22. In their memorial the applicants asked the Court to allow their application in its entirety and to order the Greek Government to pay compensation and legal expenses.', '23. The Government submitted that the application should be dismissed as inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies or as being manifestly unfounded or as being unfounded on the merits as to all the complaints.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'i. the government’s preliminary objections', 'A. Failure to exhaust domestic remedies', '24. The Government submitted that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies as they had failed to raise Articles 6, 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention in the national courts; in the Court of Cassation they had relied only on Article 2 (State’s obligation to respect and protect the inviolability of the person), Article 4 (equality before the law), Article 5 (free development of personality) and Article 12 (freedom of association) of the Greek Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Convention.', '25. The applicants maintained that it had not been possible to mention explicitly the complaints relating to Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention, particularly in the Court of Cassation, regard being had to the prevailing atmosphere at the time; the Greek courts and especially the Court of Cassation would have taken offence and rejected such allegations unceremoniously inasmuch as all the judiciary subscribed to the idea that there was no Macedonian minority in Greece and that the very mention of Macedonian consciousness amounted to treason.', '26. In its decision on admissibility the Commission considered that the applicants had raised in substance in the Court of Cassation the complaints they had brought before the Convention institutions.', '27. In its judgment in the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom case (13 August 1981, Series A no. 44) the Court held that Article 11, notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, could also be considered in the light of Articles 9 and 10. The protection of personal opinion afforded by those Articles in the shape of freedom of conscience and freedom of expression was also one of the purposes of freedom of association as guaranteed by Article 11 (ibid., p. 23, § 57).', 'The Court notes that in refusing to register the applicants’ association, the Florina Court of First Instance and the Salonika Court of Appeal relied partly on the fact that the applicants had publicly claimed to be of “Macedonian” ethnic origin and to have a “Macedonian national consciousness” and at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (“the CSCE”) in Copenhagen had disputed the Greek identity of Greek Macedonia (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).', 'In the circumstances of the case the Court considers that the applicants’ complaints under Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention also go to the very substance of Article 11, so that in the national courts the applicants did rely on grounds of equivalent effect within the meaning of the Court’s case-law.', 'As to the complaints under Article 6 § 1, inasmuch as they concern the way in which the national courts used certain evidence to refuse the application to register the association, they are identical with those raised by the applicants under Article 11.', 'This objection must therefore be dismissed.', 'B. Abuse of the right of individual petition', '28. Before the Commission the Government raised a plea of inadmissibility on the ground of abuse of the right of individual petition, alleging, among other things, that the applicants were trying to bring before the Convention institutions the dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (“the FYROM”) over the latter’s name. The Commission had not allowed the objection, taking the view, on the one hand, that it went to the merits of the case and, on the other, that “it would be failing in its duty under Article 19 of the Convention … if it were to refuse to examine the application on the basis of the possible impact, if any, that it might have on the dialogue between Greece and ‘the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’”.', 'Before the Court the Government again raised that objection, this time combining it with Article 17 of the Convention and maintaining that the objectives being pursued by the applicants through the instant case were contrary to the agreement concluded between Greece and the FYROM on 13 September 1995.', '29. The Court does not accept the Government’s argument and does not consider that Article 17 can apply as there is nothing in the relevant association’s memorandum of association (see paragraph 8 above) to warrant the conclusion that the association relied on the Convention to engage in activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in it (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 35, § 60).', 'ii. alleged violation of Article 11 of the convention', '30. The applicants alleged that the national courts’ refusal of their application to register their association had infringed their right to freedom of association, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.”', 'A. Whether there was an interference', '31. The Court considers, as the applicants and the Commission did, that the Greek courts’ refusal to register the applicants’ association amounts to an interference by the authorities with the applicants’ exercise of their right to freedom of association; the refusal deprived the applicants of any possibility of jointly or individually pursuing the aims they had laid down in the association’s memorandum of association and of thus exercising the right in question. This interference was not denied by the Government.', 'Justification for the interference', '32. Such an interference will contravene Article 11 unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving them.', '“Prescribed by law”', '33. In the applicants’ submission, the interference in question was not “prescribed by law” since, by Article 12 of the Constitution, freedom of association could not be made subject to a system of prior authorisation; that was why the legislature had made the registration of associations subject to purely formal requirements, as appeared from Articles 78 to 81 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 above). Under those provisions, the courts were obliged to grant recognition to an association if those requirements were satisfied.', '34. The Government maintained that the national courts had correctly interpreted and applied domestic law, in particular Article 81 of the Civil Code, according to which “the Court of First Instance shall allow the [registration] application if it is satisfied that all the legal requirements have been complied with…”; the inquisitorial nature of the non-contentious procedure which applied to the registration of associations (Articles 741, 744 and 759 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure) allowed the courts to obtain evidence of their own motion and to establish the facts decisive for the outcome of the proceedings.', '35. The Commission did not consider it necessary to determine this issue as it concluded that the interference in question was incompatible with Article 11 in other respects.', '36. The Court considers that the interference was “prescribed by law”, as Articles 79 to 81 of the Civil Code allowed the courts to refuse an application to register an association where they found that the validity of its memorandum of association was open to question. More especially, the Court notes like the Government that an association’s aim, as set out in its memorandum of association, must be the one really pursued by it and not be contrary to law, morality or public order; Article 105 of the Civil Code, moreover, provides for the dissolution of an association already constituted where it proves to be pursuing an aim different from the one laid down in its memorandum of association (see paragraph 18 above).', '2. Legitimate aim', '37. The Government submitted that the interference in question pursued several aims: the maintenance of national security, the prevention of disorder and the upholding of Greece’s cultural traditions and historical and cultural symbols.', '38. The Court is not persuaded that the last of those aims may constitute one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 11 § 2. Exceptions to freedom of association must be narrowly interpreted, such that the enumeration of them is strictly exhaustive and the definition of them necessarily restrictive.', '39. The Court notes nevertheless that the Salonika Court of Appeal based its decision on the conviction that the applicants intended to dispute the Greek identity of Macedonia and its inhabitants and undermine Greece’s territorial integrity. Having regard to the situation prevailing in the Balkans at the time and to the political friction between Greece and the FYROM (see paragraph 42 below), the Court accepts that the interference in issue was intended to protect national security and prevent disorder.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '40. The Court points out that the right to form an association is an inherent part of the right set forth in Article 11, even if that Article only makes express reference to the right to form trade unions. That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association’s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions.', 'Consequently, the exceptions set out in Article 11 are to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts.', 'When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 22, §§ 46 and 47).', '41. In the applicants’ submission, all the arguments put forward by the national courts and the Government against the association’s founders were baseless, vague and unproved and did not correspond to the concept of “pressing social need”.', 'There was nothing in the case file to suggest that any of the applicants had wished to undermine Greece’s territorial integrity, national security or public order. Mention of the consciousness of belonging to a minority and the preservation and development of a minority’s culture could not be said to constitute a threat to “democratic society”. Similarly, the presence of some of the founders at the CSCE in Copenhagen could not be interpreted as an attack on national security, since the Greek Government themselves had, by signing all the relevant CSCE documents, recognised that citizens could take part in such proceedings. Nor had Mr Sidiropoulos in any way challenged the Greek identity of the Greek province of Macedonia; he had merely claimed that the Macedonian minority there was oppressed.', 'Furthermore, the allegation that the association’s founders were plotting against Greece was unfounded. The press article that referred to a “directive” from Slav organisations abroad was manifestly untrue and a complete fabrication; that was apparent from the very use of the word “directive”, which was not a current term in the latter part of the twentieth century, and from the fact that the Greek Government had not to date confirmed the existence of such a directive. The irresponsible publications of a newspaper could not be used as evidence by a court, or indeed by the government of a State which respected the rule of law.', 'Territorial integrity, national security and public order were not threatened by the activities of an association whose aim was to promote a region’s culture, even supposing that it also aimed partly to promote the culture of a minority; the existence of minorities and different cultures in a country was a historical fact that a “democratic society” had to tolerate and even protect and support according to the principles of international law.', '42. The Government maintained that the national authorities had been right to refuse to register the applicants’ association. More specifically, the Florina Court of First Instance and the Salonika Court of Appeal had made an acceptable assessment of the circumstances of the case and had reached the reasonable conclusion that the association’s real aim was quite different from the one referred to in its memorandum of association. In order to reach that view, the judges of those courts had, of their own motion, taken into consideration as evidence – as Articles 741, 744 and 759 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure entitled them to do in such proceedings – certain press articles and matters of common knowledge such as the threat to Greece that the FYROM’s propaganda against it represented at the time, the attempted “ Slavicisation ” of the term “Macedonia” by that State, certain provisions of that State’s Constitution and the systematic campaign to promote the idea of a “United Macedonia”.', 'Furthermore, the courts had noted that clause 4 of the association’s memorandum of association provided that acceptance of its principles was an essential prerequisite for becoming a member, without however stating those principles, such that potential members ran the risk of being “trapped” as soon as they had joined. The association’s name was also likely to cause confusion, since the applicants had sought to conceal the type of culture to which they referred; it was only before the Commission that the applicants had revealed for the first time which ethnic group they really believed they belonged to. The deceptive name “Home of Macedonian Civilisation” was part of a propaganda exercise whose objective was to create a favourable climate for disputing the Greek identity of Macedonia and sustain irredentist aspirations.', 'Relying on the Court’s case-law, the Government emphasised that the authorities were better placed than the international court to assess whether an interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. They submitted that some respect should be paid to the authorities’ judgment when they weighed conflicting public and individual interests in view of their special knowledge of the country and their general responsibility under national law. Given the breadth of their margin of appreciation, in particular where matters affecting national security were concerned, the Greek courts had in the instant case satisfied the criterion of proportionality.', '43. The Commission, having examined the evidence produced to the domestic courts, considered that it had not been established that the applicants had harboured separatist intentions. Admittedly, the national courts could reasonably have concluded that the association’s true aim was to promote the idea that there was a “Macedonian” minority in Greece and that the rights of that minority’s members were not fully respected. However, in the Commission’s opinion, that would not in itself have justified restricting the applicants’ right to freedom of association; although the applicants had indeed stated that they had a “Macedonian” national consciousness, there was nothing to indicate that they had advocated the use of violence or of undemocratic or unconstitutional means. The Commission concluded that the reasons adduced by the domestic authorities to justify the interference had not been “relevant and sufficient” and that the interference had not been “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued”.', '44. The Court notes, in the first place, that the aims of the association called “Home of Macedonian Civilisation”, as set out in its memorandum of association, were exclusively to preserve and develop the traditions and folk culture of the Florina region (see paragraph 8 above). Such aims appear to the Court to be perfectly clear and legitimate; the inhabitants of a region in a country are entitled to form associations in order to promote the region’s special characteristics, for historical as well as economic reasons. Even supposing that the founders of an association like the one in the instant case assert a minority consciousness, the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE (Section IV) of 29 June 1990 and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe of 21 November 1990 – which Greece has signed – allow them to form associations to protect their cultural and spiritual heritage.', 'In the second place, in justifying its refusal of the application for registration, the Salonika Court of Appeal decided that it had “good reasons … to believe that the purpose of using the term ‘Macedonian’ [was] to dispute the Greek identity of Macedonia and its inhabitants by indirect and therefore underhand means, and discern[ ed ] in it an intention on the part of the founders to undermine Greece’s territorial integrity”.', 'In reaching that decision, the Court of Appeal, of its own motion, took into consideration as evidence material which the applicants maintained they had not been able to challenge during the proceedings as it had not been placed in the case file.', '45. The Court reiterates that the taking of evidence is governed primarily by the rules of domestic law and that it is in principle for the national courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among many other authorities, the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, § 43).', 'However, careful study of the press articles in question (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above), which had a decisive influence on the outcome of the proceedings, shows that they reported matters some of which were unconnected with the applicants and drew inferences derived from a subjective assessment by the authors of the articles. Relying on those articles and having regard to the political dispute that then dominated relations between Greece and the FYROM (the latter of which had not yet even proclaimed its independence at the material time), the national courts held that the applicants and the association they wished to found represented a danger to Greece’s territorial integrity.', 'That statement, however, was based on a mere suspicion as to the true intentions of the association’s founders and the activities it might have engaged in once it had begun to function.', 'The Court also takes into account in this context the fact that Greek law does not lay down a system of preventive review for setting up non-profit-making associations. Article 12 of the Constitution provides that the forming of associations cannot be made subject to prior authorisation (see paragraph 17 above); Article 81 of the Civil Code allows the courts merely to review lawfulness and not to review desirability (see paragraph 18 above).', '46. In the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above (p. 35, § 58) the Court held that it could not rule out that a political party’s programme might conceal objectives and intentions different from the ones it proclaimed. To verify that it did not, the content of the programme had to be compared with the party’s actions and the positions it defended.', 'Similarly, in the instant case the Court does not rule out that, once founded, the association might, under cover of the aims mentioned in its memorandum of association, have engaged in activities incompatible with those aims. Such a possibility, which the national courts saw as a certainty, could hardly have been belied by any practical action as, having never existed, the association did not have time to take any action. If the possibility had become a reality, the authorities would not have been powerless; under Article 105 of the Civil Code, the Court of First Instance could order that the association should be dissolved if it subsequently pursued an aim different from the one laid down in its memorandum of association or if its functioning proved to be contrary to law, morality or public order (see paragraph 18 above).', '47. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the refusal to register the applicants’ association was disproportionate to the objectives pursued. That being so, there has been a violation of Article 11.', 'alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 of the convention', '48. The applicants also alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which provides:', '“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations …, everyone is entitled to a fair … hearing … by an … impartial tribunal…”', 'According to them, the Greek courts had lacked objectivity and impartiality in using in their decisions expressions and terms degrading to the applicants’ person, language and origin. Furthermore, they had relied of their own motion on evidence that was not in the case file and had not ordered any supplementary investigative measures as they were required to do by the Code of Civil Procedure; they had thus infringed not only the relevant provisions of domestic law but also the right to a fair trial guaranteed in Article 6 § 1.', '49. The Commission, having held that Article 11 of the Convention had been contravened on the ground, among others, that the domestic courts should not have reached their conclusions without ordering further evidence to be taken, considered it unnecessary to ascertain whether there had also been a violation of Article 6 § 1.', '50. The Court notes that the applicants’ complaints under Article 6 § 1 are largely the same as those raised under Article 11. Having regard to its decision in relation to that Article, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine them.', 'iv. alleged violations of articles 9, 10 and 14 of the convention', '51. Lastly, the applicants asserted that the reason why the establishment of their association had been prohibited lay in the origin and consciousness of some of its founders and also in the fact that they had publicly expressed the opinion that they belonged to a minority. They relied on Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention, which provide:', 'Article 9', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.', '2. Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', 'Article 10', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'Article 14', '“ The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status .”', '52. The Court notes, as the Commission did, that this complaint relates to the same facts as the ones based on Article 11. Having regard to the conclusion in paragraph 47 above, it does not consider that it must deal with it.', 'v. application of Article 50 of the convention', '53. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '54. The applicants pleaded non-pecuniary damage that they said did not arise only from the sadness caused them by the refusal of their application to register the association. The damage had social and political dimensions, since the refusal was accompanied by insulting and degrading expressions which had been a slur on the applicants’ person, had influenced their relations with a section of Florina society and had had repercussions on their private and professional lives. They sought 15,000,000 drachmas (GRD) each, that is to say a total of GRD 90,000,000.', '55. The Government conceded that there had been damage but maintained that as the association was a non-profit-making one, it could not claim financial compensation.', '56. The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view.', '57. The Court accepts that the applicants sustained non-pecuniary damage. It considers it sufficiently compensated, however, by the finding of a violation of Article 11.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '58. For costs and expenses the applicants sought GRD 9,295,000, GRD 1,085,000 of which were for the proceedings in the domestic courts and GRD 8,210,000 of which were for those before the Convention institutions.', '59. The Government said they were prepared to reimburse any costs that had been necessarily incurred, were reasonable as to quantum and could be vouched for.', '60. The Delegate of the Commission did not put forward any opinion.', '61. The Court considers the costs incurred in the domestic courts to be reasonable. On the other hand, there was no hearing before the Commission and the applicants did not file a memorial in the proceedings before the Court. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards them the sum of GRD 4,000,000.', 'C. Default interest', '62. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Greece at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 6% per annum.']",2,gr,001-58205,0

Mr Lambert, a French national born in 1957, lives at Buzet - sur -Tarn.', 'A. The judicial investigation and interception of the applicant’s telephone conversations', '8. In the course of a judicial investigation into offences of theft, burglary, handling the proceeds of theft and aggravated theft, and unlawful possession of Class 4 weapons and ammunition, an investigating judge at Riom issued a warrant on 11 December 1991 instructing the gendarmerie to arrange for the telephone line of a certain R.B. to be tapped until 31 January 1992.', '9. By means of standard-form written instructions (“ soit transmis ”) dated 31 January, 28 February and 30 March 1992, the investigating judge extended the duration of the telephone tapping until 29 February, 31 March and 31 May 1992 respectively.', '10. As a result of this tapping and the interception of some of his conversations, the applicant was charged with handling the proceeds of aggravated theft; he was held in custody from 15 May to 30 November 1992, when he was released subject to judicial supervision.', 'B. The proceedings brought by the applicant', 'The application to the Indictment Division of the Riom Court of Appeal', '11. In an application of 5 April 1993 the applicant’s lawyer applied to the Indictment Division of the Riom Court of Appeal for a ruling that the extensions of 31 January and 28 February 1992 were invalid, arguing that they had been ordered merely by standard-form written instructions without any reference to the offences which justified the telephone tapping, and that the four-month period which could have been authorised in the warrant of 11 December 1991 had expired on 11 April 1992.', '12. In a judgment of 25 May 1993 the Riom Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Lambert’s application on the following grounds:', '“… by Articles 100, 100-1 and 100-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 15 below] taken together, decisions to intercept telecommunications messages must be in writing and contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored, the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception, which must not exceed four months but may be extended subject to the same formal requirements and maximum duration.', 'In the instant case it is beyond doubt that the warrant of 11 December 1991 complies with the requirements of the above-mentioned Articles in so far as it specifies the number of the link to be monitored, a duration of less than four months and the offences that justified interception, the criminal penalties for which were greater than two years’ imprisonment.', 'It is also clear that the decisions to extend the duration of the interception, which were issued in standard-form instructions, were in writing and mentioned the number of the link concerned; that they are an extension of the original decision of 11 December 1991 and necessarily referred to it; and that the duration of their validity was less than four months. They thus comply with the requirements of Article 100-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”', '2. The appeal to the Court of Cassation', '13. The applicant appealed on a point of law against the judgment of 25 May 1993, arguing, as his only ground of appeal, that Article 8 of the Convention and Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been infringed because the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping in issue, by means of standard-form written instructions, did not contain any reasons.', '14. In a judgment of 27 September 1993 the Court of Cassation affirmed the decision appealed against and held that the applicant had “no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party’s telephone line was extended” and that accordingly “the grounds of appeal, which contest[ ed ] the grounds on which the Indictment Division [had] wrongly considered it must examine [the] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them, [were] inadmissible”.']","['RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', '15. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 91-646 of 10 July 1991 on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages) read as follows:', 'Article 100', '“In the case of a serious crime or other major offence attracting a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, the investigating judge may, where necessary for the investigation, order the interception, recording and transcription of telecommunications messages. Such operations shall be carried out under his authority and supervision.', 'Decisions to intercept shall be in writing. They shall not constitute judicial decisions and no appeal shall lie against them.”', 'Article 100-1', '“Decisions made pursuant to Article 100 shall contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored, the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception.”', 'Article 100-2', '“Such decisions shall be valid for a maximum duration of four months. Their validity may be extended only subject to the same procedural requirements and maximum duration.”', 'Article 100-3', '“The investigating judge or a senior detective ( officier de police judiciaire ) acting on his instructions may call upon any qualified official of any department or body under the authority or supervision of the Minister for Telecommunications, or any qualified official of an authorised network operator or provider of telecommunications services, for the purpose of installing monitoring equipment.”', 'Article 100-4', '“The investigating judge or the senior detective acting on his instructions shall draw up a report on each of the interception and recording operations. This report shall give the date and time of the beginning and end of each operation.”', 'Article 100-5', '“The investigating judge or the senior detective acting on his instructions shall transcribe messages useful for establishing the truth. A report of the transcription shall be drawn up and the transcription placed in the case file.', 'Any messages in a foreign language shall be transcribed in French with the help of an interpreter called upon for this purpose.”', 'Article 100-6', '“The Public Prosecutor or Principal Public Prosecutor shall ensure that the recordings are destroyed when prosecution becomes time-barred.', 'A formal report of the destruction shall be drawn up.”', 'Article 100-7', '“The telephone line of a member of Parliament or senator shall not be tapped unless and until the Speaker of the relevant House has been informed by the investigating judge.', 'The home or office telephone lines of a member of the Bar shall not be tapped unless and until the chairman of the Bar has been informed by the investigating judge.', 'Any interception carried out in breach of the requirements of this Article shall be null and void.”', 'proceedings before the commission', '16. Mr Lambert applied to the Commission on 8 February 1994. He alleged that the interception of certain telephone conversations which were used against him amounted to interference with his private life and correspondence, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention; he also maintained that he had not had an effective remedy in the Court of Cassation, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention.', '17. The Commission declared the application (no. 23618/94) admissible on 2 September 1996. In its report of 1 July 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion by twenty votes to twelve that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and by twenty-seven votes to five that it was unnecessary to consider the case under Article 13 of the Convention also. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'final submissions to the court', '18. In their memorial the Government submitted that “the application lodged by Mr Lambert should be dismissed”.', '19. The applicant asked the Court to', '“hold that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the … Convention;', 'award him 500,000 francs by way of just satisfaction”.', 'as to the law', 'i. alleged violation of Article 8 of the convention', '20. Mr Lambert submitted that the Court of Cassation’s decision to refuse him any standing to complain of the interception of some of his telephone conversations, on the ground that it was a third party’s line that had been tapped, had infringed Article 8 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', 'A. Whether there was any interference', '21. The Court points out that as telephone conversations are covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” within the meaning of Article 8, the admitted measure of interception amounted to “interference by a public authority” with the exercise of a right secured to the applicant in paragraph 1 of that Article (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 30, § 64; Kruslin v. France and Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A and B, p. 20, § 26, and p. 52, § 25; Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, pp. 1016–17, § 48; and Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ II, p. 540, § 53). In this connection, it is of little importance', 'that the telephone tapping in question was carried out on the line of a third party.', 'The Government did not dispute this.', 'B. Justification for the interference', '22. Such interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and furthermore is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them.', '1. Was the interference “in accordance with the law”?', '23. The expression “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 requires, firstly, that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law; it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law.', '(a) Whether there was a statutory basis in French law', '24. The Court notes that the investigating judge ordered the telephone tapping in question on the basis of Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above).', '25. The interference complained of therefore had a statutory basis in French law.', '(b) “Quality of the law”', '26. The second requirement which derives from the phrase “in accordance with the law” – the accessibility of the law – does not raise any problem in the instant case.', '27. As to the “foreseeability of the law”, the Government maintained that following the Court’s judgments in the Kruslin and Huvig cases (see paragraph 21 above), the French legislature had remedied the omissions and weaknesses of domestic law on telephone tapping by adopting safeguards in respect of the persons whose telephones could be tapped, the duration of interception, the requirements for drawing up reports, and the communication or destruction of recordings.', '28. The Court considers, as the Commission did, that Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, inserted by the Law of 10 July 1991 on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages, lay down clear, detailed rules and specify with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities (see the Kruslin and Huvig judgments cited above, pp. 24–25, §§ 35–36, and p. 56, §§ 34–35, respectively, and, as the most recent authority and mutatis mutandis, the Kopp judgment cited above, pp. 541–43, §§ 62–75).', '2. Purpose and necessity of the interference', '29. The Court shares the opinion of the Government and the Commission and considers that the interference was designed to establish the truth in connection with criminal proceedings and therefore to prevent disorder.', '30. It remains to be ascertained whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving those objectives. Under the Court’s settled case-law, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of such necessity, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, pp. 37–38, § 97, and the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, § 28).', '31. When considering the necessity of interference, the Court stated in its Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978 (Series A no. 28, pp. 23 and 25–26, §§ 50, 54 and 55):', '“The Court must be satisfied that, whatever system of surveillance is adopted, there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. This assessment has only a relative character: it depends on … [among other things] the kind of remedy provided by the national law.', '…', 'It therefore has to be determined whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the ‘interference’ resulting from the contested legislation to what is ‘necessary in a democratic society’.', '… In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. One of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the rule of law, which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention… The rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual’s rights should be subject to an effective control…”', '32. The applicant said that he had wished to complain of the circumstances in which the investigating judge had ordered the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping (see paragraph 13 above), but the Court of Cassation’s decision had deprived him of any practical possibility of using the remedies provided by law to penalise irregularities committed by the authorities.', '33. In the Government’s submission, the interference complained of had been “necessary in a democratic society”. In the instant case the telephone tapping had been one of the principal means of investigation contributing to the establishment of the truth and, in particular, to proving the involvement of various individuals, including the applicant, in large-scale illicit dealing in furniture. Furthermore, Mr Lambert had been able to avail himself of a remedy in the Indictment Division, and a further remedy in the Court of Cassation was quite unnecessary to satisfy the requirement of “effective control”.', '34. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether an “effective control” was available to Mr Lambert to challenge the telephone tapping to which he had been made subject.', '35. It notes, firstly, that the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 27 September 1993 held that the applicant had “no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party’s telephone line was extended” and that accordingly “the grounds of appeal, which contest[ ed ] the grounds on which the Indictment Division [had] wrongly considered it must examine [the] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them, [were] inadmissible”.', '36. In its ruling the Court of Cassation therefore went beyond the ground relied on by the applicant concerning the extension of the duration of the telephone tapping and held that a victim of the tapping of a telephone line not his own has no standing to invoke the protection of national law or Article 8 of the Convention. It concluded that in the instant case the Indictment Division had been wrong to examine the objections of invalidity raised by the applicant as the telephone line being monitored had not been his own.', '37. Admittedly, the applicant had been able to avail himself of a remedy in respect of the disputed point in the Indictment Division, which held that the investigating judge’s extension of the duration of the telephone tapping had been in accordance with Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 12 above), and it is not the Court’s function to express an opinion on the interpretation of domestic law, which is primarily for the national courts to interpret (see the Kruslin and Huvig judgments cited above, p. 21, § 29, and p. 53, § 28, respectively). However, the Court of Cassation, the guardian of national law, criticised the Indictment Division for having examined the merits of Mr Lambert’s application.', '38. As the Court has already said (see paragraph 28 above), the provisions of the Law of 1991 governing telephone tapping satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention and those laid down in the Kruslin and Huvig judgments. However, it has to be recognised that the Court of Cassation’s reasoning could lead to decisions whereby a very large number of people are deprived of the protection of the law, namely all those who have conversations on a telephone line other than their own. That would in practice render the protective machinery largely devoid of substance.', '39. That was the case with the applicant, who did not enjoy the effective protection of national law, which does not make any distinction according to whose line is being tapped (Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure – see paragraph 15 above).', '40. The Court therefore considers, like the Commission, that the applicant did not have available to him the “effective control” to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law and which would have been capable of restricting the interference in question to what was “necessary in a democratic society”.', '41. There has consequently been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.', 'II. alleged violation of Article 13 of the convention', '42. The applicant also alleged a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:', '“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”', '43. In view of the preceding conclusion (see paragraph 41 above), the Court does not consider that it need rule on the complaint in question.', 'III. application of Article 50 of the convention', '44. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '45. Mr Lambert sought 500,000 French francs (FRF) for non-pecuniary damage.', '46. The Government considered that any finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction.', '47. The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view on the matter.', '48. The Court considers that the applicant undeniably sustained non-pecuniary damage and awards him the sum of FRF 10,000 under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '49. The applicant also claimed FRF 15,000 in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court.', '50. The Government considered that the amount claimed was not unreasonable and wished to leave the matter to the Court’s discretion.', '51. The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view.', '52. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and with reference to its usual criteria, the Court awards the sum claimed.', 'C. Default interest', '53. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.36% per annum.']",2,fr,001-58219,0

In collaboration with Mr Blanc, a professor at the University of Lausanne and a technical adviser at the Lausanne Federal Institute of Technology, Mr Hertel carried out a study of the effects on human beings of the consumption of food prepared in microwave ovens. Over a period of two months, the blood of eight volunteers who followed a macrobiotic diet was analysed before and after consuming eight types of food (some were cooked or defrosted in a microwave oven and the others were raw or cooked by conventional means).

It was dated June 1991 and entitled Vergleichende Untersuchungen über die Beeinflussung des Menschen durch konventionell und im Mikrowellenofen aufbereitete Nahrung (“Comparative study of the effects on human beings of food prepared by conventional means and in microwave ovens”), and it concluded as follows (translation of an extract from the summary in French that was appended to it):', '“…', '… a significant relation was established between the absorption of microwave energy by the food and its transfer to the volunteers’ blood.

We would not be surprised if the researchers who have had the courage to defend the findings of their research were attacked in their turn, seeing that millions or even thousands of millions are at stake.

It was accepted that such food was neither better nor worse than food cooked by conventional means. But, to our knowledge, no research attempted to answer the question ‘harmful/not harmful?’', 'Harmfulness demonstrated', 'Today the answer is unequivocal: the use of microwaves for preparing food is harmful. The microwaves impair the organic substances and cause alarming changes in the blood of those who consume them, notably anaemia and precancerous conditions. Those are the findings of the study carried out by Professor Bernard H Blanc and Dr Hans U. Hertel.', 'Clinical research', '…', 'Eight food variants', '…', 'Incriminating results', 'Food treated by microwaves caused significant changes in the volunteers’ blood (a drop in haemoglobin levels, an increase in the haematocrit, in leucocytes and in the levels of cholesterol particularly of the HDL and LDL forms). As regards lymphocytes, the drop was more rapid and more marked where the food was a vegetable prepared with microwaves than it was with other variants.', 'Such changes in the blood count appear to indicate the initial stage of a pathological process such as occurs in a precancerous phase. As the experiment covered only two months, it is reasonable to wonder about the longer-term effects, a fortiori if the effects of the radiation persist.', 'Long-term effects', 'Does food irradiated by microwaves absorb the radiation and transfer it to the organism it is supposed to feed? To answer this crucial question, the researchers applied a known bacterial bioluminescence method which allows the degree of stimulation or inhibition of bacteria in the blood to be measured. The results clearly show that irradiated food irradiates in its turn and that this prolonged effect on the blood must be taken seriously since the phenomenon is one of direct irradiation, whose consequences are only too well known.', 'Measuring the hidden dangers', '…', 'Burying one’s head in the sand', 'The scientific literature on the damage caused to living organisms by direct microwave radiation is particularly voluminous. It is so revealing that it is surprising that the use of microwaves has not long since been replaced by another technique that is less dangerous and better suited to nature. The pernicious effects of microwaves range from the destruction of cell membranes and cell respiration and cell-division disorders to haemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), leukaemia and the blockage of natural cycles.', 'Aligned-covered', '…', 'Cathodic constraints', '…', 'Living beings in danger!', 'Not a single atom, molecule or cell can, while remaining whole, resist destructive forces of such power, even if that power is no greater than 1 milliwatt.

Introduction', '…', 'Tolerance thresholds', '… The harmfulness of microwaves, and above all their thermic effect on biological systems, was discovered very early on (1944). Tolerance thresholds were accordingly established, for microwave ovens as for other applications, in order to avoid the undesirable effects of any leaking radiation.', 'Harmful or not harmful?', 'The quality of food prepared with microwaves has not been officially questioned. It is simply accepted that food prepared in this way is neither better nor worse than food cooked by conventional means. So far as is known, there has not yet been any scientific research which has clarified the possible effects on health of food defrosted or cooked in microwave ovens. Given the widespread use of this method of cooking, is it not appropriate that the question ‘harmful/not harmful’ should at last be answered scientifically?', 'In this study various foodstuffs were accordingly examined firstly in their raw state and secondly in technologically prepared form, defrosted or cooked by conventional means and with microwaves.', '2. Description and mode of action of microwaves on living beings through direct radiation and through food prepared in microwave ovens', '…', 'Well-known pernicious effects', 'The scientific literature on the damage to living organisms by direct microwave radiation is particularly extensive. It is so revealing that it is surprising that the use of microwaves has not long since been replaced by another technique better attuned to nature. The pernicious effects of microwaves range from the destruction of cell membranes and cell respiration and cell-division disorders to haemolysis, leukaemia and genetic changes including the blocking of natural cycles.', 'Infernal radiation', 'The artificial production of microwaves is based on the principle of alternating current. Matter (atoms, molecules, cells) which is irradiated by this electromagnetic radiation thus undergoes, according to the radiation frequency, between one and a hundred thousand million polarity reversals or oscillations per second. Not a single atom, molecule or cell of a living organism would be able to resist destructive forces of such power, even if it was only of the order of 1 milliwatt.', 'Mind the water!', 'Of all the matter and substances in nature which are polar, the hydrogen in water reacts with the greatest sensitivity. …', 'Mr 80% water, beware!', '… the biological effects of artificially created microwaves will be correlated above all with the generation of heat by friction. And since plants, animals and human beings are 80% water, it is not difficult to imagine the biological dangers of such microwaves. …', 'Easy prey for viruses', 'In addition to the thermic effects of microwaves there is also an athermic effect …, of which little official notice has been taken until now. It is not measurable like the thermic effect. But under the influence of these two effects, molecules are shattered, their structure deformed and their natural functions perverted. Such effects are probably qualitative. This pernicious effect at the qualitative level and the weakening of organic systems, such as cell membranes, are used in genetic engineering to gain access to genes. In this way the genes can be artificially altered by radiation. The cells are thus broken into and the energy tension between the outside and the inside of the cell is removed. A cell weakened in this way becomes an easy prey for viruses and fungi.', 'Danger! Cell poison', 'If the stress were to be maintained, inter alia by microwaves, the repair mechanism would break down and the cell, for want of energy, would be obliged to switch to anaerobic respiration. In place of H 2 O and CO 2 (aerobic respiration) there appears, among other things, the cell poison H 2 O 2 and CO as in a cancer cell. This is why leaked radiation from microwave ovens is so dangerous. Yet safety standards vary from country to country. This shows only too well that the problem is far from being resolved, especially as microwave ovens, as we know very well, are not always reliably sealed and become less leakproof with use, as experience has shown.', 'Danger to the eyes, lungs and endocrine system', 'The microwaves, which in the light of our scientific knowledge can be identified as the main cause, together with artificial radioactivity, of ‘electrosmog’, impair the functions of all living organisms, functions which depend on natural fields. ... It can be expected that these effects will be detectable in the blood count.', 'As powerful as a television transmitter', 'Basically, microwaves can produce the same changes in form and structure in food prepared in microwave ovens as they can in living organisms. …', 'Microwave transmitters on the loose in the organism', 'Through this irradiation of food the structure of the molecules is likewise broken down and deformed and new substances with lasting effects are created about which science knows very little. Furthermore, this powerful, artificially produced radiation will be induced in the food, which in its turn, by a well-known electromagnetic process, will become a source and carrier of the radiation. The actual process of induction in organic matter is not entirely understood.', 'A phenomenon unknown in nature', '…', 'A proper clinical study', 'Whether and to what extent microwaves are harmful or harmless can at present be determined only by an indirect method – by assessing the effects on living organisms. The present research, based on a method of that kind, is designed to measure the effects of different foodstuffs, cooked by conventional means and with microwaves, as interpreted through changes in the parameters of the blood count of volunteers.', '3. Research plan', '…', '4. Analysis and observation of the food variants', '…', '5. Discussion of the results', '5.1. General findings', 'All the measures (original values and control values) of erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrits and leucocytes are at the bottom of the normal range of variation. A haematological interpretation shows up indications of a tendency to anaemia among the volunteers.', 'That situation becomes more marked during the second month, when, together with a further deterioration of the blood parameters, an increased level of cholesterol becomes apparent.', '…', '5.2. Table 5 summarises the results', '(See Table 5)', 'The differences in effects on the human organism of food prepared by conventional means or with microwaves are negligible for a single serving. Certain tendencies, however, are visible, in some circumstances significant ones, statistically confirmed by the Rank method.', 'Appearance of anaemia', 'In the vegetables prepared with microwaves (variant 7) the erythrocytes tend to increase. Among other blood factors, the erythrocytes have the property of being mobilised (probably from the spleen) and rapidly increasing in number in the blood under the influence of short-term stress. If the stress continues, the number falls. Anaemic tendencies thus appear.', 'Differences in food transit', 'In unpasteurised milk (variant 1) haemoglobin levels tend to fall, in vegetables cooked with microwaves (variant 8) they drop significantly. Haemoglobin deficits are to be regarded as stress indicators. The three foodstuffs in question cause stress in the human organism. The digestion of unpasteurised milk is radically different from that of heated milk. The transit of unpasteurised milk through the stomach, because of its coagulation and breakdown, is lengthy and is associated with some stress for the organism. This process, however, is natural, normal and not toxic.', 'Aggressiveness of milk heated with microwaves', 'The transit of heat-treated milk through the stomach and intestines is generally more rapid than that of unpasteurised milk. The proteins are transformed to such an extent that they coagulate into magma more quickly. But in this accelerated transit they are not fully broken down. The heated milk thus has a less stressful effect on the organism but its nutritional value is also less. Milk heated with microwaves, on the other hand, unlike conventionally heated milk, clearly creates a situation of stress which is in no way comparable to that caused by unpasteurised milk.', 'Rheumatism, fever and pituitary insufficiency', 'Haemoglobin concentration and corpuscular content react like haemoglobin. There is a significant drop in the levels above all in foodstuffs prepared with microwaves (variants 4, 7 and 8). These losses also indicate anaemia. In the reference literature they are associated with microcytosis (haemoglobin content), poisoning (chemical, radiation) and their consequences: rheumatism, fever, pituitary insufficiency, etc.', 'The haematocrit increases partly significantly in vegetables prepared with microwaves (variants 7 and 8). While the low haematocrit values may indicate anaemia – as a result of repeated pernicious influences – increasing values are more a sign of acute poisoning.', 'Beware, leucocytes on the increase!', 'The increase in leucocytes, which exceed the normal daily variations – after consuming food, for example – is taken very seriously by haematologists. Leucocytes are particularly sensitive to external challenges. They are often a sign of pathogenic action on the organic system by poisoning and non-infectious damage to the (cell) tissues. The increase in leucocytes in food prepared with microwaves (variants 4, 7 and 8) is greater than with the other variants. The consequences of such a challenge can easily be imagined.', 'Decreasing lymphocytes', 'Lymphocytes in principle react to external challenges (poisons, for example) in the opposite way to leucocytes. They tend to decrease. They react similarly to haemoglobin. The effect of a challenge is above all observable in unpasteurised milk (variant 1) and in vegetables prepared with microwaves (variants 7 and 8). In these cases – initially in every instance – the lymphocytes decrease more significantly than with the other variants.', 'Cholesterol, the result of stress', 'Although, according to accepted opinion, cholesterol levels rise only slowly and over a long period, cholesterol and, more particularly, its HDL and LDL constituents increase after consumption of vegetables cooked with microwaves (variants 7 and 8). On the other hand, with milk (variants 1 to 4) the cholesterol level tends to remain unchanged, and in the case of unpasteurised milk (variant 1) it even drops significantly. This most interesting finding bears out the most recent scientific knowledge, according to which cholesterol, in a situation of acute challenge, can also increase rapidly owing not so much to the cholesterol content of food as to an external challenge.', 'Cholesterol out of nothing', 'Such challenges, as the present research shows, are also possible through foodstuffs which contain practically no cholesterol. Artificial radiation and poisons (antigens) have a cholesterol-forming effect. In an electromagnetic field, cholesterol undergoes changes in its crystal structure and is eliminated from the blood in the form of a deposit. In cancer patients the blood cholesterol level is always very high. This is why a raised blood cholesterol level may be regarded as an obvious sign of a precancerous condition or a developing cancerous condition.', 'Loss of iron', 'Iron levels tend to increase in vegetables prepared with microwaves (variants 7 and 8), contrary to all the other variants. Haemolysis might be thought to be the cause of this phenomenon, being itself a consequence of damage to the membranes of blood cells. Research undertaken up to now does not enable any significant conclusions to be drawn.', 'Established pathogenic disorders', 'In sum, the results obtained from analysing the blood count of the volunteers fed on food prepared with microwaves to the exclusion of the other variants show changes which bear witness to pathogenic disorders. They present a pattern which might correspond to the beginning of a cancerous development and deserves attention. These results match the effects of chemico-physiological deformations observed in living cells subjected to microwave irradiation.', 'Microwaves on the loose in the blood', 'The luminescence of bacteria in contact with the serum of volunteers who had consumed food irradiated by microwaves is significantly higher than that produced by the blood of other volunteers fed on the other food variants. The possibility of a transfer of the radiation energy by induction, through the consumption of foodstuffs prepared with microwaves, and their effect on a living organism, in this instance the blood, must be considered.', 'Such physical phenomena are scientifically proved. The destructive power of microwaves through direct irradiation, as attested in the scientific literature (see the previous paragraph), could also have harmful effects on human beings through indirect radiation, through irradiated food.”', '14. Half of page 3 is taken up with a drawing representing a microwave oven, through the glass panel of which can be seen the head of the Reaper. The same picture, reduced in size, appears on pages 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.', '15. On 27 January 1992 Professor Blanc made the following statement:', '“Statement concerning false information about foodstuffs treated or prepared in microwave ovens which appeared recently in Franz Weber Journal (January-March 1992) [and] Raum & Zeit (Munich, January-February 1992).', 'While the published figures and the description of the preliminary experiment are correct, I totally dissociate myself from the presentation and interpretation of the preliminary exploratory experiment carried out in 1989, which was published without my consent by the co-author of the study in the journals cited above.', 'The results obtained do not in any circumstances justify drawing any conclusions as to the harmful effects of food treated with microwaves or a predisposition to the appearance of a given pathological condition. As the objective publication of the study in a forthcoming issue of the periodical Alimenta (spring 1992) will show, only one conclusion is unavoidable, namely that it is necessary to undertake, as a matter of urgency, multidisciplinary and multifactorial basic research on the effects on (certain parameters of) health of the consumption of food treated with microwaves in comparison with food prepared using other food technologies or culinary techniques.', 'The major unknown factor is the source of the funds needed to finance such a study.”', 'B. The proceedings brought against Mr Weber and Mr Hertel by the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Suppliers of Household Electrical Appliances', 'The proceedings against Mr Weber', '16. On 18 March 1992 the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Suppliers of Household Electrical Appliances (“the MHEA”) applied to the President of the Vevey District Court under the Federal Unfair Competition Act (“the UCA”) for an interim order prohibiting Mr Franz Weber, on pain of the penalties provided in Article 292 of the Criminal Code, “from using … the image of a man’s skeleton or any other image suggesting the idea of death … associated with the graphic, photographic, oral or written representation of a microwave oven”, “from stating … that microwave ovens must be abolished and their use banned”, “from stating … that scientific research proves what a hazard food that has been exposed to radiation in a microwave oven is to health and backs up the Journal Franz Weber ” or “from stating … that microwave ovens must all be destroyed without exception because food is harmed by these dangerous appliances to such an extent that it causes, in those who consume it, a change in the blood count and leads to anaemia and a precancerous stage”.', '17. In an order of 7 April 1992 the President of the Vevey District Court dismissed the application. Firstly, he expressed doubts as to the applicability of the UCA, noting, in particular, the following:', '“… [the UCA as amended is] not … applicable to all forms of unfair behaviour regardless of the sphere in which it occurs. Its purpose is in fact only to ensure fair, undistorted competition (section 1 UCA) and it applies only in the context, admittedly understood in a broad sense, of economic competition. The Act cannot, on the other hand, govern fields unconnected with that, such as political, sporting or scientific competition … or the expression of philosophical, moral or religious convictions. In that sense, the issue [of the existence] of detriment to a competitive relationship may remain relevant…', 'In the instant case it may be doubted whether such a relationship has really been damaged or threatened by the defendant’s campaign against microwave ovens as that campaign is not in any way directed at any particular manufacturer or distributor of such appliances. … The situation is in this respect very different from the one ruled on in the judgment published in RO 117 IV 193, in which a journalist had given erroneous information about the merits of three rival brands of sewing machine. …”', 'Secondly, he held that, “supposing the UCA to be applicable”, Article 28 c § 3 of the Swiss Civil Code did not allow the relevant interim orders to be made. In this connection, he noted the following reason in particular:', '“...', '... the imminent infringement of which the [MHEA] complains is not, prima facie, apt to cause it any damage affecting it personally. On the other hand, some of its members may suffer damage in the form of loss of turnover. ... there is nothing to show that such damage might be very substantial, and it cannot be presumed that it will be.', 'Indeed, no information has been provided on the turnover in respect of microwave ovens achieved by the members of the association, the relation which that turnover bears to the turnover in respect of other appliances, whether there has been any reduction in the sale of microwave ovens since the articles appeared in issue no. 19 of the Journal Franz Weber or any reconversion to purchases of traditional cookers. Prima facie, it seems doubtful that the defendant’s campaign has entailed any large ‑ scale disaffection of the general public. Admittedly, his journal has a large circulation, but it must be read above all by people who have already made up their minds and who in all probability did not envisage buying a microwave oven. As to other members of the public, while they might have heard about Franz Weber’s statements, which have been echoed in the ordinary press, they will also have been aware of the reassuring statements published in particular by the WHO and the OFSP [Federal Office of Public Health] that have also been referred to in the general press. When one sees how ineffective anti-smoking campaigns are, despite being based on undisputed scientific data and being supported by the authorities, it is by no means certain that the defendant’s statements, even if they were to be repeated, could substantially affect the market in microwave ovens for any length of time.', '... In the light, inter alia, of the private expert’s report by Professor Teuber [see paragraph 21 below], the clarification given by the WHO and the OFSP and his own modest knowledge of scientific method, the President takes it as read that the research carried out by Dr Hans Hertel is insufficient to support the categorical conclusions which the defendant thought he could draw from it. The most that can be deduced from that research is that it would be appropriate to carry out a more thorough, rigorously methodical survey on a larger number of people. It is clearly unreasonable to affirm, as was done in issue no. 19 of the Journal Franz Weber that it has been scientifically proved that microwave ovens are harmful and that they must be immediately destroyed and their use banned. It nonetheless remains the case that some scientists still have doubts about the safety of microwave ovens. The fact that they are in a minority does not of itself enable one to exclude the possibility that they might be partly right, as this is an area in which no certainty exists. Indeed, when the OFSP ’s report is read in full it can be seen that there remain a number of unresolved problems.', 'In these circumstances, and even if it seems highly likely that Franz Weber’s statements are wholly unfounded, I cannot find that it is absolutely clear that that is the case. ...', '… Lastly, the interim orders sought would appear disproportionate at all events. They would in fact lead to a kind of judicial censorship of scientific research and the conclusions that may be drawn from it, and this is scarcely compatible with the living traditions in this country, in which it is generally considered that it is for one’s peers and not for the courts to assess the worth and significance of a scientist’s work.”', 'The judge nevertheless took formal note of Mr Weber’s undertaking', '“… not to use in forthcoming publications of his newspaper or in any other publications or at press conferences, public events or presentations to the media images of a skeleton or a cross or tomb in association with the presentation of a microwave oven”.', '18. On 14 April 1992 Mr Weber made the following statement (translated from German):', '“We refer to the summary which appeared in issue no. 19 … of the Journal Franz Weber under the title “Microwave ovens: a health hazard” and certify that Mr Hertel and Mr Blanc cannot be held responsible for either its form or its content, for which sole responsibility lies with the editor. The same applies to the cover page. Furthermore, we should like to point out that the title and sub-title of the research report which followed it were likewise the editor’s responsibility.', 'We must also expressly emphasise that Mr Hertel has never been a member of our newspaper’s editorial staff or paid as such. The fact that Mr Hertel’s name (like Dr Bill Clark’s) appeared in the imprint under the heading Editorial staff instead of under Contributors to this issue was due to a mistake in the editorial office.”', '2. The proceedings against Mr Hertel', '(a) In the Canton of Berne Commercial Court', '19. The MHEA asked Mr Hertel to publish a statement to the effect that he would no longer make unfair comments on microwave ovens. He did not reply.', '20. On 7 August 1992 the association lodged an application under the UCA with the Commercial Court ( Handelsgericht ) of the Canton of Berne, seeking to have Mr Hertel prohibited, on pain of the penalties provided in Article 292 of the Swiss Criminal Code (imprisonment or a fine) and Article 403 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Berne (a fine of up to 5,000 Swiss francs or imprisonment, in serious cases for up to a year), from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens was a danger to health and led to in the blood of those who consumed it changes that indicated a pathological disorder and presented a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process, and from using, in publications and public speeches on microwave ovens, the image of death, whether represented by a hooded skeleton carrying a scythe or by some similar symbol.', '21. As before the President of the Vevey District Court, the plaintiff association produced a private expert’s report by Professor M. Teuber of the Food Research Institute of the Zürich Federal Institute of Technology. The report, dated 6 March 1992, concludes (translated from German):', '“Blanc and Hertel’s experiments on the harmfulness of food heated by microwaves and their interpretations of them were not conducted and described according to scientifically recognised criteria. They are of no scientific value; the conclusions drawn from them as to the alleged harmfulness of food cooked by microwaves have no verifiable basis and are unsustainable.”', '22. In a judgment of 19 March 1993 the Commercial Court allowed the application. It gave the following reasons (translated from German):', '“1. …', 'The amended UCA differs from the former enactment in having substantially wider scope. Its key characteristic is its functional approach, based on guaranteeing fair, undistorted competition. That approach is apparent from the new drafting of the Act’s protective aim in section 1 UCA and has led to a new definition of the offence of unfair competition in the general provision of section 2. The requirement of a competitive relationship, for instance, has been removed from the Act. Its personal scope, as apparent from section 2, does not cover only the acts of competitors, suppliers and customers; third parties not involved in such relations may be (independently) liable if their conduct affects relations in the context of economic competition and if, through their statements, they adversely affect the competitive position of the person targeted (see Troller and Troller, Kurzlehrbuch des Immaterialgüterrechts, p. 189). Competition is particularly affected by consumer-protection organisations, but also, for example, by reviewers, art critics and media personalities. Also caught by the Act are the authors of financial analyses, company reports and – what is of importance here – scientific studies, provided that the essential elements of the offence of unfair competition are present (Ernst Zeller, SZW 1/93, p. 23). In the event of inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily derogatory statements concerning the subject of study, these people will be guilty of unfair competition. The new wording of section 2 UCA has thus put an end to the old controversy as to whether the application of the Act requires the existence of a competitive relationship. Persons unconnected with a sector who interfere in the competition between third parties are likewise caught by the Unfair Competition Act (David, Unlauterer Wettbewerb, p. 169; cf. BGE 117 IV 193: Bernina). In each case, however, it must be ascertained whether the behaviour of the person concerned affects the relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers. The Act is directed at all those whose behaviour or commercial management may have an effect on economic competition. The decisive factor is whether the activity complained of has direct or indirect effects on the competitive position of the person making it or of a third party (Pedrazzini, Unlauterer Wettbewerb, Berne 1992, pp. 32 and 47). Both according to legal writers and in practice, economic relevance in the sense of a potential aptitude to affect competition is taken into account (see H.P. Walter, Das Wettbewerbsverhältnis im neuen UWG, SMI 1992, pp. 169 et seq.). Capability of affecting competition must be determined objectively; it is of no importance whether given behaviour is associated with a subjective intention to affect the market; the decisive factor is whether the action in question is objectively apt to affect competition (Walter, ibid., p. 176; cf. BGE 117 IV, pp. 195 et seq.: Bernina). This was so in the instant case, as was set out above in relation to the question of the plaintiff’s locus standi. Even if there is no certain proof of a connection between the drop in turnover in respect of microwave ovens and the [defendant’s] behaviour, it is clear that the statements and publications complained of in the instant case are apt to diminish sales of microwave ovens and, consequently, to harm the businesses associated with the plaintiff. The objective aptitude to affect competition is therefore established.', '2. Section 2 UCA defines as unfair and illegal ‘any conduct or commercial practice ... if it is deceptive or in any other way offends the principle of good faith and if it affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers’. The general provision of section 2 is given concrete expression by the provisions of sections 3 to 8, which describe the special factual ingredients ( Sondertatbestände ) of the offence. Section 3(a) provides that a person acts unfairly if, in particular, he denigrates others or the goods, work, services, prices or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements. Unfair competition does not necessarily presuppose either bad faith or fault, but merely an objective breach of good faith ( BGE 109 IV 488, 97II 160). A statement is ‘inaccurate’ if it can objectively be seen to be false (Troller and Troller, p. 188). A statement is ‘misleading’ if, while not untrue, it creates a false impression through the use of devious means; as with the risk of confusion in the context of trademark disputes, the yardstick to be used here is that of the usual vigilance and discernment of the customers targeted. A statement may be ‘unnecessarily wounding’ in various ways. Firstly, the manner in which a statement is made may be considered improper if it goes far beyond what would appear reasonable in the light of what had caused the statement to be made. Secondly, even where an accurate factual basis exists, the value judgments expressed may be unlawful if they appear unjustified on the facts. Lastly, a statement may also be wounding if it is inaccurate or is mainly and without good cause intended to harm another. Criticism that is impermissible in form, content or aim is therefore unacceptable… It has already been held in ZR 27/1928 no. 163 … that the description ‘dangerous’ was derogatory in character. Advertising based on fear, using expressions such as ‘take X, otherwise it will be too late’, ‘don’t take any risks’, ‘better too early than too late’, ‘tooth decay is lurking’, or even simply ‘keep your hair’ is also unacceptable…', '…', '… it is certain that it cannot be said that it is scientifically proved that food prepared with a microwave oven constitutes a danger to health and is carcinogenic. To date, there has been no scientific evidence that such a danger exists. The defendant’s assertions are not corroborated either by his own research – which did not meet generally accepted scientific standards – or by that of other, respectable scientists. The opposite would seem to be nearer the truth, as is shown by the observations of the World Health Organisation and the Federal Office of Public Health. In that regard, the fact that Professor Blanc clearly dissociated himself from the conclusions drawn by the defendant from their joint research is likewise significant. The defendant’s statements that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it that indicate a pathological disorder and present a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process are manifestly false and untrue and consequently inaccurate within the meaning of section 3(a) UCA. The application must therefore be allowed. The applicant remains of course free to base his propositions on new scientific findings.', '…', 'There would nonetheless have been a breach of the UCA even if the defendant’s belief had been objectively accurate since, as has already been said, section 3(a) UCA also prohibits misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements. Such statements were made in the present case as will be explained in greater detail under point 4 below.', '3. The Court cannot share the opinion of Professor Peter Nobel, published in SJZ 88, p. 251 and cited by the defendant, that for an unfair act to affect competition within the meaning of section 2 UCA there must be a corresponding intention, that is to say a subjective wish to have an impact on competition. That view is inconsistent with the aim pursued by the UCA, which is to guarantee, in the interests of all the parties concerned, fair, undistorted competition (see section 1 UCA); those concerned are thus competitors, customers and the general public (‘tripartite nature’ of competition law and ‘equivalence’ of the three interested groups, Botschaft, pp. 35 and 50). There is consequently nothing in the Act to support that opinion. An amendment to the Act would be necessary for that (cf. Roger Zäch, ZSR 111 I, 1992, pp. 173 et seq., with reference to the Federal Council’s reply to the motion of a national councillor, Peter Vollmer, concerning a revision of the UCA, NZZ of 15.1.1992). … The principle of good faith mentioned in the general provision of section 2 UCA, which is decisive of the issue of fairness and therefore of legality, must be construed in the light of the Act’s purpose and the special factual ingredients of section 3(a) UCA. These define in greater detail the unlawful conduct, for which no fault is required, constituting the tort of ‘unfair competition’. No competitive relationship between the ‘tortfeasor’ and the ‘victim’ is required under the Act (see above). All that is needed is behaviour apt to affect competition; a very weak link with an economic activity will thus suffice (Pedrazzini, Unlauterer Wettbewerb, p. 33; cf. also BGE 117 IV, pp. 193 et seq.: Bernina); that is a consequence of the functional conception that governed the revision of the Act. The new UCA was intended to enlarge the sphere of protection afforded by the Act. Thus, in the light of the provision setting out the aim pursued by the Act and of the general provision of the Act, the requirement of an intention to affect competition is incompatible with the definition of the tort of unfair competition within the meaning of the general provision of section 2 UCA, as it is not contained in that definition (cf. Zeller, loc. cit., p. 23). Anyone who in his media work seeks to cause a scandal or a sensation is also caught by the Act. Freedom of the press does not relieve those concerned from the obligation to comply with professional ethical standards – on the contrary, it takes such an obligation for granted (Pedrazzini, loc. cit. p. 239, cf. Zeller, loc. cit., p. 25).', 'Even if the Court were to accept Nobel’s opinion, it would not in the instant case be led to a different conclusion. Intention ( Absicht ) is a particular form of knowledge that one is acting wrongly ( Vorsatz ). For such intention to exist, it suffices that the person concerned is aware of the possibility that the act will be carried out and that he accepts that possibility (recklessness; cf. Stark, Ausservertragliches Haftpflichtrecht, Skriptum, notes 448 et seq., pp. 101 et seq.). As a subscriber to the Journal Franz Weber the defendant knew to whom he was sending the research paper for publication. He thus accepted the simplistic and exaggerated interpretation of the published article, and he also endorsed the publication in its entirety since at no stage did he dissociate himself from even part of it in writing but, while not considering it to be 100% accurate, nevertheless approved it with the representation of the Reaper.', '4. Since the scope of the UCA is determined by the mere potential aptitude to affect competition, acts performed in the exercise of fundamental rights in the field of ideas are covered by it, even when they have only a remote link with economic activity; only acts that are no more than ideas fall outside the scope of the statute, provided that they are confined to a strictly personal sphere of activity (Pedrazzini, loc. cit., pp. 33 et seq., Urs Saxer, AJP 1993, p. 606). In that respect, whether or not the activity concerned is remunerated is irrelevant. However, an act will not be caught by the UCA merely because it is performed outside the private sphere. It is necessary that there be a link, however weak, with an economic activity. Acts that are performed for purely disinterested ends are not covered by the UCA. Such would be the case, for example, with associations whose activity is wholly disinterested. An association will be disinterested if it pursues altruistic aims and does not deal in the (economic) market. If it does so deal, even without seeking to make a profit, it will lose the exemption (Pedrazzini, loc. cit. p. 33).', 'The freedom to carry out scientific research, which can be considered a fundamental right (see Jörg Müller, Die Grundrechte des Schweizerischen Bundesverfassung, pp. 122 et seq.) has not been infringed in the instant case. The defendant was and remains entitled to pursue his research. The majority of legal writers consider that scientific freedom includes the freedom to carry out research, to teach and to use the result of research done by others (see Müller, loc. cit.). In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish scientific freedom from the freedom to communicate to others the knowledge gained. Like practically all fundamental rights, this freedom of expression (as an unwritten fundamental right) is not, however, without limits in its application. It is subject to restrictions, especially in the sphere of the mass media, by the legal order, which provides for the protection of reputation in the Criminal Code and for protection of all aspects of the personality, including economic ones, in the Civil Code and the UCA (see Müller, loc. cit., pp. 106 et seq.; BGE 117 IV 193: Bernina). Scientific freedom does not therefore justify publication – especially in non-specialist periodicals (publication in specialist reviews would have to be considered differently) – of provisional results of research that are misleading or devoid of sound scientific basis and do not enable conclusions to be reached with certainty. Scientific researchers must be aware of their responsibilities and give consideration to the issue of what status laymen will give to the expression of their opinion. These constraints apply to the defendant likewise. The mere fact that the application of a statute affects the exercise of a fundamental right by no means signifies that the restriction of that right is unlawful. When it enacted the UCA, the legislature knew perfectly well that there was a risk that the statute would come into conflict with the protected area of intellectual freedoms. That is why section 14 UCA provides, by way of a cross-reference to Articles 28 c and 28 f of the Civil Code, that preventive measures against periodicals may be ordered only in the strictly limited circumstances set out in Article 28 c § 3 of the Civil Code. In the absence of more detailed provision, the assumption must be that no privilege should attach to facts such as those in the instant case. Independently of that issue, it must also be observed that, on the basis of the principle that there is no hierarchy of fundamental rights (see Rohrer, Die Beziehung des Grundrechten untereinander, thesis, Zürich 1982, pp. 104 et seq.), it is necessary to weigh against the fundamental rights relied on by the defendant the right to freedom of trade and industry.', 'An essential feature is how language is used to communicate a scientific opinion when knowledge is still uncertain and, for example, is based solely on sample surveys or experiments involving small numbers of people (only eight in this instance) who do not represent a cross-section of the population. The more clear-cut the reports of opinions, the stricter are the requirements to be made of the linguistically correct representation of the opinions concerned. It is also significant that, even after the event, the defendant did not distance himself from gross simplifications and exaggerations in the article or from the image of the Reaper with a microwave oven, which appears on every page of the research paper.', 'Since the defendant has identified himself with the article in its entirety, the plaintiff’s application must, in terms of competition law, be allowed. Through his assertions, which have been mentioned in detail above, and the use of the image of the Reaper, for which he is liable as he knew the style of the review and accepted and approved that exaggerated representation, the defendant has, irrespective of whether the substance was true, overstepped the acceptable limits and has thus acted ‘ unnecessarily woundingly’ within the meaning of section 3(a) UCA. By combining a tabloid-style report with scientific comment he has also misled the intended readership. In particular, the image of the Reaper and statements such as ‘microwave ovens are more harmful than the Dachau gas chambers’, ‘… you are exposing yourself to a slow death…’, or ‘… it is certain that you will die from cancer…’ … amount to unacceptable playing on the fear of death. The defendant himself had to admit that the journalist from the Journal Franz Weber had gone a bit too far and that his article was a little tendentious. He said that he had not liked that very much as a scientist, but the reporter had nonetheless been right. It was sometimes necessary to use a journalistic style to wake people up...', '…', '5. Among other forms of protection, the civil law affords the possibility of applying for an injunction ( Unterlassungsklage ). The purpose of such an application is to obtain from the court an order prohibiting the defendant from interfering in the plaintiff’s sphere of interest. Such an order may concern existing or continuing interference and threatened interference. The court may allow such an application irrespective of whether damage has been caused (Troller and Troller, p. 105, BGE 104 II 134). Applications may be lodged and injunctions issued only in respect of precisely defined acts which the defendant has committed and is likely to continue to commit or is about to commit ( BGE 93 II 51). That is clearly true in the instant case, especially as the defendant has expressly stated that he will continue to follow that route scientifically … and has not distanced himself from the publications in issue. To the application for an injunction there may be joined an application for an order that, if he breaches the injunction, the defendant shall be punished with imprisonment under Article 292 of the Criminal Code or a fine ( BGE 79 II 420). That penalty must be supplemented by the one provided for in Article 403 of the Code of Civil Procedure.', '…”', '(b) In the Federal Court', '23. On an application by the applicant, the Federal Court (First Civil Division) delivered the following judgment on 25 February 1994 (translation from German):', '“…', '3. The appellant submitted that the UCA was not applicable in the instant case since the statements complained of were made disinterestedly with a view to protecting public health and not in a context of competition.', '(a) The UCA is intended to guarantee, in the interests of all the parties concerned, fair, undistorted competition (section 1). Consequently, any conduct or commercial practice is unfair if it offends the principle of good faith and affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers (section 2 UCA) or is apt to affect them (Cherpillod, ‘ L’application de la loi contre la concurrence déloyale aux journalistes ’, résumé of a lecture of 28 January 1992, given to the Swiss Copyright and Media Association, p. 7). When the UCA is applied with a view to preventing distortions in competition in the private sector, however, the conduct of persons who are not in competition with the supplier or customer affected may also be classified as unfair. That is indisputably the position according to current legal theory and the case-law ( BGE 117 IV 193 E. 1, pp. 195 et seq. and references, 116 II 463 E. 4a, p. 470; Nobel, Zu den Schranken des UWG für die Presse, in SJZ 88/1992, pp. 245 et seq.; Schluep, Die Europaverträglichkeit des schweizerischen Lauterkeitsrechts, in Un droit européen de la concurrence déloyale en formation, pp. 67 et seq. and p. 81). Notwithstanding that no competitive relationship is required, only conduct that can be described as an act of competition is prohibited, that is to say acts which are objectively aimed at affecting competitive relationships and not those which take place in a wholly different context. For the purposes of the UCA the conduct of the tortfeasor must therefore be related to the market or competition (‘ marktrelevant, marktgeneigt oder wettbewerbsgerichtet ’ – Schluep, loc.cit.). Competition can only exist where the action of the person concerned has, or is apt to have, an effect outside the private sphere (Pedrazzini, Unlauterer Wettbewerb, p. 33). Consequently, the only acts that are competition-related are those which increase or reduce the market share or the rate of success in finding customers of businesses formed with a view to profit or which objectively pursue those aims (see David, Schweizerisches Wettbewerbsrecht, 2nd ed., 1988, p. 29). The decisive factor, as the court below rightly pointed out, is economic relevance in the sense of a potential aptitude to affect competition; for that purpose, an objective aptitude is sufficient and it is of no importance whether there was a subjective intention of intervening in the economic sphere. That being so, it is of no help to the appellant to rely on the academic legal theory that, although the need for a competitive relationship has been dispensed with, an act committed with the intention of affecting competition is required in all cases for there to be an infringement of the UCA (Nobel, loc. cit., passim ). Quite apart from the fact that that theory entails the risk of confusion between the concept of illegality and elements of the notion of fault, the appellant is confusing motive and intention. He does not deny that he is seeking to protect consumers by influencing their behaviour in the market and thereby affecting the sales market for the product he criticises. That clearly shows a competitive intention, even if it is prompted by idealistic motives and not by the pursuit of gain.', '(b) Scientific research and publications are not in themselves directed at competition if they remain within the academic context (David, loc. cit.). They so become, however, if the target readership may objectively construe the scientific opinions as being designed to influence the behaviour of market players and, in particular, of customers. It is unnecessary to explain this in greater detail where science is used as a disguised means of advertising and where scientific knowledge may serve to boost a product’s sales (Baumbach and Hefermehl, Wettbewerbsrecht, 17th ed., 1993...). The same must apply, however, where allegedly scientific statements are used in a competitive context to influence negatively the sales of a particular product through denigration of it. Such statements likewise amount to acts of competition covered by the UCA and are subject to its requirement of fairness (Baumbach and Hefermehl, loc. cit.).', 'The statements held against the applicant are, in both content and presentation, regard being had in particular to the readership of the periodical concerned, clearly intended to influence the market since, at least objectively, they are unmistakably aimed at deterring consumers from buying and using microwave ovens. They are thus apt to affect competition. That is why the Commercial Court rightly considered that they came within the scope of the UCA and therefore examined whether they should be described as unfair within the meaning of that Act.', '4. (a) The appellant considers that the order prohibiting his using symbols evoking death is contrary to federal law as it was not he who was responsible for the use of the image of the Reaper in the Journal Franz Weber in respect of which the injunction was imposed and so no recurrence is likely. The Commercial Court emphasised that it remained unproved that the appellant had taken part in the design and editing of the periodical or that his approval had been sought before the article in question appeared. The appellant had, however, become aware of the tenor of the article because he was a subscriber to the review but had not distanced himself from it in any way and had even said, at the trial, that he liked the image of the Reaper. The court concluded that the appellant had knowingly accepted his research paper being used in a simplified and exaggerated manner and had approved the publication in its entirety.', '…', '5. The Berne Court prohibited the appellant ‘from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it that indicate a pathological disorder and present a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process’. The appellant says that that prohibition is contrary to federal law since the prohibited statement is not unfair within the meaning of the UCA and enjoyed the protection afforded to fundamental rights.', '…', '(b) As already indicated, given the readership to which his statements were addressed and the scientifically unsophisticated content of those statements, the appellant has left the purely academic sphere and entered the realm of competition. He is therefore subject to the fairness requirement laid down by the UCA.', 'Section 3(a) UCA provides that a person acts unfairly if he denigrates others or the goods, work, services, prices or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements. In the appellant’s defence, it must admittedly be acknowledged that it is not always easy to establish the degree of scientific truth of an assertion, since in this sphere of knowledge, what is held to be true today will often be superseded tomorrow and true again the day after (Baumbach and Hefermehl, loc. cit., ...). That does not, however, mean to say that ostensibly scientific views on one’s own work or the work of others in the competition field must always unconditionally be considered fair. When an opinion relating to the market refers to a question that is professionally controversial and is presented as being objectively accurate or scientifically confirmed, that means that the party concerned has opted in favour of a particular opinion and is ready to answer for its accuracy also in the context of competition ( BGH, 23.10.1971, in GRUR 1971, pp. 153 et seq., E. IV/2, p. 155). Positive or negative advertising containing scientific data must, accordingly, in the public interest and in order to ensure effective competition, only be accepted if the data reflect established scientific knowledge or at least if the advertising clearly states that there are differing opinions. If there is no absolute guarantee that the scientific data are correct, the uncritical publication of them is at least deceptive and is accordingly misleading within the meaning of section 3(a) UCA (Baumbach and Hefermehl, loc. cit., ...). That was so in the instant case. According to the Commercial Court there is absolutely no scientific confirmation of the applicant’s argument; on the contrary, it has been mostly rejected. To hold it out as accurate in the context of competition is unacceptable under section 3(a) UCA, and accordingly the injunction issued by the Commercial Court does not infringe any provision of federal law.', '(c) There can be no question of the UCA’s having been applied in breach of the Federal Constitution or the European Convention. Statutes must, in particular, define fundamental rights and other, conflicting duties of the State so that these two concerns of constitutional law may be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent (Müller, Elemente einer schweizerischen Grundrechtstheorie, p. 104). This notion of regulation and the values underlying it must also be taken into account in the drafting of statutes. The smooth operation of competition and economic freedom, freedom of expression, scientific freedom and freedom of the press must be guaranteed as well as possible, but at the same time limited so that the various constitutional objectives may be reconciled in practice. In that regard, it should be noted that the UCA provides a remedy only in respect of unfair statements, and the meaning and purpose of freedom of expression or freedom of the press cannot be to legitimise unlawful public assertions of that kind. (Hotz, Zur Bedeutung des Bundesgesetzes gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb (UWG) für die Massenmedien, in SJZ 86/1990, pp. 26 et seq.). Anyone claiming scientific freedom is therefore wholly free to expound his knowledge in the academic sphere but, where competition is concerned, he may not claim to have the truth on his side where the opinion he is putting forward is disputed. An opinion which has not been confirmed scientifically must in particular not be misused as a disguised form of positive or negative advertising of one’s own work or the work of others. In the present case, that is all the more true as the Commercial Court expressly left the applicant free to base his proposition on new scientific findings.', '6. The appeal must therefore be dismissed…”']","['II. Relevant domestic law', '24. Section 1 of the Federal Unfair Competition Act of 30 September 1943 reads as follows:', '“1. Any abuse of economic competition resulting from deception or any other conduct contrary to the principle of good faith shall be deemed to be an act of unfair competition within the meaning of this Act.', '2. The principle of good faith is not complied with where, for example, a person', '(a) denigrates others or the goods, work, activity or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements;', '…”', '25. The Act of 30 September 1943 was repealed by the Federal Unfair Competition Act of 19 December 1986, the relevant provisions of which are as follow:', 'Section 1', '“This Act is intended to guarantee, in the interests of all the parties concerned, fair, undistorted competition.”', 'Section 2', '“Any conduct [ Verhalten ] or commercial practice [ Geschäftsgebaren ] shall be unfair and illegal if it is deceptive or in any other way offends the principle of good faith and if it affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers.”', 'Section 3', '“A person acts unfairly if, in particular,', '(a) he denigrates others or the goods, work, services, prices or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements;', '…”', 'Section 9', '“1.

Mr Hertel applied to the Commission on 13 September 1994. He alleged a violation of Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention.', '27. The Commission (Second Chamber) declared the application (no. 25181/94) admissible on 27 November 1996. In its report of 9 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a breach of Article 10 (ten votes to five) and that no separate issue arose under Article 6 § 1 or Article 8 of the Convention (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '28. In his memorial the applicant said th at he stood by the terms of his application and observations to the Commission.', '29. The Government invited the Court to', '“hold that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case and that no separate issue arose under Article 8 or Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.”', 'as TO THE LAW', 'i. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '30. The applicant submitted that the ban imposed on him by the Swiss courts under the Federal Unfair Competition Act of 19 December 1986 had infringed Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Government contested that submission; the Commission agreed with it.', '31. The Court observes that Mr Hertel is prohibited, on pain of the penalties provided in Article 292 of the Criminal Code and Article 403 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it that indicate a pathological disorder and present a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process, and from using, in publications and public speeches on microwave ovens, the image of death (see paragraphs 20, 22 and 23 above). It is clear therefore that the applicant has suffered an “interference by public authority” in the exercise of the right guaranteed by Article 10; indeed, that was not disputed.', 'Such an interference will infringe the Convention if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10. It is therefore necessary to determine whether it was “prescribed by law”, motivated by one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve them.', 'A. “Prescribed by law”', '32. The applicant disputed that the interference in issue was “prescribed by law”. In his submission, as he was not in the household electrical appliances market he could not reasonably have foreseen that by sending his research paper to the Journal Franz Weber he might be committing unfair competition within the meaning of the Act of 19 December 1986. Indeed, the scope of that Act was a matter of debate.', '33. The Government replied that the prohibition on the applicant was based on sections 2, 3 and 9 of the Act of 19 December 1986 and on the Federal Court’s interpretation of those provisions. It was clear therefrom that even a person who was not a “competitor of the suppliers or buyers” of such goods could act “unfairly” within the meaning of that statute if he committed an “act of competition”, that is one likely to affect the market; whether or not there was a “subjective intention” to do so was irrelevant. As the dissemination of the statements in issue was liable to have an “objective impact” on the market in microwave ovens, Mr Hertel could not maintain that it had been unforeseeable that an injunction would be imposed on him under section 9.', '34. The Commission came to the same conclusion.', '35. The Court reiterates that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Again, whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49).', '36. In the instant case section 2 of the Federal Unfair Competition Act of 19 December 1986 (“UCA”) contains a general provision in which are defined as “unfair and illegal” not only any commercial practice but also any conduct that is “deceptive or in any other way offends the principle of good faith and ... affects relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers”. Furthermore, section 3, which lists certain unfair acts, provides in particular that “a person acts unfairly if ... he denigrates others or the goods, work, services, prices or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements” (see paragraph 25 above).', 'The UCA is not therefore confined in scope solely to economic agents: people, such as Mr Hertel, who are not market players are also concerned. Any remaining doubts as to the express intention of the legislature in that regard will be dispelled by reading the Federal Council’s memorandum in support of the bill (memorandum of 18 May 1983, FF 1983 II 1037), from which it is clear that the bill’s sponsors intended, like the legislature in 1943, to protect competition as an “institution”, and not just “competitors”. Moreover, it is explained in the memorandum (chapter 241.2, commentary on section 2 of the bill) that:', '“…', 'Breaches of good faith standards occur in the context of conduct or commercial practices that affect relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers. ... The concept of conduct, which must be understood in terms of its effect on competitive relationships, enables the acts of third parties which have an important effect on competition but are not directly associated with it, whether on behalf of competitors or on behalf of customers, to be covered also. The categories of persons playing a significant role in competition will thus be extended. It is perfectly possible for consumers’ associations also unfairly to affect competition by publishing comparative tests or referring to press articles, or radio or television programmes. The consequence of enlarging the scope of protection afforded by the UCA to a wider sector means that the members of that wider sector will have to assume their responsibilities and may be called upon to answer if they unfairly affect competition. Indeed the intention to enlarge the categories of people covered by the UCA is not a new one. It was said in the 1942 memorandum on the UCA ( FF 1942 685) that unfair competition was not solely the province of competitors, as the Act also applied when third parties or associations intervened in the field of competition on behalf of certain businesses... That conception is explained in some of the constitutive parts of the UCA in which express reference is made to third parties... The new wording of this section makes it very clear and definitively so that the categories of people who may be found liable for acts of unfair competition are henceforth much wider. It is therefore unnecessary for third parties to be mentioned expressly with respect to conduct that does not involve a competitive position. Likewise, the long-standing debate as to the need for a competitive relationship if the UCA is to apply will thus become devoid of purpose. Legal writers have noted for some time that the requirement of a competitive relationship has led to inappropriate restrictions...', '...”', 'The memorandum goes on to say (Chapter 241.31, commentary on section 3(a) of the bill):', '“… the very wide wording of the general clause ... takes account of the fact that third parties may also unfairly affect or distort competitive relations. In practical terms, this means that people, organisations or associations who are not themselves competitors may be liable for their denigratory statements. The decisive issue is whether the inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements hinder in an unacceptable manner competitive relations or the commercial position of the person or body against whom they are made.”', '37. Furthermore, the Federal Court had already indicated before the occurrence of the events that gave rise to the present case that the applicability of the Act of 19 December 1986 was not conditional on the tortfeasor and the injured party being “competitors”; it had held that a journalist may, through his own articles or by reproducing articles written by others, be guilty of contravening some of the provisions of the Act (see judgment of 18 March 1991, Arrêts du Tribunal fédéral suisse ( ATF ) 117 IV 193).', '38. The Court consequently accepts that it was “foreseeable” that the communication to the Journal Franz Weber of the research paper and its subsequent publication were liable to amount to an act of “competition” within the meaning of the UCA. That being so, in order to conclude that the interference was “prescribed by law”, the Court need only note that section 3 UCA provides “a person acts unfairly if, in particular, ... he denigrates others or the goods, work, services, prices or business of others by making inaccurate, misleading or unnecessarily wounding statements” and that section 9 provides “Anyone who through an act of unfair competition sustains or is threatened with damage to his goodwill, credit, professional reputation, business or economic interests in general, may apply to a court ... to prohibit the act if it is imminent” (see paragraph 25 above).', 'B. Legitimate aim', '39. The applicant submitted that the aim pursued in the instant case – guaranteeing “fair” competition and therefore the protection of mere commercial interests – was not among those exhaustively set out in paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '40. The Government argued that the prohibition imposed on the applicant was intended to protect consumers and suppliers from the dissemination of misleading and false information about the characteristics of services and goods on offer on the market. It was thus aimed not only at the protection of the “rights of others” but also the “prevention of [economic] disorder”.', '41. The Commission expressed the view that the interference in question was aimed at “the protection of the reputation [and] rights of others”.', '42. The Court observes that the Federal Unfair Competition Act of 19 December 1986 “is intended to guarantee, in the interests of all the parties concerned, fair, undistorted competition” (section 1 – see paragraph 25 above) and that a person who sustains or is “threatened with damage to his goodwill, credit, professional reputation, business or', 'economic interests in general” through an “act of unfair competition” may apply to a court for an order prohibiting such act (section 9, ibid.). It was under those provisions that the domestic courts granted the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Suppliers of Household Electrical Appliances’ application alleging unfair competition on the part of Mr Hertel likely to be prejudicial to the interests of its members. There is no doubt, therefore, that the aim of the measure was the “protection of the … rights of others”.', 'C. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '43. Mr Hertel considered that the measure imposed on him had been disproportionate. It amounted to inordinate protection of the economic interests of the members of the complainant association, at the cost of his research papers being censored and his being prevented from taking part in scientific debate on the public-health issues raised by the use of microwave ovens.', '44. The Government submitted that the interference in the applicant’s freedom of expression was aimed at guaranteeing fair and free competition in the interests of society as a whole. It had therefore met a pressing social need.', 'The Swiss courts had issued the injunction only after carefully weighing up the opposing interests: on the one hand, the interest of the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Suppliers of Household Electrical Appliances (“MHEA”) and consumers in being protected against the propagation of false allegations about microwave ovens and, on the other hand, the applicant’s interest in disseminating information of his choice. The applicant had been held out in the article in issue as an “expert”; the article had, moreover, been accompanied by the shocking image of death and had stated that it had been scientifically proved that the use of microwave ovens was dangerous for human health. In view of the fact that the Journal Franz Weber was intended for lay readers, not specialists, and had a circulation of more than one hundred thousand copies, a large section of the public would thus have been convinced that there was certainty on the issue. However, not only was the question highly controversial, but in addition the research carried out by the applicant had lacked the rigour necessary to be described as “scientific”. Those circumstances justified the interference which, moreover, had been limited, as Mr Hertel had remained free not only to pursue his research into microwaves but also to publish and disseminate the results in non-economic spheres such as scientific or academic circles. It was also necessary to take into account the shocking statements the applicant had made in 1989, which had been reproduced in issue no. 8 of the Journal Franz Weber, that microwave ovens were “worse than the Dachau gas chambers”.', 'Lastly, in view of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the Contracting States in respect of unfair competition, Article 10 had not been infringed.', '45. The Commission came to the opposite conclusion.', '46. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles under its case-law, as most recently set out in the judgments of Zana v. Turkey (25 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII, pp. 2547–48, § 51) and Grigoriades v. Greece ( Reports 1997-VII, p. 2589, § 44):', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which – as the Court has already said above – must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see the following judgments: Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49; Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 41; and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 37).', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, p. 29, § 50). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the Jersild judgment cited above, p. 26, § 31).', '47. The Swiss authorities thus had some margin of appreciation to decide whether there was a “pressing social need” to impose the injunction in question on the applicant.', 'Such a margin of appreciation is particularly essential in commercial matters, especially in an area as complex and fluctuating as that of unfair competition (see the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, p. 20, § 33, and the Jacubowski v. Germany judgment of 23 June 1994, Series A no. 291-A, p. 14, § 26). It is however necessary to reduce the extent of the margin of appreciation when what is at stake is not a given individual’s purely “commercial” statements, but his participation in a debate affecting the general interest, for example, over public health; in the instant case, it cannot be denied that such a debate existed. It concerned the effects of microwaves on human health (indeed, the only issue was over the conclusions reached by Mr Hertel in his research as set out in issue no. 19 of the Journal Franz Weber and not the subject matter of that research). In that respect, the present case is substantially different from the markt intern and Jacubowski cases cited above.', 'The Court will consequently carefully examine whether the measures in issue were proportionate to the aim pursued. In that regard, it must balance the need to protect the rights of the members of the MHEA against Mr Hertel’s freedom of expression.', '48. The Court observes that the applicant did no more than send a copy of his research paper to the Journal Franz Weber. He had nothing to do with the editing of issue no. 19 of that periodical or in the choice of its illustration, of which he became aware only after its publication. That is clear from Mr Weber’s statement of 14 April 1992 (see paragraph 18 above) and was not called into question by either the Commercial Court of the Canton of Berne or by the Federal Court. Both courts held that the applicant’s liability derived from the fact that in sending his paper to the Journal Franz Weber he had accepted its being used in a simplified and exaggerated manner – as, given the periodical concerned, it had been foreseeable that it would be – and that, consequently, he had identified himself with the article in issue (see paragraphs 22–23 above).', 'As regards the content of issue no. 19 relating to microwave ovens, the applicant was thus neither author nor co-author of the title on the cover page (see paragraph 10 above), the editorial column (attributed to Franz Weber – see paragraph 11 above) or of pages 3 to 10 (attributed to René d’Ombresson – see paragraph 12 above). The only parts that can be attributed to him are, with the exception of the titles and sub-titles appearing on them, pages 5 to 10, which contain an extract of the research paper (see paragraph 13 above). The Court notes that nowhere is it expressly proposed that microwave ovens be destroyed or boycotted or their use banned and that the applicant did not repeat the statements he made in 1989 and which had been published in issue no. 8 (April/May/June 1989) of the Journal Franz Weber. In addition and above all, the applicant’s views on the harmful effects on human health of the consumption of food prepared in microwave ovens are expressed in far less categorical terms than the Government intimated; that is to be seen in particular from the repeated use of the conditional mood and the choice of non-affirmative expressions. In that regard, the last lines from the extract, in which the applicant’s conclusions from his experiments are summarised, are particularly striking. Thus, although it is stated that the results obtained “show changes which bear witness to pathogenic disorders”, as regards any cancerous effects it is explained that the results present a pattern which “might” correspond to the beginning of a cancerous development and which “deserves attention”; likewise, there is no assertion that the consumption of irradiated food is harmful for man as a result of the induction of indirect radiation through food, but merely a suggestion that it “might” be (see paragraph 13 above).', '49. It nevertheless remains the case that the dissemination of such statements was likely to have an adverse effect on the sale of microwave ovens in Switzerland and it is to be noted in that respect that the Journal Franz Weber has a not negligible circulation of more or less one hundred and twenty thousand copies. It must nevertheless be noted that the periodical is not general in content since it deals in particular with environmental and public-health issues and is distributed almost entirely by subscription; it therefore has, in all likelihood, a specific readership such that the impact of the ideas it contains should be limited. Indeed, that was the view of the President of the Vevey District Court (see paragraph 17 above). The Court also notes that in the present case it was not alleged that the publication in issue had a measurable effect on the sale of microwave ovens or caused actual damage to the members of the MHEA. In applying the UCA, the Commercial Court of the Canton of Berne and the Federal Court merely found that it was plausible that there had been such an effect. The Commercial Court in particular confined itself to holding (see paragraph 22 above):', '“… In each case … it must be ascertained whether the behaviour of the person concerned affects the relations between competitors or between suppliers and customers… Even if there is no certain proof of a connection between the drop in turnover in respect of microwave ovens and the [defendant’s] behaviour, it is clear that the statements and publications complained of in the instant case are apt to diminish sales of microwave ovens and, consequently, to harm the businesses associated with the plaintiff. The objective aptitude to affect competition is therefore established.”', '50. It will be seen from the foregoing that Mr Hertel played no part in the choice of the illustration for issue no. 19 of the Journal Franz Weber, that those statements that were definitely attributable to him were on the whole qualified and that there is nothing to suggest that they', 'had any substantial impact on the interests of the members of the MHEA. In spite of all that, the Swiss courts prohibited the applicant from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens was a danger to health and led to changes in the blood of those consuming it that indicated a pathological disorder and presented a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process, and from using the image of death in association with microwave ovens.', 'The Court cannot help but note a disparity between that measure and the behaviour it was intended to rectify. That disparity creates an impression of imbalance that is materialised by the scope of the injunction in question. In that regard, although it is true that the injunction applies only to specific statements, it nonetheless remains the case that those statements related to the very substance of the applicant’s views. The effect of the injunction was thus partly to censor the applicant’s work and substantially to reduce his ability to put forward in public views which have their place in a public debate whose existence cannot be denied. It matters little that his opinion is a minority one and may appear to be devoid of merit since, in a sphere in which it is unlikely that any certainty exists, it would be particularly unreasonable to restrict freedom of expression only to generally accepted ideas.', 'The fact that the Swiss courts expressly reserved Mr Hertel’s freedom to pursue his research does not in any way alter that finding. As to presenting the results outside the “economic sphere”, it is not transparently obvious from the courts’ decisions that he was given such a possibility; it may be that the wide scope of the UCA would prevent those reservations being seen as providing a significant reduction in the extent of the interference in question.', 'Furthermore, if the applicant fails to comply with the injunction he runs the risk of a penalty, which could include imprisonment.', '51. In the light of the foregoing, the measure in issue cannot be considered as “necessary” “in a democratic society”. Consequently, there has been a violation of Article 10.', 'alleged violations of article 6 § 1 and article 8 of the convention', '52. The applicant submitted that the measure imposed on him prevented him from communicating to others the result of his scientific work and damaged his “personality as a scientist”; he argued that that amounted to a violation of Article 8. He added that by ordering him not to associate symbols of death with microwave ovens, the Swiss courts had prohibited an act which he had not committed – since he had merely communicated his report to the Journal Franz Weber – and had no intention of committing; he complained on that basis that the measure was “unfair” and amounted to a breach of Article 6 § 1.', '53. The Government maintained that no question arose under Article 8 and that the complaint under Article 6 § 1 was unfounded.', '54. Having regard to its finding of a violation of Article 10, the Court, like the Commission, considers that no separate question arises under Article 6 § 1 or Article 8.', 'application of article 50 of the convention', '55. Article 50 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'Damage', '56. Mr Hertel said that the injunction that had been imposed on him had entailed the closing of his laboratory and caused him damage which he put at 20,000 Swiss francs (CHF).', '57. The Government invited the Court not to allow that claim.', '58. The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view.', '59. The Court finds no causal link between the damage alleged by the applicant and the interference with his right to freedom of expression. It therefore dismisses the claim.', 'Costs and expenses', '60. The applicant claims CHF 72,917 for costs and expenses before the Swiss courts and the Strasbourg institutions (of which CHF 7,980 is claimed for the latter proceedings).', '61. The Government submitted that as regards the applicant’s costs and expenses before the Swiss courts, only those relating to the application to the Federal Court – amounting to CHF 13,000 – should be reimbursed as that had been the only recourse sought on a national level for a decision that there had been a violation as alleged and to remedy it. As to the costs of the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions, a fair assessment would be CHF 8,000. In short, the Government declared that it was ready to pay the applicant CHF 21,000.', '62. The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view.', '63. If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention, it may award the applicant not only the costs and expenses incurred before the Strasbourg institutions, but also those incurred before the national courts for the prevention or redress of the violation (see, in particular, the Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 14, § 36). In the instant case, having regard to the subject matter of the proceedings before the Commercial Court of the Canton of Berne and what was at stake in them, Mr Hertel is entitled to request payment of the costs and expenses incurred in them in addition to the costs and expenses of the proceedings before the Federal Court, the Commission and the Court. That being so, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant CHF 40,000.', 'Default interest', '64. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Switzerland at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 5% per annum.']",2,ch,001-59366,1

Mr Mobin Ahmed, Mr Dennis Perrin, Mr Ray Bentley and Mr David Brough are all British citizens, born in 1941, 1948, 1947 and 1932 respectively. They live in London, Yelverton, Edgware and Exeter respectively. At the relevant time they were each permanently employed in different capacities by various local authorities. Their precise status and functions are described in Section C below.', 'The background to their complaints to the Convention institutions is constituted by the enactment and implementation of legislative measures designed to limit the involvement of certain categories of local government officials, such as themselves, in political activities. The history of the enactment of the relevant measures as well as their purport and scope are described in Section B below. The impact of the measures on the applicants, all persons considered holders of politically restricted posts within the meaning of the applicable legislation, is described in Section C below.', 'B. The adoption of the Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990', '1. The political background to the adoption of the Regulations', '8. Against the background of the increasing politicisation of local government and attendant problems in respect of the relationship between elected members and local government officers, the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Scotland and for Wales, appointed on 5 February 1985 a committee (“the Widdicombe Committee”) to inquire, inter alia, into the respective roles of elected members and officers of local government authorities and to make any necessary recommendations for strengthening the democratic process.', '9. On 9 May 1986, after receiving evidence from 138 local government authorities and over 500 other organisations and individuals, the Widdicombe Committee submitted its report. The Committee firmly endorsed the continuation of the tradition of politically impartial local government officers having regard in particular to the roles of senior officers as managers, advisers and arbitrators in the day-to-day functioning of local government. In his foreword to the final report the Chairman of the Committee wrote:', '“6. Although most of the problems we have perceived have been ones of uncertain relations, there have been some cases, albeit a few, where power has been abused .”', 'In the Chairman’s view, the recent sharpening of the political intensity of local politics was reflected in the relations between elected council members and local government officers and that the trend towards greater politicisation might be a source of future problems unless recommendations were made in order to provide a framework able to cope with it. With regard to the importance of the impartiality of local government officers, the Widdicombe Committee concluded that:', '“6.141. The overwhelming view in the evidence we have received has been that officers (subject to very limited and closely defined exceptions) should continue to serve the council as a whole. … There has been equally wide agreement that the public service tradition of a permanent corps of politically impartial officers should be retained. …', '6.180. Public service in the United Kingdom is founded on a tradition of a permanent corps of politically neutral officers serving with equal commitment whatever party may be in political control. …', '6.182. Local government in the United Kingdom has traditionally been based on the same public service tradition as central government, but this has been a matter of convention and practice. …', '6.186. The issue of principle is therefore straightforward. There must continue to be a system of permanent and politically neutral officers appointed on the basis of merit. The issue which we need to consider is whether new machinery or rules are required to ensure this, and if so on what basis.”', '10. To ensure that senior officers continued to discharge their functions in a manner which was impartial from both a subjective and an objective point of view, the Widdicombe Committee in paragraph 6.217 of its report recommended that:', '“(a) the legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors or who are standing for election as councillors, or who have been councillors within the last year, may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above;', '(b) the Local Authorities’ Conditions of Service Advisory Board should take steps to include in the terms and conditions of officers at the rank of principal officer and above a prohibition on political activity, including:', '(i) standing for, and holding, public elected office;', '(ii) holding office in a political party;', '(iii) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate; and', '(iv) canvassing at elections;', '(c) if the changes recommended at (b) are not made to officers’ terms and conditions, legislation should be introduced to similar effect.”', '2. The adoption of the Regulations', '11. Following the publication of the recommendations of the Widdicombe Committee, on 16 November 1989 the House of Commons passed the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (“the Act”), which empowered the Secretary of State for the Environment to make regulations to restrict the political activities of certain categories of local government officers. The Act entered into force on 29 November 1989.', '12. The Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990 (“the Regulations”) were made under section 1(5) of the Act on 4 April 1990. They were laid before Parliament the following day and came into force on 1 May 1990. The Regulations applied to all persons holding a politically restricted post as defined in section 2(1) of the Act. This term covers three broad categories of local government officials: the most senior post-holders in local government (category one); officials remunerated in excess of a prescribed level and whose posts are listed for the purposes of the application of the Regulations (category two); and officials paid less than the prescribed level but who hold a listed post (category three). Each local authority was obliged to draw up a list of posts falling within the second and third categories (section 2(2)). A local government officer in the second and third categories could apply to an independent adjudicator to have his or her post removed from the list of posts to which the Regulations applied (section 3).', 'All local government officials employed in these categories at the time of the entry into force of the Regulations were deemed, according to regulation 3(1), to be subject to the measures.', 'A more detailed analysis of the contents of the Act and the Regulations is set out at paragraphs 26–33 below.', 'C. The effect of the Regulations on the applicants', '1. Mr Ahmed', '13. The first applicant, Mr Ahmed, was a solicitor employed by the London Borough of Hackney. Although his salary fell below the level prescribed in section 2(2)(a) of the Act (see paragraphs 12 above and especially 30 below), making him a category three officer, the Council pursuant to section 2(2)(c) of the Act included his post in the list of politically restricted posts because, in its opinion, his post involved giving advice on a regular basis to committees of the Council, namely the Housing Benefits Review Board, the Housing Development Sub-Committee and the Environmental Sub-Committee (see paragraph 30 below).', '14. Mr Ahmed was adopted as Labour candidate for election to the London Borough of Enfield in 1990, but was obliged to withdraw his candidature as a result of the Regulations. On 7 March 1990 he applied for removal of his job description from the list of politically restricted posts (see paragraphs 12 above and especially 32 below). The Council confirmed that Mr Ahmed had not attended committees during the previous twelve months, but stated that he would be involved in giving advice to committees in future, and would attend on a more regular basis. The Council did not provide therefore a certificate stating that he did not give advice regularly. The adjudicator replied to the Council on 30 March 1990 that Mr Ahmed’s application for exemption could not therefore be granted.', '2. Mr Perrin', '15. Prior to his retirement, the second applicant, Mr Perrin, was Principal Valuer with the Devon County Council (a category three officer). He was responsible for leading, directing and developing the Council’s area valuation staff. His post required him to give regular advice to the Council’s committees, including strategy advice on key estate management issues, and to speak to the media. Accordingly his post was included in the list of politically restricted posts kept by the Council in accordance with section 2(2) of the Act (see paragraph 12 above and especially paragraph 31 below).', '16. On 19 February 1990 Mr Perrin applied for exemption from political restrictions on the ground that although he advised the Council at meetings and spoke to the media, the advice was “factual valuation information regarding the acquisition, disposal and management of property”. His application for exemption was refused on 20 March 1990. The adjudicator wrote:', '“I am satisfied that the duties of your post do fall within section 2(3) of the Act in that you do regularly attend committee meetings of the authority to give advice. Your authority do state that this advice does not extend to ‘policy advice’, but the Act itself makes no distinction between types of advice. I am not prepared, therefore, to grant an exemption under section 3(4) of the Act.”', '17. As a result of the Regulations, Mr Perrin had to give up his position as Vice-Chair and Property Officer of the Exeter Constituency Labour Party, and had to refrain from supporting and assisting Labour candidates in Exeter City Council elections, including his wife, who was a candidate in May 1990 and May 1991. He also reduced his involvement in trade union activities.', '3. Mr Bentley', '18. The third applicant, Mr Bentley, is a planning manager with Plymouth City Council. He resigned from his position as Chairman of Torridge and West Devon Constituency Labour Party because of the Regulations, and was also restricted in canvassing for his wife who stood as the only Labour Councillor for the West Devon Borough Council, and in giving radio interviews in his capacity as Chairman of the Plymouth Health Emergency, a body concerned with National Health policies.', '19. The monitoring officer of the Council classified Mr Bentley’s post as one that was politically sensitive (a category one post) and appropriately subject to political restrictions under section 2(3) of the Act (see paragraph 30 below). The reasons for the classification included that Mr Bentley was head of the Council’s corporate policy unit, that he was responsible directly to the head of the Council’s paid service, that his post was responsible for policy analysis and research, that he represented the Council on a transport steering group involving other authorities and organisations, and that, in the twelve months prior to 31 August 1990, he attended three meetings of the Council’s Policy and Resources (Finance sub-) Committee and advised on four separate issues of public transport. The monitoring officer considered that Mr Bentley’s post also fell within section 2(7)(a) and (b) of the Act, and was therefore politically restricted in any event (see paragraph 28 below).', '20. Mr Bentley applied for exemption from political restrictions. On 19 November 1990 the adjudicator underlined that he regarded his duties as limited to considering applications concerning restrictions under section 2(2) of the Act. He stated that although the Council may have identified the post as being politically restricted, it was not', '“politically restricted because of that fact, but because it is explicitly covered by section 2(1)(c) of the Act. I therefore do not consider it necessary or desirable to address the question of whether this post meets the criteria for inclusion in the list of posts under section 2(2) or for exemption from that list, unless or until it is established that the post is not covered by section 2(1)(c).”', '4. Mr Brough', '21. The fourth applicant, Mr Brough, is employed by the Hillingdon Borough Council as the head of its Committee Services Department (a category one post). The provision of services to the Council’s committees necessarily involves the Committee Services Department in frequent contact with and giving advice to the elected members of the Council. Mr Brough was the officer responsible for those activities.', '22. As a consequence of the Regulations, Mr Brough can no longer act as Parliamentary Chairman of his party in Harrow East and is prevented from speaking at public meetings on issues such as housing and the health service. Mr Brough did not apply for exemption from the scope of the Regulations.', 'D. Judicial review proceedings challenging the validity of the Regulations', '23. The applicants and NALGO (the predecessor of UNISON, the trade union of which the applicants are members and which represents public-sector workers) applied for and were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the Regulations. The application was dismissed on 20 December 1991. The judge, Mr Justice Hutchison, considered that he was bound by the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind and Others regarding the status of Article 10 of the Convention in domestic law. In connection with the test of “Wednesbury” unreasonableness, the judge referred to an affidavit submitted by Mr Simcock, a senior civil servant at the Department of the Environment, in which Mr Simcock explained how the Widdicombe Committee (see paragraph 8 above) had been set up in 1985 to inquire into local authority practices and procedures with particular reference to the respective roles of elected members and officers. Mr Simcock also described the consultation process between the publication of the Widdicombe Report and the making of the Regulations, in which NALGO was involved, and how the Regulations were in some respects less restrictive than the Widdicombe Committee’s proposals. Referring to senior officers, the Widdicombe Committee had said:', '“... It is part of their job to advise councillors, and to adjudicate on matters of propriety, and in so doing they must command the respect and trust of all political parties. There might well be some senior officers who are politically active but who are nevertheless totally able to detach themselves from such activity in carrying out their duties as neutral officers. Nevertheless we believe there will always be a very significant risk that they are viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties, and that as a consequence the performance of their duties towards the council as a whole will be impaired.”', 'The judge continued:', '“... I preface my summary by pointing out that some of [the applicants’ complaints] reflect the applicants’ root and branch opposition to the whole concept of restricting the political activities of local government employees. It is said that :', '(a) There was no pressing social need for the Regulations – local government employees have in the past provided impartial advice and there is public confidence in their ability to do so.', '(b) The definition of [persons holding politically restricted posts] is unduly wide – a much more restricted category would have served the government’s purpose.', '(c) The restrictions are expressed in broad, subjective and uncertain terms – a vice particularly objectionable where, as here, they seek to restrict fundamental human rights. Thus, in the Schedule references to apparent intention (paragraphs 6 and 7) and to publication in circumstances likely to create an impression (paragraphs 9 and 10) are objectionable, as is paragraph 4 of the Regulations themselves.', '(d) The consequence of the vice mentioned in the previous paragraph is that employees are likely to be treated inconsistently by different employers, by reason of there being room for undue latitude in interpreting the restrictions.', '(e) The Regulations go too far in prohibiting conduct undertaken with apparent intention, etc., or likely to create the impression of support, etc. They should, at most, have proscribed actual political activities.', '(f) The width of the language used means that many non-party political activities, including trade unions and charitable activities, are prohibited.', '(g) The terms are imposed on existing employees, who entered into their contracts of employment on a different basis.', '(h) The restrictions may have an adverse effect on recruitment and lead to resignations by skilled staff.', 'Some of these points will have to be considered individually when I come to deal with further arguments advanced by the applicants under quite different heads, but in the context of Wednesbury unreasonableness I propose only to say that they do not in my judgment come near to establishing a case of perversity. I have already briefly referred to the genesis of the Act and the Regulations in the Widdicombe Report, and to the consultative processes that followed it. Paragraph 51 of the Report contained the recommendation that:', '‘... terms and conditions of [persons holding politically restricted posts] [should include] a prohibition on political activity, including ... (iii) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate;’', 'The Government’s Command Paper in July 1988 (in which, as already mentioned, the view was expressed that the categories of [persons holding politically restricted posts] should be more restricted than the Report proposed) spelt out the essential aim that:', '‘it was important that the post-holder should be seen to be politically impartial but that otherwise, local government employees should not be subject to restrictions on their political activity.’', 'Of the specific arguments mentioned in (a) to (h) above, those in (a), (b), (e), (g) and (h) are, it seems to me, essentially arguments against the whole concept of restricting such activities, and in the circumstances cannot found an attack on Wednesbury grounds. The arguments summarised in (c) and (d) are to the effect that the Regulations are uncertain and incapable of consistent and fair application. As a Wednesbury argument, this contention could not avail the applicants – at least unless the Regulations were void for uncertainty (this would be a distinct ground for challenge) which plainly they are not. Finally, the argument mentioned in (f) is in my view misconceived: the Regulations do not prohibit the kind of activities there mentioned. I shall have more to say on this subject when I deal with the applicants’ specific arguments on vires and legitimate expectation, to the first of which I now turn.”', 'In conclusion, the judge found that the Regulations did not go beyond the policy and purpose of the Act, and rejected an argument that the applicants had a “legitimate expectation” that the Government would not interfere with trade union activities on the basis of an assurance from the then minister for local government matters.', '24. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 26 November 1992. Lord Justice Neill found that the provisions of Article 10 of the Convention did not assist NALGO and the applicants, confirmed that it was not open to the courts below the House of Lords to depart from the traditional Wednesbury grounds in reviewing the decision of a minister who has exercised a discretion vested in him by Parliament, and found that the Regulations were not “Wednesbury unreasonable” or ultra vires. He also agreed with the first-instance judge as to legitimate expectation. The other judges, Lords Justices Russell and Rose, agreed. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.', '25. The House of Lords refused leave to appeal to it on 24 March 1993.']","['II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW', 'A. The Local Government and Housing Act 1989', '1. Statutory amendment of pre-existing contracts', '26. Section 1(5) of the Act provides:', '“The terms of appointment or conditions of employment of every person holding a politically restricted post under a local authority (including persons appointed to such posts before the coming into force of this section) shall be deemed to incorporate such requirements for restricting his political activities as may be prescribed for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made by the Secretary of State.”', '27. The term “persons holding a politically restricted post” is defined by section 2(1) of the Act. It consists of three broad categories of local government officer (excluding headmasters and teachers, who are exempt from the operation of the Regulations by reason of section 2(10) of the Act).', '2. The categories of officers affected', '28. The first category consists of officers who hold certain posts specified in section 2(1)(a) to (f) of the Act, namely the head of the authority’s paid service (section 2(1)(a)); the chief officers (section 2(1)(b) and (c)); the deputy chief officers (section 2(1)(d)); the monitoring officer (section 2(1)(e)); and assistants for political groups (section 2(1)(f)).', 'There are an estimated 12,000 officers in this category according to the Government’s memorial.', 'The chief officers are the heads of the various departments within the local authority’s administration. They consist of “statutory” and “non-statutory” chief officers. These terms are defined in section 2(6) and (7) of the Act respectively. The “statutory” chief officers are the chief education officer, the chief officer of the fire brigade, the director of social services or director of social work, and the chief financial officer. A “non-statutory” chief officer is defined as, inter alia, a person for whom the head of the authority’s paid service is responsible (section 2(7)(a)), or a person who, largely or exclusively, reports directly to or is directly accountable to the head of the authority’s paid service (section 2(7)(b)). A “deputy” chief officer is a person who, as regards all or most of the duties of his or her post, is required to report directly or is directly accountable to one or more of the statutory or non-statutory chief officers (section 2(8)). By section 2(9), purely secretarial or clerical staff are not non-statutory chief officers or deputy chief officers.', '29. The second category consists of those local government officers whose annual rate of remuneration exceeds the level specified in section 2(2)(a) and (b) of the Act (“the prescribed level”, which is currently 25,746 pounds sterling per annum or pro rata for part-time posts) and whose posts have not been exempted from the operation of the Regulations.', 'The Government estimate that there are approximately 28,000 officers whose salary exceeded the prescribed level. However, in their view, the number of officers who were actually subject to the Regulations is considerably less than 28,000 since a significant number had either been granted an exemption or would have been entitled to one had they applied.', '30. The third category (defined by section 2(2) (c) of the Act) consists of those local government officers whose annual rate of remuneration is less than the prescribed level but whose duties consist in or involve one or both of the duties identified in section 2(3), namely:', '“(a) giving advice on a regular basis to the authority themselves, to any committee or sub-committee of the authority or to any joint committee on which the authority are represented;', '(b) speaking on behalf of the authority on a regular basis to journalists or broadcasters.”', 'According to the Government’s memorial, there are an estimated 7,000 officers in this category.', '3. The list requirement', '31. Each authority is obliged to prepare a list of persons falling within the second and third categories (section 2(2)). Any officer whose post is included on this list is entitled to be removed from the list on the grounds that his or her duties do not include duties of the kind set out in section 2(3).', '4. The independent adjudicator and exemptions', '32. Section 3 of the Act provides for the appointment of a person to consider applications for exemption from political restriction. If the person appointed (who is called the adjudicator) finds that the duties of a listed post (that is, those posts falling within the second and third categories) do not fall within section 2(3), he or she is required to direct that the post is not to be regarded as a politically restricted post. The authority must then remove the post from the list maintained under section 2(2).', 'According to the Government, as at January 1997, 1,374 applications had been made for exemption of which 1,176 have been granted.', 'B. The Schedule to the 1990 Regulations', '33. The Schedule (Part I) to the Regulations prohibits the participation of persons holding politically restricted posts (including persons appointed to such posts before the coming into force of the Regulations) in elections for the House of Commons, the European Parliament or any local authority either as a candidate (paragraph 1), an election agent (paragraph 3) or a canvasser (paragraph 5). It does not prohibit membership of a political party, but does prohibit the holding of an office within a political party if that would involve participating in the general management of that party or one of its branches (paragraph 4(a)) or representing the party in dealing with others (paragraph 4(b)).', 'Speaking to the public or to a section of the public or publishing any written or artistic work with “the apparent intention of affecting public support for a political party” is also prohibited by paragraphs 6 and 7 of Part II of the Schedule. Under paragraph 8, nothing in paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be construed as precluding the appointee to a politically restricted post from engaging in the activities mentioned in those two paragraphs to such an extent as is necessary for the proper performance of his duties.', 'In accordance with regulation 4 when determining whether a person has breached the terms and conditions set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 regard shall be had to:', '“(a) whether the appointee referred to a political party or to persons identified with a political party, or whether anything said by him or the relevant work promotes or opposes a point of view identifiable as the view of one political party and not of another; and', '(b) where the appointee spoke or the work was published as part of a campaign, the effect which the campaign appears to be designed to achieve.”', 'C. Recent developments', '34. The Government informed the Court in their memorial that a review was then being conducted of the detail of the legislation governing political restrictions on local government officers. The aim of the review was to ensure that the detail of the restrictions imposed was essential for the maintenance of political impartiality of senior local government officials. At the hearing the Government informed the Court that the review had shown that the maintenance in force of the restrictions set out in the Regulations continued to be justified.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '35. Mr Ahmed, Mr Perrin, Mr Bentley, Mr Brough and UNISON, a trade union representing public-sector workers, applied to the Commission on 21 September 1993. They alleged that the Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990 operate to their detriment in a way which denies their rights to freedom of expression (Article 10 of the Convention) and of assembly (Article 11), and their rights to participate fully in the electoral process (Article 3 of Protocol No.1).', '36. The Commission declared the application (no. 22954/93) admissible on 12 September 1995, with the exception of the complaint brought by UNISON. In its report of 29 May 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (thirteen votes to four); that it was not necessary to consider whether there had been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention (thirteen votes to four); and that there had been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No.1 (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '37. The applicants in their memorial and at the hearing requested the Court to find that the facts of the case disclose a breach of their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and to award them just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention.', '38. The Government in reply requested the Court in their memorial and at the hearing to decide and declare that the facts disclose no breach of the applicants’ rights under any of the Articles invoked.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '39. The applicants maintained that the introduction and application of the Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations (see paragraphs 26–33 above) constituted an unjustified interference with their rights to freedom of expression, having regard to the impact which the impugned measures had on the pursuit by them of normal political activities. They relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. ”', '40. The Commission agreed with the applicants’ arguments. The Government did not dispute that the applicants could rely on the guarantees contained in Article 10; nor did they deny that the application of the Regulations interfered with the exercise of their rights under that Article. They contended however that the interferences which resulted from the application of the Regulations to the applicants were justified under the second paragraph of Article 10.', 'A. As to the applicability of Article 10 and the existence of an interference', '41. The Court notes that the guarantees contained in Article 10 of the Convention extend to the applicants irrespective of their status as public servants employed by local government authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 22, § 43; and see paragraph 56 below). This has not been disputed by those appearing before the Court. Nor has it been disputed that the Regulations interfered with the exercise by the applicants of their rights to freedom of expression by curtailing in various ways their involvement in certain forms of political activities. The Court for its part also considers that there have been interferences with the applicants’ rights to freedom of expression and it accepts in this respect the Commission’s summary of the situation which resulted for each of the applicants by virtue of the fact that the nature of his duties brought him within the ambit of the parent legislation and hence the implementing Regulations: Mr Ahmed was unable to stand for elected office; Mr Perrin and Mr Bentley had to resign their respective positions and could no longer canvas for their wives in local elections; Mr Brough could no longer act as Parliamentary Chairman of his political party. All of these activities involved the exercise by the applicants of their rights to freedom of expression in various ways and in particular their rights to impart information and ideas to third parties in the political context.', 'B. As to whether the interferences were justified', '42. The Court observes that the above-mentioned interferences give rise to a breach of Article 10 unless it can be shown that they were “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aim or aims as defined in paragraph 2 and were “necessary in a democratic society” to attain them.', '1. “ Prescribed by law ”', '43. The applicants submitted that the Regulations were imprecise in their wording, making it impossible to foresee with reasonable certainty the consequences which a given action may entail for them. They criticised in particular what they claimed was the vague or purely subjective wording of paragraphs 6 (“section of the public”) and 7 (“apparent intention”) of the Schedule to the Regulations (see paragraph 33 above) as well as the potential for inconsistent application of the restrictions by local authority employers. In their view, such expressions made it extremely difficult to predict whether the views which they espoused in speech or in writing might be interpreted by their employers or by an individual member of the public as tending to affect public support for a particular party. Further, the lack of certainty in predicting how the Regulations might apply in concrete situations had also to be seen as a deterrent to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression since local government officers would inevitably be fearful of acting in a manner which might transgress the Regulations and of incurring penalties as a result.', '44. The Government denied that the expressions used in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations were ambiguous or highly subjective. Their meaning and scope could readily be assessed either from the plain meaning of the words or on the basis of an objective assessment, having regard in particular to the guidance offered by regulation 4 to the interpretation of those paragraphs (see paragraph 33 above). If doubt existed as to the interpretation and application of the paragraphs or of any other provisions in the Regulations and accompanying Schedule in a specific context, advice could be sought.', '45. The Commission noted that the Regulations were framed in rather broad terms and that paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule thereto introduced elements of vagueness and uncertainty. Nevertheless, it agreed with the Government that since the Regulations were intended to lay down rules of general application and to cover a large number of local government officers and contexts it was inevitable that the measures were couched in relatively broad terms. Read as a whole and having regard in particular to the terms of regulation 4, the Regulations satisfied in the Commission’s opinion the test of foreseeability for the purposes of the “prescribed by law” requirement of paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '46. The Court notes that the impugned Regulations were designed to lay down a framework of rules restricting the participation of a substantial number of local government officers within the categories defined in the parent legislation in certain kinds of political activities which might impair the duty of impartiality which they owed to their local authorities. It is inevitable that conduct which may call into question an officer’s impartiality in the eyes of third parties cannot be defined with absolute precision. For this reason, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations define types of conduct which have the potential to undermine an officer’s impartiality. Even accepting that it may be difficult on occasions for an officer to assess whether a given action may or may not fall foul of the Regulations, it is nevertheless open to him or her to seek advice beforehand either from the employer or from the union or other source. It must also be stressed that the scope and application of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule, like the Regulations as a whole, have to be considered in the light of the vice which the parent legislation sought to avoid. To that end, regulation 4 (see paragraph 33 above) must be considered a helpful aid to gauging the acceptability of a particular course of action from the standpoint of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations.', '47. As to the applicants’ contention that the decision to entrust the interpretation and implementation of the Regulations to each local government employer only serves to promote inconsistencies in the application of the restrictions, the Court notes that the applicants have not adduced any evidence to show that this has been the case. In any event, an officer who has been disciplined for having breached the Regulations could appeal to an industrial tribunal whose decisions over time would undoubtedly help to promote a harmonised approach to the interpretation of the Regulations.', '48. Having regard to these considerations, the Court finds that the interferences were “prescribed by law”.', '2. Legitimate aim', '49. The applicants repudiated the Government’s view that the interference with their rights could be justified on account of the need to protect the rights of others to effective political democracy. While that aim had been considered legitimate by the Court in its Vogt judgment (cited above), it could not be invoked in the instant case given that the applicants’ involvement in normal political activities did not represent any threat to the constitutional or democratic order of the respondent State. The Government’s reliance on this aim ignored the background against which the measures challenged in the Vogt case had been adopted and the reasons which led the Court to conclude that those measures pursued a legitimate aim in the particular context of post-war Germany.', '50. The Government defended their view that the Regulations were essential to the proper functioning of the democratic system of local government in the United Kingdom. They stressed that, in line with the conclusions and recommendations of the Widdicombe Committee (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), the restrictions contained in the Regulations were intended to strengthen the tradition of political neutrality on the part of specific categories of local government officers by prohibiting them from participating in forms of political activity which could compromise the duty of loyalty and impartiality which they owed to the democratically elected members of local authorities.', '51. The Commission did not take any final position on whether the restrictions imposed by the Regulations pursued a legitimate aim and if so which one. It was prepared to assume for the purposes of its examination of the merits of the applicants’ complaints that the Regulations were designed to preserve the existence of an effective political democracy and that that aim was compatible with the aim of protecting the rights of others within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '52. The Court does not accept the applicants’ argument that the protection of effective democracy can only be invoked as a justification for limitations on the rights guaranteed under Article 10 in circumstances where there is a threat to the stability of the constitutional or political order. To limit this notion to that context would be to overlook both the interests served by democratic institutions such as local authorities and the need to make provision to secure their proper functioning where this is considered necessary to safeguard those interests. The Court recalls in this respect that democracy is a fundamental feature of the European public order. That is apparent from the Preamble to the Convention, which establishes a very clear connection between the Convention and democracy by stating that the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are best ensured on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understanding and observance of human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, pp. 21–22, § 45). For the Court this notion of effective political democracy is just as applicable to the local level as it is to the national level bearing in mind the extent of decision-making entrusted to local authorities and the proximity of the local electorate to the policies which their local politicians adopt. It also notes in this respect that the Preamble to the Council of Europe’s European Charter of Local Self-Government (European Treaty Series no. 122) proclaims that “local authorities are one of the main foundations of any democratic regime”.', '53. The Court observes that the local government system of the respondent State has long rested on a bond of trust between elected members and a permanent corps of local government officers who both advise them on policy and assume responsibility for the implementation of the policies adopted. That relationship of trust stems from the right of council members to expect that they are being assisted in their functions by officers who are politically neutral and whose loyalty is to the council as a whole. Members of the public also have a right to expect that the members whom they voted into office will discharge their mandate in accordance with the commitments they made during an electoral campaign and that the pursuit of that mandate will not founder on the political opposition of their members’ own advisers; it is also to be noted that members of the public are equally entitled to expect that in their own dealings with local government departments they will be advised by politically neutral officers who are detached from the political fray.', 'The aim pursued by the Regulations was to underpin that tradition and to ensure that the effectiveness of the system of local political democracy was not diminished through the corrosion of the political neutrality of certain categories of officers.', '54. For the above reasons, the Court concludes that the interferences which resulted from the application of the Regulations to the applicants pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10, namely to protect the rights of others, council members and the electorate alike, to effective political democracy at the local level.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) General principles', '55. The Court recalls that in its above-mentioned Vogt judgment (pp. 25–26, § 52) it articulated as follows the basic principles laid down in its judgments concerning Article 10:', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any exceptions must be convincingly established.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it is “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '56. In the same judgment the Court declared that these principles apply also to civil servants. Although it is legitimate for a State to impose on civil', 'servants, on account of their status, a duty of discretion, civil servants are individuals and, as such, qualify for the protection of Article 10 of the Convention (p. 26, § 53)', '(b) Application of the above principles to the instant case', '57. The applicants contended that there was no pressing social need for the restrictions imposed by the Regulations. In their view the Widdicombe Committee had concluded that there was no serious evidence of the political impartiality of senior local government officers having been compromised as a result of their engagement in political activities. Accordingly, there was no need to introduce statutory restrictions to curb activities which had never been seen to constitute a problem.', 'They further submitted that even if it were possible to concede that there was a pressing social need at stake, the restrictions amounted to a disproportionate interference with their rights under Article 10 in view of the fact that they applied to a large number of officers and precluded involvement in a wide range of activities and not solely political ones. They repeated in this context their criticism of the way in which paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule were framed (see paragraph 43 above) and how they may be at risk of sanction for expressing views on trade union concerns as well as on social, economic, and other controversial issues, including local ones, which may be considered by a member of the public as endorsement of a party political line on a particular topic.', 'The applicants maintained that the categories of posts covered by the Regulations were too broadly conceived and absorbed large numbers of local government employees including officers like Mr Perrin who provide local authority committees with purely professional or technical advice having no political content whatsoever. For this reason the Government’s insistence on the fact that the restrictions were imposed using tasks-based criteria could not be sustained. Further, the severity of the restrictions was not mitigated by the role of the adjudicator (see paragraph 32 above). In the first place, category one officers such as Mr Bentley and Mr Brough were not entitled to exemption. Secondly, whether or not the adjudicator exempted an officer in the second and third categories was to a large extent determined by the opinion of the local authority employer who has put the officer’s post on the list of politically restricted posts, as was shown by Mr Ahmed’s experience (see paragraph 14 above).', '58. For these reasons in particular, the applicants requested the Court to find, like the Commission, a breach of Article 10 of the Convention.', '59. The Government disagreed with the applicants’ views on the effects of the Regulations. They contended that the restrictions were entirely in line with the conclusions of the Widdicombe Committee which had backed the need to strengthen the political neutrality of senior officers in the light of specific instances of abuses by officers of their positions and the risks to the preservation of that neutrality attendant on the increased divisions in local government affairs along party political lines (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). Against that background, the introduction of the Regulations had to be considered a proportionate response to a real need which had been properly identified and addressed in accordance with the respondent State’s margin of appreciation in this sector.', 'The Government stressed that the proportionality of the restrictions had to be assessed in the light of the following considerations: firstly, they only applied to at most 2% of an estimated 2,300,000 officers; secondly, the categories of officers subject to the restrictions were clearly defined in accordance with the duties which they performed and where both the fact and appearance of political impartiality were of paramount importance; thirdly, the duties-based approach meant that the restrictions were applied as narrowly as possible and exemptions given on as wide a basis as possible. The Government did not deny that the political impartiality of the applicants had never been called into question as a result of their participation in political activities. However, they reiterated that the applicants’ actual and objective impartiality were critical to the performance of the duties assigned to them and this fact in itself justified the imposition of restrictions.', '60. The Commission agreed with the applicants that the Regulations imposed far-reaching, inflexible and disproportionate restrictions on senior officers such as the applicants, even allowing for the duties and responsibilities which they owed to their respective local authorities and the margin of appreciation of the respondent State in the sector at issue. In the Commission’s view, there had never been any suggestion that the applicants’ professionalism and impartiality had been compromised by their pursuit of political activities. However, the Regulations never allowed for exemption on that account since they were introduced across-the-board to all those officers in the categories caught by the Regulations by means of unilateral amendment of their contracts.', '61. The Court’s task is to ascertain in view of the above-mentioned principles (see paragraphs 55 and 56 above) whether the restrictions imposed on the applicants corresponded to a “pressing social need” and whether they were “proportionate” to the aim of protecting the rights of others to effective political democracy at the local level (see paragraph 54 above). In so doing it must also have regard to the fact that whenever the right to freedom of expression of public servants such as the applicants is in issue the “duties and responsibilities” referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the authorities of the respondent State a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the aim as stated (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 26, § 53).', '62. It is to be observed at the outset that the Widdicombe Committee reported back to the government at the time that it had found specific instances of abuse of power by certain local government officers. The Committee was concerned both about the impact which the increase in confrontational politics in local government affairs would have on the maintenance of the long-standing tradition of political neutrality of senior officers whose advice and guidance were relied on by the members elected to local councils as well as about the increased potential for more widespread abuse by senior officers of their key positions in a changed political context. Those concerns emerged from the Committee’s detailed analysis of the state of local government at the time and its wide-ranging rounds of consultations with interested parties (see paragraph 23 above). There was a consensus among those consulted on the need for action to strengthen the tradition of political neutrality either through legislation or modification of the terms and conditions of officers’ contracts of employment (see paragraphs 8–10 above).', 'In the Court’s view, the Widdicombe Committee had identified a pressing social need for action in this area. The adoption of the Regulations restricting the participation of certain categories of local government officers, distinguished by the sensitivity of their duties, in forms of political activity can be considered a valid response by the legislature to addressing that need and one which was within the respondent State’s margin of appreciation. It is to be observed in this regard that the organisation of local democracy and the arrangements for securing the functioning, funding and accountability of local authorities are matters which can vary from State to State having regard to national traditions. Such is no doubt also the case with respect to the regulation of the political activities of local government officers where these are perceived to present a risk to the effective operation of local democracy, especially so where, as in the respondent State, the system is historically based on the role of a permanent corps of politically neutral advisers, managers and arbitrators above factional politics and loyal to the council as a whole.', '63. As to whether the aim of the legislature in enacting the Regulations was pursued with minimum impairment of the applicants’ rights under Article 10 the Court notes that the measures were directed at the need to preserve the impartiality of carefully defined categories of officers whose duties involve the provision of advice to a local authority council or to its operational committees or who represent the council in dealings with the media. In the Court’s view, the parent legislation has attempted to define the officers affected by the restrictions in as focused a manner as possible and to allow through the exemption procedure optimum opportunity for an officer in either the second or third categories to seek exemption from the restrictions which, by the nature of the duties performed, are presumed to attach to the post-holder (cf. the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 28, § 59). It is to be observed also that the functions-based approach retained in the Regulations resulted in fewer officers being subject to restrictions than would have been the case had the measures been modelled on the Widdicombe Committee’s proposal to apply them to principal officers and above as a general class and irrespective of the duties performed (see paragraph 10 above).', 'It is also to be recalled that the requirement of political neutrality owed by the officers such as the applicants to the council members extends also to the members of the local electorate given that they have cast their votes to enable the political complexion of the council to reflect their view of what policies are best suited to their area (see paragraph 53 above). Hence, it is equally in their interests that officers with influence in the day-to-day running of local government business do not engage in activities which may be wrongly interpreted not only by council members but also by the public as impairing that process. For this reason, the restrictions imposed by the Schedule to the Regulations can reasonably constitute a justified response to the maintenance of the impartiality of officers such as the applicants.', 'It is also to be noted that paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations were not designed to silence all comment on political matters, whether controversial or not. The Court reiterates in this respect that the vice which they are intended to avoid is comment of a partisan nature which judged reasonably can be considered as espousing or opposing a party political view (see paragraph 33 above). The same conclusion can be drawn in respect of the restrictions which are imposed on the activities of officers by reason of their membership of political parties. As with speech and writing of a partisan nature, paragraph 4 of Part I of the Schedule (see paragraph 33 above) is directed at precluding participation in only those types of activity which, on account of their visibility, would be likely to link a politically restricted post-holder in the eyes of the public or council members with a particular party political line. There is no restriction on the applicants’ rights to join a political party or to engage in activities within that party other than the limited restrictions identified by paragraph 4 of the Schedule.', 'For the Court, the reasons advanced by the respondent State to justify the restrictions contained in Parts I and II of the Schedule may be considered both relevant and sufficient. Further, those restrictions apply in such a way as to make an appropriate distinction between the duties and responsibilities which the applicants owed to their local authorities and the pursuit by them of their own personal activities (cf. the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 28, § 59). The Court also notes in this context that the current government since coming to office have conducted a review of the restrictions introduced when they were in opposition. That review has shown that the maintenance in force of the restrictions continues to be justified (see paragraph 34 above).', '64. Nor does the Court consider that the decision to apply the restrictions by means of modification of existing contracts or other legal relationships is fatal to their proportionality. In its view, the authorities of the respondent State cannot be accused of having infringed freedom of expression for avoiding a process of bargaining between the officers concerned and their employers over the introduction of the restrictions; nor can they be criticised for not confining the application of the restrictions to future appointees to politically restricted posts. In neither case would the goal of uniform application of the restrictions to all officers entrusted with similar duties be attained.', '65. Having regard to the need which the Regulations sought to address and to the margin of appreciation which the respondent State enjoys in this area, the restrictions imposed on the applicants cannot be said to be a disproportionate interference with their rights under Article 10 of the Convention.', 'The Court concludes therefore that there has been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention by reason of the existence of the legislation and its impact on the applicants’ rights under that Article in the circumstances of this case.', 'ii. alleged violation of article 11 of the convention', '66. The applicants submitted that the restrictions imposed by the Regulations on their holding of office and being active in political parties of which they are members seriously impeded the exercise of their rights to freedom of association in violation of Article 11 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.”', '67. The applicants maintained that the right guaranteed to an individual under Article 11 to join a political party must be taken to include the right to be active in an organisational and administrative capacity in that party and to be an officer-holder. However the restrictions contained in the impugned Regulations precluded this (see paragraph 33 above). They relied on the same reasons which they had adduced under their Article 10 complaints to contest the validity of the Regulations from the standpoint of Article 11.', '68. The Government replied essentially that the reasons which they had advanced to justify the restrictions on the applicants’ Article 10 rights were an equally valid response to the applicants’ allegations under Article 11.', '69. The Commission considered that the applicants’ complaints under Article 10 lay at the heart of their case. Having found a violation of that Article, it concluded that it was unnecessary to examine separately the merits of their complaints under Article 11.', '70. The Court notes that it has found the interferences with the applicants’ rights under Article 10 to be justified from the standpoint of the requirements of the second paragraph of that Article. Notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 must in the present case also be considered in the light of Article 10 having regard to the fact that the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas is one of the objectives of freedom of assembly and association as enshrined in Article 11 (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 30, § 64).', 'In the Court’s view, the conclusions which it reached regarding the foreseeability of the impugned measures, the legitimacy of the aim pursued by them and their necessity hold true for the purposes of the requirements of the second paragraph of Article 11. It would also reiterate that paragraph 4 of the Schedule to the Regulations (see paragraphs 33 and 63 above) is limited to restricting the extent of the applicants’ participation in an administrative and representative capacity in a political party of which they are members. The Regulations do not restrict the applicants’ right to join any political party of their choosing.', '71. The Court finds accordingly that there has been no violation of the applicants’ rights under Article 11 of the Convention.', 'iii. alleged violation of article 3 of protocol no. 1', '72. The applicants further alleged that the Regulations amounted to a breach of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:', '“The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”', '73. The applicants referred in particular to the impact which the restrictions contained in paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations had on their rights to stand for election at local, national and European levels and to take part in electoral campaigns (see paragraph 33 above). In their view, these restrictions were such as to impair the very essence of the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of legislature by limiting without justification the electorate’s choice of candidates.', '74. The Commission, with whom the Government agreed, found that there had been no violation of the above-mentioned Article. It considered that in view of the limitations inherent in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the aim pursued by the restrictions it could not be said that the essence of the applicants’ rights to stand for election had been impaired or that the respondent State had exceeded its margin of appreciation in imposing such restrictions. In particular there was nothing to prevent any of the applicants from resigning his position so as to stand as a candidate in an election.', '75. The Court recalls that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 implies subjective rights to vote and to stand for election. As important as those rights are, they are not, however, absolute. Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them forth in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for implied limitations. In their internal legal orders the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. The Court considers that the restrictions imposed on the applicants’ right to contest seats at elections must be seen in the context of the aim pursued by the legislature in enacting the Regulations, namely, to secure their political impartiality. That aim must be considered legitimate for the purposes of restricting the exercise of the applicants’ subjective right to stand for election under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1; nor can it be maintained that the restrictions limit the very essence of their rights under that provision having regard to the fact that they only operate for as long as the applicants occupy politically restricted posts; furthermore, any of the applicants wishing to run for elected office is at liberty to resign from his post.', '76. Without taking a stand on whether local authority elections or elections to the European Parliament are covered by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, as was also disputed by the Government, the Court concludes that there has been no breach of that provision in this case.']",2,gb,001-58222,0

Mr Eşref Yaşa, a Turkish citizen, was born in 1962 and currently lives in Diyarbakır. His uncle, Mr Haşim Yaşa, was born in 1956 and also lived in Diyarbakır. He was killed on 14 June 1993.', '7. The applicant lodged an application with the Commission “on his own behalf and on behalf of his deceased uncle” (see paragraph 56 below), in which he complained that they had been victims of armed attacks because they sold the newspaper Özgür Gündem. The attacks were part of a campaign orchestrated against that and other pro-Kurdish newspapers with the connivance or even the direct participation of State agents.', 'Some of the events that led to the application being made are disputed.', 'A. The applicant’s and the Government’s versions of the facts', '1. The applicant’s version', '(a) The incidents involving the applicant and his uncle', '8. At the material time the applicant rented a newspaper kiosk, known as the Bulvar Buffet, in the town of Diyarbakır. In October 1992 he began to receive death threats from the police because he sold certain newspapers, in particular the pro-Kurdish paper Özgür Gündem.', '9. In the early hours of 15 November 1992 the applicant’s kiosk was set on fire and destroyed. The applicant estimated the damage at 70,000,000 Turkish liras.', '10. About a week before that incident, the applicant had been visited by two police officers, one of whom was Superintendent Kemal Fidan of the Diyarbakır Security Branch. The applicant did not know the other officer’s name. They had threatened to burn down his kiosk because of the newspapers he sold.', '11. After the applicant’s kiosk had been burnt down, other newsagents had decided to stage a one-day protest strike and refused to sell anything.', '12. At 7.15 a.m. on 15 January 1993 shots had been fired at the applicant while he was in Turistik Street in the Mardinkapı district of Diyarbakır. He had been riding his bicycle from home to the kiosk with his son Diren on the back, when he noticed two suspicious-looking men, one tall and the other of average height, aged about 20–25. Fearing their intentions were hostile, the applicant had attempted to steer his bicycle away but had been struck by a taxi. He and his son had fallen to the ground. At that moment one of the two men had started to shoot at him. In self-defence, the applicant had drawn a pistol from his waist and fired six shots back, none of which had hit the two men. The applicant, however, had been hit by eight bullets fired by the assailant. Three had grazed his back and one his right leg. One had entered his right arm and one his left wrist. One bullet had lodged between the forefinger and middle finger of his left hand and one had gone through his right buttock into his abdomen.', '13. The applicant was taken by taxi to Diyarbakır Hospital. He had asked the driver to deliver his pistol to one of his relatives. The driver had given it instead to another taxi driver who knew the applicant’s kiosk. He had put the pistol in a scrap-box tin under the counter of the kiosk.', '14. The operation to remove the bullets from the applicant’s body, which was performed in the intensive care unit of Diyarbakır Hospital, was held up for two hours by the police. His relatives were later subjected to insults and received death threats at the hospital.', '15. The applicant spent eleven days in hospital. He still had health problems as a result of the attack. He suffered pain in his left arm and several fingers of his left hand and there was continuing discomfort from the scars. In addition, he had stomach pains caused by an infection contracted following the operation.', '16. While in hospital the applicant had made a statement to the police in which he claimed that his assailants were police officers. At no stage had the public prosecutor’s office asked him to make a statement about the attack.', '17. After coming out of hospital he was prosecuted for carrying an unlicensed firearm. On 24 May 1993 he was convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment, later converted by the court to a fine of 1,633,333 Turkish liras, to be paid in instalments over four months. His appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed.', '18. At about 7.30 a.m. on 14 June 1993 the applicant’s uncle, Haşim Yaşa, who had been running the applicant’s kiosk since March 1993, was shot in the head and killed by an unknown assailant while walking along Sunay Avenue in Diyarbakır. Haşim Yaşa’s seven-year old son, Aziz, was the only witness to the shooting. On the same day, the applicant was arrested, assaulted and threatened with death by the police, who told him that they had carried out the shooting and that he had been the intended target.', '19. On 10 October 1993 the applicant’s younger brother, Yalçın Yaşa, aged 13, who had been looking after the kiosk following the attacks on the applicant and his uncle, was killed by an unknown assailant near his home. Another of the applicant’s brothers, Yahya Yaşa, aged 16, was seriously injured during the attack.', '20. Following that attack the applicant was forced to sell his business because there was no one left in his family to manage the kiosk.', '(b) The campaign of attacks against people distributing pro-Kurdish newspapers', '21. The applicant alleged that he and his uncle had been shot because of their involvement in the distribution of the newspaper Özgür Gündem. The incidents had been part of a campaign of persecution and attacks against people engaged in the publication and distribution of that and other pro-Kurdish newspapers. To support that claim, the applicant referred to the following incidents.', '(i) Closure of the Özgür Gündem', '22. Publication of the Özgür Gündem had ceased in April 1994 as a result of a wave of prosecutions brought against it by the State. Since first appearing in May 1992, the newspaper had been the subject of several prosecutions, confiscation orders and temporary closure orders. While the newspaper had never been officially banned from sale, there had been periods when confiscation and closure orders had affected its publication and distribution. The Özgür Ülke, the successor to the Özgür Gündem, was forced to close in February 1995 and the Yeni Politika, which replaced it, ceased publication in August 1995.', '(ii) Attacks on the Özgür Gündem staff', '23. The applicant has supplied lists detailing cases of attacks on, ill ‑ treatment or detention of and threats against staff and distributors of the Özgür Gündem and similar newspapers in 1992, 1993 and early 1994. He maintained that those incidents clearly established that there was a pattern of targeting persons working for the Özgür Gündem.', '24. The applicant stated that at least seven journalists, including Musa Anter, working for the Özgür Gündem had been killed, while others had been injured in attacks. Numerous other journalists had been detained and, in some instances, subjected to ill-treatment.', '25. There had been numerous prosecutions of the owners, editors and journalists of the Özgür Gündem on the basis, inter alia, of the provision under the Prevention of Terrorism Act prohibiting propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State. In addition, Behçet Cantürk, one of the principal financiers of the Özgür Gündem, was murdered (see paragraph 46 below).', '26. The applicant stated that several newspaper kiosks were attacked for selling the Özgür Gündem. In addition, on 3 December 1994 the headquarters of the Özgür Gündem in Istanbul and its office in Ankara were bombed. One person was killed and eighteen injured.', '27. There had also been numerous incidents in which persons and vehicles involved in the distribution of the Özgür Gündem had been attacked. The applicant stated that at least eleven vendors or distributors have been killed, including Yalçın Yaşa (see paragraph 19 above) and Haşim Yaşa (see paragraph 18 above). Several others had been beaten or severely injured, while many more had been threatened with violence if they did not stop selling or distributing the newspaper.', '28. To support his assertions the applicant referred to various publications containing information and expressing concerns about infringements of freedom of expression in Turkey, including, “What happened to the press in 1993”, published by the Özgür Gündem, extracts from 1993 Info-Türk (E.208-7, E.209-6, E.212-8/9), the United States’ State Department Report for Turkey 1994 and “ L’intimidation – rapport sur les meurtres de journalistes et les pressions sur la presse turque ” by Reporters sans frontières (January 1993).', '2. The Government’s version', '(a) The incidents involving the applicant and his uncle', '29. The Government confirmed that the applicant had been shot and his uncle killed on 15 January 1993 and 14 June 1993 respectively. In their memorial they referred to the investigations of the public prosecutors, which commenced on the same day as the attacks (see paragraphs 35 and 41 below). Those investigations, which were being conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 48 below), were still pending.', '30. The Government maintained that there was no evidence to support the applicant’s contention that members of the security forces were responsible for the attacks on the applicant and his uncle. In addition, they denied all allegations of ill-treatment by the State authorities. They said that the applicant had never officially complained to the relevant authorities that his attackers were agents of the State. Moreover, there was no evidence to support the applicant’s allegation that a police officer had told him that it was in fact he who had been the target of his uncle’s killers.', '(b) The campaign of attacks against people distributing pro-Kurdish newspapers', '31. The Government refuted any allegation that there had been official intimidation of persons in any way connected with the sale of newspapers. They said that such newspapers were sold in hundreds of kiosks and were freely available throughout Turkey. The Government acknowledged that on certain occasions particular editions of those newspapers had been confiscated (see paragraph 22 above). However, the measures, which were neither arbitrary nor repressive, were always made on the basis of judicial decisions.', 'B. The Commission’s findings of fact', '32. Noting that the allegations were of a width and character that would not be easily amenable to clarification from oral testimony, the Commission decided, after consulting the parties, to examine the allegations on the basis of the written materials submitted by the parties. The findings of the Commission can be summarised as follows.', '1. The findings concerning the shooting of the applicant and the killing of his uncle', '33. The Commission observed that the facts at the heart of the application were not disputed. The applicant was shot at and seriously injured in an attack by two men on 15 January 1993. His uncle, Haşim Yaşa, was shot and killed by a gunman on 14 June 1993.', '34. The Commission found that there was no evidence before it that proved beyond reasonable doubt that agents of the security forces or police were involved in the shooting of either the applicant or his uncle. It also found that the applicant’s complaints concerning police obstruction at the hospital and ill-treatment in custody following his uncle’s funeral had not been substantiated. However, having regard to “appeals made for protection and protests made by Mr Yaşar Kaya, [a] journalist and [the] owner of the Özgür Gündem, at ministerial level and to the considerable number of attacks on persons connected with that newspaper”, the Commission found that the Government had or ought to have been aware that those involved in its publication and distribution feared that they were falling victim to a concerted campaign tolerated, if not approved, by State agents (see paragraph 104 of the Commission’s report).', '2. Proceedings before the domestic authorities', '(a) Proceedings concerning the shooting of the applicant', '35. According to a police report dated 15 January 1993 the shooting took place at about 7.15 a.m. in Turistik Street. Fifteen empty cartridges and two bullet shells were taken for forensic examination, and a plan of the scene was drawn up. On the day of the shooting the police recovered the applicant’s pistol from his kiosk. They arrested Ş. Altunhan at the kiosk and two taxi drivers, one being the driver to whom the applicant had entrusted the pistol and the other being the driver who had taken it to the kiosk (see paragraph 13 above). The police had then taken detailed statements from them.', '36. In response to an enquiry of 15 January 1993 from the security police, the hospital doctor recorded the following injuries to the applicant: one bullet entry to the left gluteal region, one bullet entry and exit to the middle left forearm, one bullet scratch to the left index finger, one bullet entry and exit on the middle front upper right arm between the elbow and axillary region and a bullet track slightly below the skin tissue, surfacing under the arm.', '37. On 17 January 1993, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant had given a statement to the police in which he had described the attack. He stated that the assailants had intended to murder him because he ran a newspaper kiosk that mainly sold left-wing newspapers. He explained that, as there had been previous attacks on newsagents selling such papers, he had bought the pistol and had been carrying it with him for three or four days before the attack (see paragraph 16 above).', '38. A summary incident report dated 17 January 1993 on the shooting, entitled “crime record no. 1993/C-14”, referred to the applicant as an injured suspect and stated that the other (unidentified) suspects were at large.', '39. On 20 January and 14 April 1993 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor had requested the relevant security branch to investigate the attack on the applicant and to apprehend the suspects. On the latter date the public prosecutor had also requested that the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office be kept informed of the progress of the inquiries every three months until the end of the statutory prescription period, namely 15 January 1998.', '40. An expert ballistics report from the Diyarbakır regional criminal police laboratory dated 11 February 1993 indicated that the cartridges found by the police at the scene of the shooting showed traces and marks identical to those in the shooting of two other people in Diyarbakır on 3 November 1992 and 11 February 1993 respectively.', '(b) The killing of Haşim Yaşa', '41. A preliminary investigation file no. 1993/2248 had been opened into the killing of Haşim Yaşa. According to an autopsy report dated 14 June 1993, four bullet entry wounds had been found on Haşim Yaşa’s body, two of which were fatal.', '42. Following the shooting, the police had prepared a sketch of the scene of the incident and had taken statements on 14 June 1993 from two witnesses. According to V. Şimşek, after hearing the shots, he had seen someone, whom he was unable to identify, running behind the people gathering in the street. R. Orhan, who ran a stall in the street, had heard but not seen the shooting. On reaching the scene, he had helped Haşim Yaşa, who was lying on the ground, get into a taxi so that he could be taken to hospital.', '43. The record made by the police on questioning Haşim Yaşa’s son had indicated that although the boy had seen the assailant he had not recognised him. He said that the assailant – aged 20 to 25 and approximately 1.70 m tall – had continued to fire at his father even though the latter had fallen to the ground after the first shot. The attacker had then made his escape.', '44. An expert ballistics report dated 21 June 1993 indicated that the bullet shells retrieved from the scene were too deformed for useful examination.', '(c) Subsequent progress in the investigations', '45. No other information concerning any investigative measures taken in relation to those incidents was included with the documents from the investigation file provided to the Commission. However, appended to the Government’s written observations before the Commission was a letter which the public prosecutor attached to the Diyarbakır National Security Court had sent on 2 November 1995 to the Minister of Justice in which he said:', '“[The] allegation ... is wholly untrue. There are no gunmen working for the State in south-east Anatolia. In [that] region there are armed conflicts between armed organisations and conflicts arising out of the settling of scores within such organisations. The allegation that these incidents are attributable to the State and gunmen acting on its behalf is outrageous...”', 'C. New evidence produced to the Court', '46. Before the Court, the applicant has produced a copy of a recent report by the Board of Inspectors within the Prime Minister’s office. That confidential report (“the Susurluk report [3] ”) was initially intended to be only for the Prime Minister, who had commissioned it on 13 August 1997. After receiving the report in January 1998, it would appear that the Prime Minister then made it available to the public, although eleven pages from the body of the report and its appendices were withheld. The report continued to be the centre of attention in Turkey while the Court was considering the case.', 'The introduction states that the report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigative report. It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events that had occurred mainly in south-east Turkey which tended to confirm the existence of a tripartite relation involving unlawful dealings between political figures, government institutions and clandestine groups.', 'The report analyses a series of events, such as murders carried out under orders, the killings of well-known figures or supporters of the Kurds and deliberate acts by a group of “informants” supposedly serving the State and concludes that there is a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that had been formed as a result, particularly in the drug-trafficking sphere. The passages from the report that concern certain matters affecting radical periodicals distributed in the region are reproduced below.', '“... In his confession to the Diyarbakır Crime Squad, ... Mr G. ... had stated that Ahmet Demir [4] ( page 35 ) would say from time to time that he had planned and procured the murder of Behçet Cantürk [5] and other partisans from the mafia and the PKK who had been killed in the same way... The murder of ... Musa Anter [6] had also been planned and carried out by A. Demir ( page 37 ).', '...', 'Summary information on the antecedents of Behçet Cantürk, who was of Armenian origin, are set out below ( page 72 ).', '...', 'As of 1992 he was one of the financiers of the newspaper Özgür Gündem. ... Although it was obvious who Cantürk was and what he did, the State was unable to cope with him. Because legal remedies were inadequate the Özgür Gündem was blown up with plastic explosives [7] and when Cantürk started to set up a new undertaking, when he was expected to submit to the State, the Turkish Security Organisation decided that he should be killed and that decision was carried out ( page 73 ).', '...', 'All the relevant State bodies were aware of these activities and operations. ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined, the difference between those Kurdish supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter presented in economic terms. ... The sole disagreement we have with what was done relates to the form of the procedure and its results. It has been established that there was regret at the murder of Musa Anter, even among those who approved of all the incidents. It is said that Musa Anter was not involved in any armed action, that he was more concerned with the philosophy of the matter and that the effect created by his murder exceeded his own real influence and that the decision to murder him was a mistake. (Information about these people is to be found in Appendix 9 [8] ). Other journalists have also been murdered ( page 74 ) [9] .”']","['ii. relevant domestic law and practice', '47. The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows.', 'A. Criminal prosecutions', '48. Under the Criminal Code all forms of homicide (Articles 448 to 455) and attempted homicide (Articles 61 and 62) constitute criminal offences. The authorities’ obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities or members of the security forces as well as to the public prosecutors’ offices. The complaint may be made in writing or orally. If it is made orally, the authority must make a record of it (Article 151).', 'If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes, members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge (Article 152). By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor’s office an offence of which he has become aware in the course of his duty shall be liable to imprisonment.', 'A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution (Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).', '49. If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties, the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants, which restricts the public prosecutor’s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings. In such cases it is for the relevant local Administrative Council (for the district or province, depending on the suspect’s status) to conduct the preliminary investigation and, consequently, decide whether to prosecute. Once a decision to prosecute has been taken, it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case.', 'An appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court lies against a decision of the Council. If a decision not to prosecute is taken, the case is automatically referred to that court.', '50. By virtue of Article 4, paragraph (i), of Legislative Decree no. 285 of 10 July 1987 on the authority of the governor of the state of emergency region, the 1914 Law (see paragraph 49 above) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor’s authority.', '51. If the suspect is a member of the armed forces, the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence. Thus if it is a “military offence” under the Military Criminal Code (Law no. 1632), the criminal proceedings are in principle conducted in accordance with Law no. 353 on the establishment of courts martial and their rules of procedure. Where a member of the armed forces has been accused of an ordinary offence, it is normally the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure which apply (see Article 145 § 1 of the Constitution and sections 9–14 of Law no. 353).', 'The Military Criminal Code makes it a military offence for a member of the armed forces to endanger a person’s life by disobeying an order (Article 89). In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 48 above) or with the offender’s superior.', 'B. Civil and administrative liability arising out of criminal offences', '52. Under section 13 of Law no. 2577 on administrative procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation from them. If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings.', '53. Article 125 §§ 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides:', '“All acts or decisions of the authorities shall be subject to judicial review…', '...', 'The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.”', 'That provision establishes the State’s strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people’s lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons.', '54. Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 430 of 16 December 1990, the last sentence of which was inspired by the provision mentioned above (see paragraph 53 above), provides:', '“No criminal, financial or legal liability may be asserted against … the governor of the state of emergency region or provincial governors in that region in respect of decisions taken, or acts performed, by them in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this Legislative-Decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to that end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim reparation from the State for damage which they have been caused without justification.”', '55. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages for pecuniary loss (Articles 41–46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal court on the issue of the defendant’s guilt (Article 53).', 'However, under section 13 of Law no. 657 on State employees, anyone who has sustained loss as a result of an act done in the performance of duties governed by public law may, in principle, only bring an action against the authority by whom the civil servant concerned is employed and not directly against the civil servant (see Article 129 § 5 of the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations). That is not, however, an absolute rule. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an “administrative” act or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim’s right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the official’s employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '56. The applicant applied to the Commission on 12 July 1993, complaining of attacks in which he had been seriously injured and his uncle killed. He also complained that he had been ill-treated by the police while in detention and had not had access to a court or an effective remedy in respect of the attacks and ill-treatment. He relied on Articles 2, 3, 6, 10, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention.', '57. The Commission declared the application (no. 22495/93) partly admissible on 3 April 1995. In its report of 8 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention (thirty votes to two); that there had been no violation of Article 3 (unanimously); that the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 did not give rise to any separate issue and that there had been no violation of Article 10 (thirty-one votes to one); that the applicant’s complaint under Article 13 did not give rise to any separate issue (thirty votes to two); that there had been no violation of Article 14 or Article 18 (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [10].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '58. The applicant decided not to proceed with the complaints he had made under Articles 3 and 6 before the Commission. In his memorial and at the hearing, he asked the Court to hold that the facts of the case disclosed breaches of Articles 2, 10 and 13, taken individually or jointly with Article 14, and of Article 18 and that those breaches were aggravated by the existence of a practice tolerated by the respondent State. In that connection, he invited the Court to accept the contents of the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above) as new evidence relevant to his complaints (see paragraphs 21–28 above).', 'He also asked the Court to order the respondent State both to pay a sum by way of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and pecuniary damage he had sustained and non-pecuniary damage suffered by his uncle’s close relatives and to reimburse the costs and expenses incurred.', '59. The Government, both in their memorial and at the hearing, invited the Court to hold that the application should have been declared inadmissible because the applicant had no standing to make a complaint on behalf of his uncle and domestic remedies had not been exhausted. In the alternative, they submitted with regard to the merits that on the facts of the case there had been no violation of any of the provisions relied on by the applicant. At the hearing, the Government also asked the Court to declare that the Susurluk report was inadmissible in evidence.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. Scope of the case', '60. In their application to the Commission, the applicant’s counsel had alleged a violation of Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention also (see paragraphs 1 and 56 above). In their memorial to the Court, however, they accepted the Commission’s conclusions that there had been no violation of Article 3 and that no separate question arose under Article 6 § 1 (see paragraph 57 above). Since they did not pursue those complaints in the proceedings before it, the Court sees no reason to consider them of its own motion (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 28, § 62).', 'II. THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS', 'A. Whether the applicant was a victim', '61. As they had done before the Commission, the Government argued that Mr Eşref Yaşa had no standing to submit an application on behalf of his deceased uncle, as it had not been proved that they were uncle and nephew and, even if they were, that did not make them direct relatives. Given the small difference in age and the difficulty of establishing who was related to whom and how in Turkey, it was quite possible that the applicant and Mr Yaşa had merely been second, or even third, cousins. In the instant case, there had been nothing to prevent closer relatives of the deceased – of whom there were many – from taking part in the proceedings before the Convention institutions. In addition, the Commission’s case-law on the subject contained no example of a nephew being allowed to exercise the right of petition under Article 25 of the Convention. Nor was it a valid argument to say that the Commission had based its decision on the business relations between the applicant and his uncle, since they did not carry on the same trade and the complaints made in the instant case were not of a commercial nature.', '62. At the hearing, the applicant’s counsel confined themselves to saying that throughout the proceedings before the Commission the Government had acknowledged that Mr Haşim Yaşa was the applicant’s uncle.', '63. In its report, the Commission said that when complaining of the killing of his uncle, the applicant “acts as a person who is himself … affected … and not as his uncle’s representative” (see paragraph 88 of the Commission’s report). At the hearing before the Court, the Delegate of the Commission expressed the view that if a relative wished to complain about a question as serious as the murder of one of his close relations, that ought to suffice to show that he felt personally concerned by the incident.', '64. The Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention, a treaty for the collective enforcement of human rights and fundamental freedoms, requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied in the light of its special character and so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 23 March 1995 ( preliminary objections ), Series A no. 310, pp. 26–27, §§ 70–72).', '65. In the present case, the Government submitted for the first time in their written observations on the Commission’s decision on admissibility that the applicant was not a victim (see paragraphs 13 and 86 of the Commission’s report). The Court observes that the Government did not in those submissions dispute that the deceased was the applicant’s uncle. They are therefore estopped from denying before the Court that the deceased and the applicant were so related. It should also be noted that in his application Mr Eşref Yaşa maintained that the facts of the case amounted to a violation, not only of his deceased uncle’s rights under the Convention, but also of his rights.', 'As to whether the applicant and the deceased had business interests in common and the Government’s affirmation – which is unsubstantiated – that it was highly likely in practice that Mr Haşim Yaşa had a number of close relatives, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine an argument whose outcome would be of no relevance in this case.', '66. The Court shares the opinion of the Commission and the Delegate (see paragraph 63 above and paragraphs 84–88 of the Commission’s report). In the light of the principles established in its case-law (see paragraph 64 above) and of the particular facts of the present case, it holds that the applicant, as the deceased’s nephew, could legitimately claim to be a victim of an act as tragic as the murder of his uncle.', 'Consequently, the Court dismisses this preliminary objection of the Government.', 'B. Failure to exhaust domestic remedies', '67. With regard to Articles 2, 3, 6 and 13 of the Convention, the Government objected that domestic remedies had not been exhausted as the applicant had not brought any of the ordinary civil, administrative or criminal proceedings that were available under Turkish law, despite the fact that they were effective.', 'The Government maintained that the Commission had not correctly decided that objection when considering the admissibility of the application. In particular, the Commission had not taken into account the “deliberate strategy” of the applicant’s lawyers, who had sought to avoid seeking any remedy in Turkey and had made allegations of an “administrative practice” merely to provide a legal argument to cover the omission. However, the applicant, who alleged that he and his uncle had been assaulted by the security forces, could have brought administrative proceedings against the authorities to whom those responsible were accountable (see paragraphs 52–54 above) and civil proceedings for damages for the unlawful acts (see paragraph 55). Lastly, the applicant could have brought criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 48–51).', '68. The applicant’s counsel did not mention the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies either in their memorial or at the hearing before the Court.', '69. At the hearing, the Delegate of the Commission explained that the applicant had asserted that he had made a statement to the police at the hospital where he had been taken after the armed assault to which he had been subject, in which he had said that his assailants were police officers (see paragraph 16 above). With regard to the murder of the applicant’s uncle, the Delegate of the Commission surmised that the applicant’s arrest and the threats and ill-treatment to which he said he had been subject on the same day as the incident might explain why the applicant had not lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. The Delegate also observed that whatever the scope of the applicant’s complaint at the hospital had been, two separate criminal investigations had been started by the relevant public prosecutor’s office. Accordingly, there was no need to require the applicant to have brought other court proceedings or to have waited until the end of those inquiries, which were still under way.', '70. In view of its conclusion as to the scope of the case (see paragraph 60 above), the Court will consider the Government’s preliminary objection only in so far as it concerns the complaints made under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention.', '71. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 26 also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2275–76, §§ 51–52; and the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1210, §§ 65–67).', '72. The Court notes that Turkish law provides civil, administrative and criminal remedies against illegal and criminal acts attributable to the State or its agents (see paragraph 47 above).', '73. As regards a civil action for redress for damage sustained through illegal acts or patently unlawful conduct on the part of State agents (see paragraph 55 above), the Court notes that a plaintiff to such an action must, in addition to establishing a causal link between the tort and the damage he has sustained, identify the person believed to have committed the tort. In the instant case, however, it appears that it is still unknown who was responsible for the acts the applicant complained of (see paragraphs 29 and 35–45 above).', '74. With respect to an action in administrative law under Article 125 of the Constitution based on the authorities’ strict liability (see paragraphs 52–53 above), the Court reiterates that a remedy indicated by the Government must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory (see, among other authorities, the Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 17, § 42). However, the file supplied to the Court contains no example of any person having brought such an action in a situation comparable to the applicant’s (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sakık and Others v. Turkey judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports 1997–VII, p. 2634, § 53). Furthermore, as the Court has already noted, an administrative-law action is a remedy based on the strict liability of the State, in particular for the illegal acts of its agents, whose identification is not, by definition, a prerequisite to bringing an action of this nature. However, the investigations which the Contracting States are obliged by', 'Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention to conduct in cases of fatal assault must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see paragraphs 98–100 below). As the Court has previously held, that obligation cannot be satisfied merely by awarding damages (see, among other authorities, the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 329, § 105). Otherwise, if an action based on the State’s strict liability were to be considered a legal action that had to be exhausted in respect of complaints under Articles 2 or 13, the State’s obligation to seek those guilty of fatal assault might thereby disappear.', '75. Consequently, the applicant was not required to bring the civil and administrative proceedings in question and the preliminary objection concerning proceedings of that nature is unfounded.', '76. Lastly, with regard to the criminal-law remedies, the Court notes that on 17 January 1993, at the Diyarbakır Social-Security Hospital, police officers took the applicant’s statement on the incident which had taken place on 15 January (see paragraph 37 above). It would appear from the record that was drawn up as a result that the applicant was questioned – both as a suspect and a victim – about the firearm he was carrying (see paragraph 17 above). He said that unidentified persons had sought to kill him because he sold radical, left-wing newspapers and he requested that those responsible be found and punished. However, the record does not show that the applicant expressly alleged that his assailants were agents from the security forces (see paragraphs 16, 30 and 37 above). That statement nonetheless constitutes a complaint that was validly lodged in the manner laid down by the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 48 above). Irrespective of the content of that complaint, it is undisputed that two separate criminal investigations were begun by the judicial authorities, one concerning the assault on the applicant (see paragraph 35 above) and the other, the murder of his uncle (see paragraph 41 above).', '77. The Court emphasises that the application of the exhaustion of domestic remedies rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 26 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means in particular that the Court must take realistic account, not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1221, § 69, and the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2276, §§ 53 and 54).', '78. The Court considers that this last limb of the Government’s preliminary objection raises issues that are closely linked to those raised by the applicant’s complaints under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention.', '79. Consequently, the Court dismisses the Government’s preliminary objection in so far as it relates to the civil and administrative remedies relied on (see paragraph 75 above). It joins the preliminary objection concerning remedies in criminal law to the merits (see paragraphs 98–107 and 111 ‑ 14 below).', 'III. alleged violations of article 2 of the convention', '80. The applicant alleged that members of the security forces had attempted to kill him on 15 January 1993 and had murdered his uncle, Haşim Yaşa, on 14 June. He also complained that no adequate and effective judicial investigation had been conducted into the circumstances of either his assault or his uncle’s murder. He argued that, in both his and the deceased’s cases, there had been a breach of Article 2 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.', '2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:', '(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;', '(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;', '(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”', 'In support of his allegations, the applicant produced the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above).', '81. The Government disputed that argument. The Commission considered that Article 2 had been infringed only in that the authorities had failed to carry out an adequate criminal investigation into the facts of the case.', 'A. Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '1. The applicant', '82. The applicant asked the Court to follow the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in that there had been no adequate and effective investigation into the alleged facts. He also invited the Court to find that the assault he had suffered and his uncle’s murder had been carried out by State agents.', '83. In that connection, the applicant’s counsel, relying on Article 28 of the Convention, complained that the Government had not communicated the relevant information to the Commission at the appropriate time, which would have made it easier to establish the truth. They requested in particular that the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above) be accepted at this stage of the proceedings as new evidence supporting the complaints made in their initial application. In their submission, that report – which had been commissioned by the Prime Minister, who had confirmed its content and credibility in televised interviews – destroyed the Government’s case. Although it did not enable those responsible for the relevant attacks to be identified, the report contained very serious admissions and an acknowledgment that attacks for which no one claimed responsibility and which were classified as “ faili meçhul ” (unknown perpetrator) had in fact been ordered by senior figures in the security forces. That information was directly relevant to the incidents at the origin of the present case. Since it called into question the State’s denials as to the implication of the State machinery in the killings of and assaults on journalists and sellers of newspapers such as the Özgür Gündem, it deprived the statements made and evidence lodged by the Government earlier in the proceedings of all credibility. The Susurluk report was consequently of crucial importance in providing an answer to the question – which had been left open in the Commission’s report (see paragraph 34 above) – whether the applicant and his uncle were victims of a campaign of violence waged with the State’s connivance.', '2. The Government', '84. The Government maintained that the applicant’s allegations were unfounded and that the file produced by him did not contain anything capable of explaining how responsibility for the alleged events could be attributed to the security forces (see paragraph 30 above). The only evidence that had been produced by the applicant’s counsel were lists of alleged acts of repression against journalists, which had themselves been drawn up on the basis of press releases emanating from sympathetic organisations.', '85. The Government said that they agreed with the Commission’s conclusion that the alleged facts were not attributable to State agents. On the other hand, they contested the reasons which the Commission had given for concluding that there had been a breach of the obligation to carry out an effective investigation. The Government said that the investigations concerned were still pending (see paragraph 29 above) and maintained that the relevant authorities had to date conducted those investigations into the contentious events properly, in accordance with usual practice and in a sufficient and appropriate manner, in spite of the fact that the applicant had at no stage lodged a complaint setting out his allegations, either in his own name or on behalf of his uncle (see paragraph 30 above).', 'On that point, the Government contended that the Commission had been imprudent in applying Article 2 without “seeking to find out what measures had been taken by the national authorities to prevent a deterioration in security or what judicial and administrative investigations had been carried out to identify the offenders, whom [the Government] presumed were simply terrorists”. Referring to the Commission’s case-law (application no. 9360/81, decision of 28 February 1983, Decisions and Reports 32, p. 211), the Government submitted that regard should have been had in the present case to the principle that Article 2 could not imply a positive obligation to prevent any possibility of violence occurring.', '86. The Government also submitted that the Commission had not had proper regard, either, to the fact that in the instant case the judicial authorities had – on the very day the incidents had occurred – initiated of their own motion judicial procedures with a view to identifying the assailants. Although the investigations had been unsuccessful as those responsible had not been identified, that did not of itself show that the Turkish authorities had sought to conceal or distort the events. The Government pointed out that in all European countries “there are crimes of murder or assault that are not cleared up, especially where terrorist or criminal organisations are involved”.', 'Consequently, they submitted in the alternative that, as regards their obligation under Article 2 of the Convention, the authorities could not have been expected to do more since the events in the instant case had taken place in “the context of the fight against terrorists, who rarely return to the scene of their crime”. In such circumstances, the police and the judicial authorities were “constrained to proceed with caution and to wait until the results of the various investigations had been cross-checked, thus enabling the perpetrators of earlier crimes and acts of violence to be identified”.', '87. At the hearing, the Government representative contested the evidential value of the Susurluk report. The report currently had no official status. Furthermore, it was not relevant as it had no direct link with the present case. It had been prepared with the sole aim of examining certain allegations so that judicial investigations could be carried out subsequently. It was not therefore the result of a judicial inquiry as such.', 'The Government representative also contested the argument under Article 28 of the Convention based on the lack of cooperation. She said that no document or item of evidence had been concealed and that all the Commission’s questions had been answered, on the basis of information obtained from the Ministry of Justice.', '3. The Commission', '88. Referring to its conclusions (see paragraphs 32–45 above), the Commission emphasised that they had been reached on the basis of the written documents lodged on the case file, in particular those submitted by the Government concerning the police inquiries that had been made, and of the observations made by the parties in response to its questions. In the instant case, it had noted that the allegation that the events in issue had taken place as part of a campaign of attacks against people connected with certain newspapers, such as the Özgür Gündem, was the subject of fierce debate between the parties; that allegation was so serious that it was hardly likely that the facts that had given rise to it would be elucidated by the evidence of the people apt to be concerned.', 'The Commission had also noted that certain cases pending before it (applications nos. 22492/93, 22496/93, 23144/93 and 25301/94) likewise concerned measures taken against and attacks on the Özgür Gündem, and people connected with its publication and distribution.', '89. Notwithstanding its acute concern about the explanations – which, moreover, had not been refuted by the Government – received about the murders of and attacks on several people who had taken part in the distribution of such publications, the Commission had concluded that it could not consider that it had been established beyond all reasonable doubt that members of the security forces or police officers had been implicated in the shootings of the applicant and his uncle.', '90. The Commission had nonetheless noted a number of factors that enabled it to consider that the particular circumstances in which the incidents had occurred imposed on the authorities an obligation to carry out an adequate and effective investigation, in order to determine whether the attacks on the applicant and his uncle could have been connected with actions on the part of members of the security forces. In that regard, the Commission observed that, despite the invitations it had sent to the Government, the latter had confined themselves to complaining of the deceitful nature of the allegations and, generally, of a lack of evidence, and had been unable to provide any satisfactory information at all on the measures that had been taken to verify the truth of the applicant’s allegations (see paragraph 45 above).', 'For that reason, the Commission had concluded that there were deficiencies in the investigations such as to amount to a breach of the obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to protect the right to life (see paragraphs 101–07 of the Commission’s report).', '91. At the hearing, the Delegate of the Commission gave his view on the relevance of the Susurluk report to the determination of the facts of the case. He said that while he had doubts as to the weight the Commission could have attached to that document, in his view, it appeared to support the notion that the State had been implicated in a number of serious human rights’ violations in south-east Turkey that were to a certain degree comparable to the attacks on the applicant and his uncle. However, reiterating that in such cases the liability of the State can only be inferred from facts that have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, the Delegate concluded that the Susurluk report did not provide a sufficient basis for excluding such doubt and invited the Court to accept that the facts were as the Commission had found.', 'B. The Court’s assessment', '1. The attacks on the applicant and his uncle', '92. The Court observes that neither the applicant’s counsel nor the Government dispute in any material particular the facts as established by the Commission. On the other hand, those appearing before the Court completely disagreed about the conclusions to be drawn under Article 2 of the Convention on the basis of those facts.', '93. It is important to remember in this respect that under the Convention system the establishment and verification of the facts are primarily a matter for the Commission (see Articles 28 § 1 and 31 of the Convention). Only in exceptional circumstances will the Court exercise its own powers in this area. However, the Court is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own assessment in the light of all the material before it (see the McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, p. 50, § 169, and the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 321, § 75).', 'In the instant case, the Commission was unable to conclude that the allegation that the attacks had been perpetrated by the security forces had been proved beyond all reasonable doubt (see, among other authorities, the Aydın v. Turkey judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 1889, § 72, and the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 322, § 76). However, the applicant pleaded before the Court that new evidence that had not been before the Commission militated in favour of his version (see paragraph 83 above). In that connection, he referred to the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above), the evidential value of which was, however, firmly contested at the hearing by the representative of the Government (see paragraph 87 above).', '94. The Court reiterates that in determining whether substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the respondent State has not complied with its responsibilities under the Convention, the Court must examine the issues raised before it in the light of the material provided by those appearing before it and, if necessary, of material obtained proprio motu (see, mutatis mutandis, the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 64, § 160, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 29, § 75). Although the Court must refer primarily to the circumstances existing at the time of the incidents complained of, it is not precluded from having regard to information coming to light subsequently (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cruz Varas and Others judgment cited above, p. 30, § 76).', '95. The Court notes that the Susurluk report – which was prepared at the Prime Minister’s request – relates to a series of disturbing events that occurred in the south-eastern region of Turkey (see paragraph 46 above). The fate of certain newspaper-publishing companies, in particular the company which published the Özgür Gündem, is particularly alarming in that regard. According to the author of the report, the cause of that general situation, which has considerably troubled public opinion, has been the Kurdish problem and the means used to combat the PKK in that part of the country.', '96. While it is true that the attainment of the required evidentiary standard (see paragraphs 34 and 91 above) may follow from the co ‑ existence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or unrebutted presumptions (see the Aydın judgment cited above, p. 1888, § 70, and the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 322, § 77), their evidential value must be considered in the light of the circumstances of the individual case and the seriousness and nature of the charge to which they give rise against the respondent State.', 'In the present case, the Court considers that notwithstanding the serious concerns to which it gives rise, the Susurluk report does not contain material enabling the presumed perpetrators of the attacks on the applicant and his uncle to be identified with sufficient precision. Indeed, the applicant admits as much in his memorial (see paragraph 83 above).', '97. Consequently, the Court does not consider that it should depart from the Commission’s conclusions regarding this complaint. It accordingly holds that the material on the case file does not enable it to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that Mr Eşref Yaşa and his uncle were respectively attacked and killed by the security forces.', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 2 on that account.', '2. Alleged inadequacy of the investigations', '98. The Court recalls that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others judgment cited above, p. 48, § 161, and the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 324, § 86).', '99. In the instant case, the Government maintained that there was no evidence that State agents had been implicated in the commission of the alleged acts (see paragraph 84 above). Furthermore, the applicant had at no stage made any explicit accusation to that effect, either in his own name, or on behalf of his uncle (see paragraphs 67 and 76 above).', '100. In that connection, the Court emphasises that, contrary to what is asserted by the Government, the obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is the issue of whether members of the deceased’s family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the killing with the competent investigatory authorities decisive. In the case under consideration, the mere fact that the authorities were informed of the murder of the applicant’s uncle gave rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 to carry out an effective investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, the Ergi v. Turkey judgment of 28 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1778, § 82). The same applies to the attack on the applicant which, because eight shots were fired at him, amounted to attempted murder (see paragraph 36 above).', '101. In the present case, there is no dispute as to what steps the authorities in charge of the preliminary investigation and the competent public prosecutor’s office took following the events in issue (see paragraphs 35–45 above).', 'Following an armed assault on the applicant, a police investigation started that same day, namely on 15 January 1993. At the end of that initial stage, which lasted only two days, Mardinkapı security directorate concluded, in its report of 17 January 1993, that it had not been possible to find those responsible for the attack, or even to identify them. Consequently, on 20 January the Diyarbakır public prosecutor instructed the directorate to pursue its investigation and to arrest the suspects or, if it was unable to do so, to inform him of progress every three months. On 14 April the public prosecutor issued a second set of similar instructions in which he renewed his request to be informed every three months of the results of the police investigations until such time as prosecution of the offence became statute-barred. According to a note in the instructions, that would have been on 15 January 1998 (see paragraph 39 above). Before the Convention institutions, however, the Government did not produce copies of the quarterly reports the police had been instructed to draw up (see paragraph 45 above).', 'The preliminary inquiry into the murder of Mr Haşim Yaşa also began on the day of that incident, namely 14 June 1993. By 21 June the authorities had among other things carried out an autopsy, obtained an expert ballistics report and heard three witnesses, including the deceased’s son. The Court has no information on subsequent developments in that investigation (ibid.).', '102. Yet the Government were aware of Mr Yaşa’s application by 11 October 1993 (see paragraph 6 of the Commission’s report) and the Commission invited the Government to provide it with more precise details concerning the investigative measures that had been taken following the attacks on the applicant, his uncle and other persons connected with certain radical periodicals (see paragraphs 34 and 90 above).', '103. Despite those requests, the Government provided no concrete information on the state of progress of the investigations (see paragraph 90 above and paragraph 105 of the Commission’s report) which, more than five years after the events, do not appear to have produced any tangible result. Admittedly, the Government said that the investigations were still pending, but they did not provide anything to show that they were actually progressing (see paragraphs 29, 35–45 and 86 above). In that regard, the last investigative step of which the Court is aware dates back to 21 June 1993, when the expert ballistics report in the investigation into the murder of Haşim Yaşa was prepared (see paragraph 44 above), whereas the Diyarbakır public prosecutor had on 14 April 1993 requested the police to inform him every three months of progress in the investigation (see paragraph 101 above). The only explanation given by the Government is that the investigations were taking place in the context of the fight against terrorism and that in such circumstances the police and judicial authorities were constrained to “proceed with caution and to wait until the results of the various investigations had been cross-checked, thus enabling the perpetrators of earlier crimes and acts of violence to be identified” (see paragraph 86 above).', '104. The Court is prepared to take into account the fact that the prevailing climate at the time in that region of Turkey, marked by violent action by the PKK and measures taken in reaction thereto by the authorities, may have impeded the search for conclusive evidence in the domestic criminal proceedings. Nonetheless, circumstances of that nature cannot relieve the authorities of their obligations under Article 2 to carry out an investigation, as otherwise that would exacerbate still further the climate of impunity and insecurity in the region and thus create a vicious circle (see mutatis mutandis, the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 326, § 91).', '105. In addition, the Court is struck by the fact that the investigatory authorities appear to have excluded from the outset the possibility that State agents might have been implicated in the attacks. Thus, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır National Security Court considered the incidents in question to have been merely “a settling of scores between armed organisations” (see paragraph 45 above and paragraph 61 of the Commission’s report), whereas the Government considered that all responsibility for the attacks lay with “terrorists”, even though the investigations are not over and no concrete evidence capable of confirming that to be a valid hypothesis has been brought to the attention of the Court (see paragraphs 85 and 86 above).', '106. That approach has to be assessed in the light of the fact that the Commission found that there were a number of attacks involving killings in south-east Turkey on journalists, newspaper kiosks and distributors of the Özgür Gündem and that some of those incidents had even formed the subject matter of applications to it (nos. 22492/93, 22496/93, 23144/93 and 25301/94 – see paragraphs 52–59 of the Commission’s report). The Government have not disputed that the attacks occurred or that they were serious. The Commission also noted that many complaints and requests for protection had been made to the authorities by a journalist, Mr Y. Kaya, who at the time was the proprietor of the newspaper.', 'After considering all the facts of the case, the Commission did not consider that in the case before it “the authorities [were] or [could] have been unaware that those involved in the publication and distribution of the Özgür Gündem feared that they were falling victim to a concerted campaign tolerated, if not approved, by State officials” (see paragraphs 34 and 89 above).', 'Having carried out its own assessment of this aspect of the case, in the light in particular of the findings of the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above), the Court considers that observation to be well-founded. In the instant case, it was therefore incumbent on the authorities to have regard, in their investigations, to the fact that State agents may have been implicated in the attacks. In that connection, whether or not the applicant had formally identified the security forces as being the assailants was of little relevance (see paragraphs 30, 37, 76 and 85 above).', '107. In short, because the investigations carried out in the instant case did not allow of the possibility that given the circumstances of the case the security forces might have been implicated in the attacks and because, up till now, more than five years after the events, no concrete and credible progress has been made, the investigations cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2.', '108. In consequence, the applicant has satisfied the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. It follows that the Court dismisses the criminal-proceedings limb of the Government’s preliminary objection and holds that there has been a violation of Article 2.', 'IV. alleged violation of article 13 of the convention', '109. The applicant complained that he had not had an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:', '“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”', 'The Government contested that argument. The Commission considered that it was unnecessary to examine it separately as no separate issue arose under Article 13.', 'A. Arguments of the parties', '110. The applicant, who disagreed with the Commission’s conclusion, submitted that an independent examination from the one carried out under Article 2 of the Convention was merited in respect of this complaint. He asserted that the legal order and practice in south-east Turkey, which was subject to the state of emergency, had been changed in order deliberately to make the exercise of remedies against the State more difficult. The special legislation in force in that region had established a system which ensured impunity for the security forces, based on the authorities’ strategy of denying the facts and any liability, in order to prevent effective access to domestic remedies.', '111. Referring to their observations on the question of the exhaustion of domestic remedies (see paragraph 67 above), the Government confined themselves to saying that the applicant could not complain of a violation of Article 13.', 'B. The Court’s assessment', '112. The Court observes that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at a national level of a remedy to enforce the Convention rights and freedoms, as secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2286, § 95; the Aydın judgment cited above, p. 1895, § 103; and the Kaya judgment cited above, pp. 329 ‑ 30, § 106).', '113. In the instant case, the Court has concluded that it has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the attacks on the applicant and his uncle were carried out by State agents (see paragraph 97 above). That fact, however, does not necessarily mean that the complaint under Article 2 is not arguable (see, among other authorities, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and the Kaya judgment cited above, pp. 330–31, § 107). The Court’s conclusion as to the merits does not relieve the State of the obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the substance of the complaint, which, for the reasons mentioned above (see paragraph 106), was arguable.', '114. It is also necessary to reiterate that the nature of the right that is alleged to have been infringed has implications on the extent of the obligations under Article 13. Given the fundamental importance of the right to protection of life, Article 13 imposes, without prejudice to any other remedy available under the domestic system including the payment of compensation where appropriate, an obligation on States to carry out a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and in which the complainant has effective access to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kaya, Aksoy and Aydın judgments cited above, § 107, § 98, and § 103 respectively).', '115. The Court reiterates that the authorities had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the attacks (see paragraph 107 above). However, five years after those attacks took place, the investigations have still not produced any results. For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 98–108 above), the respondent State cannot be considered to have conducted an effective criminal investigation as required by Article 13, the requirements of which are stricter still than the investigatory obligation under Article 2 (see the Kaya judgment cited above, pp. 330–31, § 107 – see paragraphs 98, 112 and 114 above).', 'Consequently, there has been a violation of Article 13.', 'v. alleged practice by the authorities of infringing articles 2 and 13 of the convention', '116. Referring in particular to the Susurluk report, the applicant maintained that there existed in Turkey an officially tolerated practice of violating Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that had aggravated the breaches of which he and his uncle had been victims. In south-east Turkey, criminal proceedings were bound to fail and were incapable of preventing unlawful acts and abuse of power by the authorities. By systematically denying any breaches of the Convention, the authorities were safe from any proceedings brought against them.', '117. The Court considers that the material on the file is not sufficient to enable it to determine whether the authorities have adopted a practice of violating any of the Articles relied on by the applicant.', 'VI. alleged violation of articles 10, 14 and 18 of the convention', '118. Relying on Article 10 of the Convention, the applicant submitted that the attacks on him and his uncle constituted an aggravated violation of their right to freedom of expression, since they had been carried out because they sold the Özgür Gündem and were part of a campaign of violence tolerated by the State. He also said that both in his and his uncle’s cases there had been a violation of Article 14, taken together with Articles 2, 10 and 13, through discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin and political opinion. Lastly, the applicant complained of a violation of Article 18 in that the facts of the case revealed clear abuses of power by the State.', '119. The Government contested the applicant’s arguments. The Commission concluded that there had been no violation of Article 10 and considered that the complaints made under Articles 14 and 18 were unfounded.', '120. The Court notes that those complaints arise out of the same facts as those considered under Articles 2 and 13. In the light of its conclusion with respect to those Articles (see paragraphs 107 and 115 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to examine those complaints separately.', 'vii. application of article 50 of the convention', '121. The applicant sought just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'The Government contested the applicant’s claims in several respects. The Delegate of the Commission had no specific comments.', 'A. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage', '122. The applicant requested the Court to award him 54,000 Deutschmarks (DEM) in total, by way of pecuniary damage: DEM 4,000 for his treatment in hospital and DEM 50,000 for loss of earnings following the attack on him. He also claimed on behalf of Haşim Yaşa’s family a sum of DEM 50,000 for loss of earnings and costs entailed by his death.', 'The applicant claimed a total sum of 150,000 pounds sterling (GBP) for non-pecuniary damage, which he justified as follows:', '(i) GBP 70,000 for himself as damages for the attack (GBP 50,000), the failure to protect his right to life (GBP 10,000) and the failure to provide an effective remedy (GBP 10,000);', '(ii) GBP 70,000 for the family of the deceased in respect of the latter’s murder (GBP 50,000), the failure to protect his right to life (GBP 10,000) and the failure to provide him an effective remedy (GBP 10,000);', '(iii) GBP 10,000 for himself and for the deceased as victims of a practice of violations of Article 13 of the Convention.', '123. As their main submission, the Government maintained that no redress was necessary in the present case. In the alternative, they invited the Court to dismiss the claims for compensation made by the applicant as being exorbitant and unjustified. As regards the non-pecuniary damage, the Government firstly argued that the claims should not have been split up. They also submitted that there was no causal link between the complaints and the alleged damage. The Government firmly opposed the deceased’s family being awarded compensation on the ground that it had not taken part in the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions.', 'More generally, the Government maintained that the sums sought had been put forward without regard to the social conditions in south-east Turkey, or to the minimum wage levels in force in the country. On that point, they said that compensation for non-pecuniary damage should not constitute a source of enrichment.', '124. The Court observes that it has not been established that the applicant was attacked or his uncle killed by members of the security forces (see paragraph 97 above). It cannot therefore accede to the claims made in that connection for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. Secondly, as it has not been established either that there has been a practice of violations of the Convention (see paragraph 117 above), no compensation can be paid under that head.', 'Like the Government, the Court observes further that the application was lodged by Mr Haşim Yaşa’s nephew only (see paragraph 63 above).', 'In these circumstances, the Court considers that only Mr Eşref Yaşa is entitled to just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention (see paragraphs 107 and 115 above). Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court decides to award the applicant the sum of GBP 6,000, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '125. The applicant claimed GBP 16,426.42 in reimbursement of the costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and presentation of his case before the Convention institutions. In his schedule of costs, he set out his claim as follows, after deducting the sums received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe:', '(i) fees of the British representatives GBP 13,190.70', '(ii) fees of the Turkish advisers GBP 725.00', '(iii) various administrative expenses GBP 985.72', '(iv) administrative costs incurred in Turkey GBP 250.00', '(v) interpretation and translation costs GBP 1,440.00', 'The applicant’s counsel requested that any sums awarded in respect of costs and expenses be paid to their bank account in the United Kingdom.', '126. The Government opposed reimbursing the costs incurred by the fact that foreign lawyers had been instructed, as the sole result had been that the costs of the case had been inflated. In addition, the amount claimed for costs and expenses was excessive and not supported by documentary evidence.', '127. The Court reiterates that, as applicants are free to select legal representatives of their choice, Mr Yaşa’s recourse to United Kingdom-based lawyers specialising in the international protection of human rights cannot be criticised (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1212, § 179). The Court, deciding on an equitable basis and having regard to the details of the claims submitted by the applicant, awards him the sum of GBP 12,000 together with any value ‑ added tax that may be chargeable, less the 8,045 French francs which the applicant has received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe in respect of the fees and expenses claimed.', 'C. Default interest', '128. The Court considers it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment, namely 7.5% per annum.']",3,tr,001-58238,0

First applicant', '6. The first applicant, Ms Helen Steel, was born in 1965 and lives in London.', '7. On 22 August 1992, together with approximately sixty others, she took part in a protest against a grouse shoot on Wheeldale Moor, Yorkshire. During the morning, the protesters attempted to obstruct and distract those taking part in the shoot. At midday the shooting party broke for lunch and did not recommence until approximately 1.45 p.m., when the police arrived and an officer began warning the protesters, through a public address system, to stop their behaviour. The protesters ignored this request and the police made a total of thirteen arrests.', '8. Ms Steel was arrested by a police officer at approximately 2 p.m. for “breach of the peace” (see paragraphs 25–29 below). According to the police she was intentionally impeding the progress of a member of the shoot by walking in front of him as he lifted his shotgun to take aim, thus preventing him from firing.', '9. She was taken to a police vehicle where she was detained until about 3.15 p.m., when she was transferred to a prison van. At approximately 7.15 p.m. she was taken to Whitby police station. Upon review, her continued detention there was authorised at 11 p.m. “to prevent any further breach of the peace” and subsequently, at 6.25 a.m. on 23 August, “in order to place her before the court later [that] morning”. In total she was detained for approximately forty-four hours.', '10. At 12.56 a.m. on 23 August 1992 she was cautioned and charged. The charge-sheet stated:', '“That you did on Saturday 22 August 1992 at Wheeldale Beck in the Parish of Sefton behaved [ sic ] in a manner whereby a breach of the peace was occasioned. The complaint of PC 676 Dougall of North Yorkshire Police who applies for an order requiring that you enter into a recognizance with or without sureties to keep the peace. Pursuant to section 115 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 [“the 1980 Act” – see paragraphs 32–33 below].”', 'At 9.40 a.m. on 24 August 1992, she was further charged with using “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress”, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 (“the 1986 Act” – see paragraph 30 below).', '11. She attended court on the morning of 24 August 1992 and was released on conditional bail, the condition being that she was not to attend any game shoot in North Yorkshire during the period of remand.', '12. Ms Steel’s trial took place before the Whitby Magistrates’ Court between 15 and 20 February 1993. She was acquitted on the section 5 charge relating to the morning of 22 August 1992, and convicted on the section 5 charge relating to the afternoon of the same day. The magistrates found the complaint regarding the alleged breach of the peace proved but did not specify what behaviour of the applicant justified this conclusion or whether the complaint related to the morning or the afternoon.', '13. Ms Steel appealed. Her appeal was heard by way of rehearing on 1 December 1993 by the Teesside Crown Court, which upheld the magistrates’ findings, imposed a fine of 70 pounds sterling (GBP) for the section 5 offence, and, in respect of the breach of the peace, ordered the applicant to agree to be bound over for twelve months in the sum of GBP 100 (see paragraph 31 below).', 'Ms Steel refused to be bound over, and was committed to prison for twenty-eight days.', 'B. Second applicant', '14. The second applicant, Ms Rebecca Lush, was born in 1973 and lives in Warsash, Hampshire.', '15. On 15 September 1993, she took part in a protest against the building of an extension to the M11 motorway in Wanstead, London. During the course of that day a group of twenty to twenty-five protesters repeatedly broke into a construction site, where they climbed into trees which were to be felled and onto some of the stationary machinery. On each occasion they were removed by security guards. The protesters did not offer any resistance and there were no incidents of violence or damage to machinery.', '16. Ms Lush was arrested at approximately 4.15 p.m. while standing under the “bucket” of a “JCB” digger, for conduct “likely to provoke a disturbance of the peace”. She was taken to Ilford police station where she was charged at 5.30 p.m. The charge-sheet states:', '“Arrested as a person whose conduct on 15 September 1993 at Cambridge Park, Wanstead, was likely to provoke a disturbance of the peace to be brought before a Justice of the Peace or Magistrate to be dealt with according to law.”', 'She was kept in custody until 9.40 a.m. the following day (approximately seventeen hours’ detention), on the grounds that if released she would cause a further breach of the peace.', '17. She appeared before Redbridge Magistrates’ Court on the morning of 16 September 1993 to answer an allegation that she had engaged in conduct likely to provoke a disturbance of the peace. The proceedings were adjourned and she was released.', '18. The proceedings resumed on 14 December 1993, when the allegation of conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace, brought under section 115 of the 1980 Act, was found to have been made out. Ms Lush was ordered to agree to be bound over for twelve months to keep the peace and be of good behaviour in the sum of GBP 100. She refused to be bound over and was committed to prison for seven days.', '19. On 23 December 1993 Ms Lush requested the magistrates to state a case to the High Court (see paragraph 36 below). The magistrates replied on 24 December that under section 114 of the 1980 Act they would require a recognizance of GBP 500 that the applicant would prosecute the appeal without delay, submit to judgment and pay any costs ordered by the High Court. After correspondence between Ms Lush’s representatives and the clerk of the court concerning the applicant’s means, the magistrates agreed to reduce the recognizance to GBP 400. However, Ms Lush was unable to continue with the appeal since her application for legal aid was refused.', 'C. Third, fourth and fifth applicants', '20. Ms Andrea Needham, born in 1965, Mr David Polden, born in 1940, and Mr Christopher Cole, born in 1963, all live in London.', '21. On 20 January 1994, at approximately 8 a.m., they attended the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in Westminster, London, where the “Fighter Helicopter II” Conference was being held, in order to protest with three others against the sale of fighter helicopters. The protest took the form of handing out leaflets and holding up banners saying: “Work for Peace and not War.”', '22. At approximately 8.25 a.m. the three applicants were arrested by police officers. Ms Needham was holding a banner and Mr Polden and Mr Cole were distributing leaflets. All three applicants were taken to Charing Cross police station where the custody record for each states the “circumstances” (the word “charges” having been deleted) as:', '“Breach of the peace, common law.', 'On 20 January 1994 at Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre, Victoria Street, London SW1, constituted or was likely to provoke a disturbance of the peace to be brought before a Justice of the Peace to be dealt with according to law.', 'Contrary to common law.”', '23. At approximately 10.40 a.m. the applicants were taken to Bow Street Magistrates’ Court where they were detained in a cell. They were brought before the magistrates at 3.45 p.m., having been detained for approximately seven hours. The magistrates adjourned the matters due to lack of time and the applicants were released.', '24. On 25 February 1994, when the proceedings were resumed, the prosecution decided not to call any evidence and the magistrates dismissed the case against the applicants.']","['ii. relevant domestic law and practice', 'A. Breach of the peace', '1. Definition', '25. Breach of the peace – which does not constitute a criminal offence ( R. v. County Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ex parte Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1948] 1 King’s Bench Reports 260) – is a common-law concept dating back to the tenth century. However, as Lord Justice Watkins, giving judgment in the Court of Appeal in the case of R. v. Howell ([1982] 1 Queen’s Bench Reports 416), remarked in January 1981:', '“A comprehensive definition of the term ‘breach of the peace’ has very rarely been formulated…” (p. 426)', 'He continued:', '“We are emboldened to say that there is likely to be a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault, an affray, a riot, unlawful assembly or other disturbance.” (p. 427)', '26. In October 1981, in a differently constituted Court of Appeal giving judgment in R. v. Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board ([1982] Queen’s Bench Reports 458), which concerned a protest against the construction of a nuclear power station, Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, defined “breach of the peace” more broadly, as follows:', '“There is a breach of the peace whenever a person who is lawfully carrying out his work is unlawfully and physically prevented by another from doing it. He is entitled by law peacefully to go on with his work on his lawful occasions. If anyone unlawfully and physically obstructs the worker – by lying down or chaining himself to a rig or the like – he is guilty of a breach of the peace.” (p. 471)', '27. In a subsequent case before the Divisional Court ( Percy v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 1382), Mr Justice Collins followed Howell, rather than ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board, in holding that there must be a risk of violence before there could be a breach of the peace. However, it was not essential that the violence be perpetrated by the defendant, as long as it was established that the natural consequence of his behaviour would be to provoke violence in others:', '“The conduct in question does not itself have to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal law. It is sufficient if its natural consequence would, if persisted in, be to provoke others to violence, and so some actual danger to the peace is established.” (p. 1392)', '28. In another case before the Divisional Court, Nicol and Selvanayagam v. Director of Public Prosecutions ([1996] Justice of the Peace Reports 155), Lord Justice Simon Brown stated:', '“… the court would surely not find a [breach of the peace] proved if any violence likely to have been provoked on the part of others would be not merely unlawful but wholly unreasonable – as of course, it would be if the defendant’s conduct was not merely lawful but such as in no material way interfered with the other’s rights. A fortiori, if the defendant was properly exercising his own basic rights, whether of assembly, demonstration or free speech.” (p. 163)', '2. Arrest for breach of the peace', '29. A person may be arrested without warrant by exercise of the common-law power of arrest, for causing a breach of the peace or where it is reasonably apprehended that he is likely to cause a breach of the peace ( Albert v. Lavin [1982] Appeal Cases 546 at 565). This power was preserved by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (sections 17(6) and 25(6)).', 'B. Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986', '30. Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 (“the 1986 Act”) creates the offence of threatening, abusive, insulting or disorderly conduct likely to harass, alarm or distress others. It is triable before magistrates and punishable by fine. It is a defence to a charge under section 5 for the accused to show that the behaviour in question was reasonable in the circumstances.', 'C. Binding over', '31. Magistrates have powers to “bind over” under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”), under common law and under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361 (“the 1361 Act”).', 'A binding over order requires the person bound over to enter into a “recognizance”, or undertaking secured by a sum of money fixed by the court, to keep the peace or be of good behaviour for a specified period of time. If he or she refuses to consent to the order, the court may commit him or her to prison, for up to six months in the case of an order made under the 1980 Act or for an unlimited period in respect of orders made under the 1361 Act or common law. If an order is made but breached within the specified time period, the person bound over forfeits the sum of the recognizance. A binding-over order is not a criminal conviction ( R. v. London Quarter Sessions, ex parte Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1940] 1 King’s Bench Reports 670).', '1. Binding over under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980', '32. Section 115 of the 1980 Act provides:', '“(1) The power of a magistrates’ court on the complaint of any person to adjudge any other person to enter into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour towards the complainant shall be exercised by order on complaint.', '(…)', '(3) If any person ordered by a magistrates’ court under subsection (1) above to enter into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour fails to comply with the order, the court may commit him to custody for a period not exceeding 6 months or until he sooner complies with the order.”', '33. The procedure under section 115 of the 1980 Act is begun by laying a formal complaint, usually by a police officer. Before the magistrates can make an order they must be satisfied, on the basis of admissible evidence, that (1) the defendant’s conduct caused a breach of the peace or was likely to cause one ( R. v. Morpeth Ward Justices, ex parte Ward [1992] 95 Criminal Appeal Reports 215); and (2) unless the order is made, there is a real risk that the defendant will cause a further breach of the peace in the future.', '34. Although a binding-over order is not a criminal conviction, these proceedings have been described as analogous to criminal proceedings. In the past it was unclear whether the court should apply the criminal or the civil standard of proof when deciding whether facts exist which warrant a binding-over order at the conclusion of the proceedings. However, in Nicol and Selvanayagam v. DPP (cited above), Lord Justice Simon Brown stated:', '“It is common ground that, although no criminal conviction results from finding such a complaint proved, the criminal standard of proof applies to the procedure.”', '2. Binding over at common law and under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361', '35. In addition to the above statutory procedure, magistrates have powers to bind over at common law and under the 1361 Act. These powers allow magistrates, at any stage in proceedings before them, to bind over any participant in the proceedings (for example, a witness, acquitted defendant or a defendant who has not yet been acquitted or convicted), if they consider that the conduct of the person concerned is such that there might be a breach of the peace or that his or her behaviour has been contra bonos mores (“conduct which has the property of being wrong rather than right in the judgment of the vast majority of contemporary fellow citizens” ( per Lord Justice Glidewell in Hughes v. Holley [1988] 86 Criminal Appeal Reports 130).', '3. Appeals', '36. An order of the magistrates to require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour can be appealed either to the High Court or the Crown Court. An appeal to the High Court is limited to questions of law, and proceeds by way of “case stated”. Before stating a case, the magistrates may, under section 114 of the 1980 Act, require the appellant to enter into a recognizance to pursue the appeal and to pay costs. An appeal to the Crown Court, under the Magistrates’ Courts (Appeals from Binding Over Orders) Act 1956, section 1, proceeds as a rehearing of all issues of fact and law.', '4. The Law Commission’s report on binding over', '37. In response to a request by the Lord Chancellor to examine binding-over powers, the Law Commission (the statutory law-reform body for England and Wales) published in February 1994 its report entitled “Binding Over”, in which it found that:', '“We are satisfied that there are substantial objections of principle to the retention of binding over to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour. These objections are, in summary, that the conduct which can be the ground for a binding-over order is too vaguely defined; that binding-over orders when made are in terms which are too vague and are therefore potentially oppressive; that the power to imprison someone if he or she refuses to consent to be bound over is anomalous; that orders which restrain a subject’s freedom can be made without the discharge of the criminal, or indeed any clearly defined, burden of proof; and that witnesses, complainants or even acquitted defendants can be bound over without adequate prior information of any charge or complaint against them.” (Law Commission Report no. 222, § 6.27)', 'The Law Commission therefore recommended abolition of the power to bind over.', 'D. Immunity of magistrates from civil proceedings', '38. Under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, a civil action, for example for false imprisonment, may lie against a magistrate in respect of any act or omission in the purported execution of his or her duty only if it can be proved that he or she acted both in bad faith and in excess of jurisdiction.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '39. In their application to the Commission (no. 24838/94) of 31 May 1994, the applicants complained, under Article 5 of the Convention, that the concept of breach of the peace and the power to bind over were not sufficiently clearly defined for their detention to be “prescribed by law”; that their detention did not fall into any of the categories set out in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention; and that, because of the immunity of magistrates from civil proceedings, they had been denied a right to compensation in breach of Article 5 § 5. They alleged that there had been violations of Article 6 § 3 (a) in that inadequate details of the accusations had been provided to the first and second applicants, and of Article 6 § 2 in that breach of the peace did not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. They also complained of violations of Articles 10 and 11, arising from the uncertainty inherent in the concept of breach of the peace and the power to bind over and the disproportionality of the restrictions on their freedom to protest. Finally, the first and second applicants alleged a violation of Article 13 in connection with their refusal to be bound over.', '40. The Commission (First Chamber) declared the application admissible on 26 June 1996. In its report of 9 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been no violation of Article 5 §§ 1, 3 or 5; that there had been no violation of Article 6 §§ 1, 2 or 3; that there had been no violation of Article 10 as regarded the first and second applicants, but that there had been a violation of Article 10 as regarded the third, fourth and fifth applicants; that it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint under Article 11; and that there had been no violation of Article 13.', 'The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '41. In their memorial and at the hearing, the Government asked the Court to find that there had been no violation of the Convention in this case.', 'The applicants asked the Court to find violations of Articles 5 §§ 1 and 5, 6 § 3 (a), 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention, and to award them just satisfaction under Article 50.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'i. scope of the case before the court', '42. Before the Commission the applicants raised a number of complaints under Articles 5 § 3, 6 § 2 and 6 § 3 (b) and (c) of the Convention (see paragraph 39 above).', '43. These complaints were not pursued before the Court, which sees no reason to consider them of its own motion (see, for example, the Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 680, § 52).', 'ii. alleged violation of article 5 § 1 of the convention', '44. The applicants alleged that all their arrests and initial periods in police detention, and the later detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over, violated Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, which states (as relevant):', '“Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:', '(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;', '(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non ‑ compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;', '(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;', '…”', '45. The Court must consider whether the deprivations of liberty suffered by the applicants fell within one of the exceptions permitted under Article 5 § 1 and were “lawful”, including whether they complied with “a procedure prescribed by law”. In this connection, it will examine, first, the arrests and pre-trial detention of each applicant and, secondly, the detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over.', 'A. Arrests and initial detention of each applicant', '1. Ground of detention under Article 5 § 1', '46. It was not disputed before the Court that breach of the peace amounted to a “criminal offence” for the purposes of the Convention, and that the applicants’ arrests and detention before being brought to the magistrates’ courts fell within the scope of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1.', 'Further or in the alternative, the Government submitted that these initial periods of detention had been permissible under Article 5 § 1 (b), since the obligation to keep the peace was specific and prescribed by law.', '47. The Court recalls that each applicant was arrested for acting in a manner which allegedly caused or was likely to cause a breach of the peace and detained until he or she could be brought before a magistrates’ court.', '48. Breach of the peace is not classed as a criminal offence under English law (see paragraph 25 above). However, the Court observes that the duty to keep the peace is in the nature of a public duty; the police have powers to arrest any person who has breached the peace or who they reasonably fear will breach the peace; and the magistrates may commit to prison any person who refuses to be bound over not to breach the peace where there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that his or her conduct caused or was likely to cause a breach of the peace and that he or she would otherwise cause a breach of the peace in the future (see paragraphs 33–34 above).', '49. Bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings in question and the penalty at stake, the Court considers that breach of the peace must be regarded as an “offence” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 756, § 56).', '50. The Court therefore finds that each applicant was arrested and detained with the purpose of bringing him or her before the competent legal authority on suspicion of having committed an “offence” or because it was considered necessary to prevent the commission of an “offence”.', 'It will consider whether this suspicion was “reasonable” below, in connection with the issue of lawfulness (see paragraphs 58–64).', '2. Lawfulness of the arrests and initial detention', '51. The Government submitted that the applicants’ arrests and initial detention complied with a well-established common-law power of arrest in respect of actual or reasonably apprehended breaches of the peace which had been preserved by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraph 29 above). The conditions in which this power of arrest might be exercised had been clarified by the national courts in the cases of Howell, Percy and Nicol (see paragraphs 25–28 above) with the result that the law was sufficiently certain and precise.', 'At the hearing before the Court, in respect of the detention of the third, fourth and fifth applicants, the Government pointed out that if the police officers’ belief that these applicants’ actions had been likely to cause a breach of the peace had lacked objective justification, it would have been open to the applicants to challenge the legality of their arrests in the domestic courts. Since they had failed to take such proceedings, it had to be presumed that their arrests had been objectively justified.', '52. The applicants contended that their arrests and initial periods of detention had not been “lawful”, since the concept of breach of the peace and the attendant powers of arrest were insufficiently certain under English law.', 'First, they submitted that if, as appeared from the national case-law (see paragraph 27 above), an individual committed a breach of the peace when he or she behaved in a manner the natural consequence of which was that others would react violently, it was difficult to judge the extent to which one could engage in protest activity, in the presence of those who might be annoyed, without causing a breach of the peace. Secondly, the power to arrest whenever there were reasonable grounds for apprehending that a breach of the peace was about to take place granted too wide a discretion to the police. Thirdly, there had been conflicting decisions at Court of Appeal level as to the definition of breach of the peace (see paragraphs 25–26 above).', '53. The Commission found that there had been no violation of Article 5 § 1 since the arrests and initial detention had not been arbitrary and there had been no suggestion of any lack of conformity with domestic law.', '54. The Court recalls that the expressions “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” in Article 5 § 1 stipulate not only full compliance with the procedural and substantive rules of national law, but also that any deprivation of liberty be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 and not arbitrary (see the above-mentioned Benham judgment, pp. 752–53, § 40). In addition, given the importance of personal liberty, it is essential that the applicable national law meet the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, which requires that all law, whether written or unwritten, be sufficiently precise to allow the citizen – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see the S.W. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-B, pp. 41–42, §§ 35–36, and, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49, and the Halford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 1017, § 49).', '55. In this connection, the Court observes that the concept of breach of the peace has been clarified by the English courts over the last two decades, to the extent that it is now sufficiently established that a breach of the peace is committed only when an individual causes harm, or appears likely to cause harm, to persons or property or acts in a manner the natural consequence of which would be to provoke others to violence (see paragraphs 25–28 above). It is also clear that a person may be arrested for causing a breach of the peace or where it is reasonably apprehended that he or she is likely to cause a breach of the peace (see paragraph 29 above).', 'Accordingly, the Court considers that the relevant legal rules provided sufficient guidance and were formulated with the degree of precision required by the Convention (see, for example, the Larissis and Others v. Greece judgment of 24 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 377, § 34).', '56. When considering whether the arrest and detention of each applicant was carried out in accordance with English law, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 5 § 1, the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter (see the above-mentioned Benham judgment, p. 753, § 41).', '57. The Court has already noted that under English law there is a power to arrest an individual for causing a breach of the peace or where it is reasonably apprehended that he is likely to cause a breach of the peace. It will therefore examine the circumstances of each applicant’s arrest to determine whether one of these criteria applied.', '(a) First and second applicants', '58. The Court recalls that the first applicant was arrested during a protest at a grouse shoot. During the morning, protesters had taken steps to disrupt the shoot. In the early afternoon, Ms Steel was arrested as she walked in front of a person who was armed with a gun, thus preventing him from firing (see paragraphs 7–8 above).', '59. The second applicant was arrested while she stood under the bucket of a mechanical digger, towards the end of a day during which twenty to twenty-five protesters had repeatedly obstructed the work of road-builders (see paragraphs 15–16 above).', '60. The Court notes that the national courts that dealt with these cases were satisfied that each applicant had caused or had been likely to cause a breach of the peace (see paragraphs 12–13, 18 and 33 above).', 'The Court, having itself examined the evidence before it, finds no reason to doubt that the police were justified in fearing that these applicants’ behaviour, if persisted in, might provoke others to violence. It follows that the arrests and initial detention of the first and second applicants complied with English law. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that these deprivations of liberty were arbitrary.', '61. In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 in respect of the arrests and initial detention of the first and second applicants.', '(b) Third, fourth and fifth applicants', '62. Turning to Ms Needham, Mr Polden and Mr Cole, the Court recalls that they were arrested outside a conference centre where they had been handing out leaflets and holding up banners protesting at the sale of weapons. They were subsequently detained for approximately seven hours before being released on bail (see paragraphs 21–22 above).', '63. The Court notes that there is no ruling of a national court on the question whether the arrests and detention of these applicants accorded with English law, since the prosecution decided to withdraw the allegations of breach of the peace from the magistrates (see paragraph 24 above) and since the applicants did not bring any civil claim for false imprisonment against the police. It observes that the Government have not raised any preliminary objection in respect of this omission by the applicants, and, in the absence of such a plea, it is not necessary for the Court to consider whether the complaint should have been declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, p. 28, § 56, and the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 23, § 46).', '64. Having itself considered the evidence available to it relating to the arrests of these three applicants, the Court sees no reason to regard their protest as other than entirely peaceful. It does not find any indication that they significantly obstructed or attempted to obstruct those attending the conference, or took any other action likely to provoke these others to violence. Indeed, it would not appear that there was anything in their behaviour which could have justified the police in fearing that a breach of the peace was likely to be caused.', 'For this reason, in the absence of any national decision on the question, the Court is not satisfied that their arrests and subsequent detention for seven hours complied with English law so as to be “lawful” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1.', '65. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 in respect of the third, fourth and fifth applicants.', 'B. Detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over', '1. Categorisation under Article 5 § 1', '66. The Government contended that the detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over fell within the scope of Article 5 § 1 (a), since an order to be bound over, requiring a finding by a court that the accused had committed a breach of the peace, was analogous to a criminal conviction. Further or in the alternative, the detention fell under Article 5 § 1 (b), since the applicants were committed to prison as a result of their refusal to comply with the orders that they enter into recognizances to keep the peace.', '67. The applicants considered that the power to bind over to keep the peace operated in the nature of a criminal sanction. However, they disputed that the detention of Ms Steel and Ms Lush for refusing to be bound over could be justified under Article 5 § 1 (b) since, in their submission, a requirement in general terms “to keep the peace” was not sufficiently concrete and specific to amount to an “obligation prescribed by law”.', '68. The Commission found that, although it could be said that the first and second applicants had been “convict[ed] by a competent court”, Article 5 § 1 (a) required a causal connection between conviction and detention which, arguably, had been broken in the present cases, since it was not the magistrates’ finding that the applicants had committed breaches of the peace which led to their detention, but rather their refusal to enter into recognizances. In any case, the detention was in accordance with Article 5 § 1 (b).', '69. The Court recalls that, in proceedings under section 115 of the 1980 Act (see paragraphs 10 and 32 above), the first applicant was ordered by the Teesside Crown Court to agree to be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of twelve months, subject to a recognizance of GBP 100. When she refused to agree to the terms of this order, she was committed to prison for twenty-eight days (see paragraph 13 above).', 'The second applicant was similarly ordered by the Redbridge Magistrates’ Court to agree to be bound over under section 115 of the 1980 Act to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for twelve months in the sum of GBP 100. When she refused to observe this order, she was committed to prison for seven days (see paragraph 18 above).', '70. In the Court’s view, both applicants were, therefore, detained for non-compliance with the order of a court, as is permitted by Article 5 § 1 (b).', 'It will consider in connection with the issue of “lawfulness” (see paragraphs 74–78 below) whether the terms of the binding-over orders applied to these applicants were sufficiently clearly defined for the purposes of Article 5 § 1.', '2. Lawfulness of the applicants’ detention for refusing to be bound over', '71. The Government submitted that it was clear from national case-law that an order to be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour required the person bound over to avoid conduct involving violence or the threat of violence or unreasonably giving rise to a situation where there was a real risk that violence might occur. The magistrates had acted within the law in committing Ms Steel and Ms Lush to prison for refusing to be bound over.', '72. The applicants argued that it was unclear, first, what conduct could trigger an order to be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and, secondly, what conduct would amount to a breach of such an order; the expression contra bonos mores in particular was very vague (see paragraph 35 above). In addition, there was no limit to the possible duration of an order, the amount of the recognizance or, under the common law, the length of detention following refusal to enter into an order.', '73. The Commission found that the detention was lawful under English law and, since the applicants could have avoided it by agreeing to be bound over, was not arbitrary.', '74. The Court will examine the applicants’ detention and the binding-over orders with reference to the requirements of “lawfulness” under Article 5 § 1 (see paragraph 54 above).', '75. It will first consider whether the national law was formulated with sufficient precision reasonably to allow the applicants to foresee the consequences of their actions.', 'In this connection, it recalls its finding (in paragraph 55 above) that the elements of breach of the peace were adequately defined by English law. Furthermore, it is clear, from the terms of section 115 of the 1980 Act and the relevant case-law (see paragraphs 31–33 above) that where magistrates are satisfied, on the basis of admissible evidence, that an individual has committed a breach of the peace and that there is a real risk that he or she will do so again, the accused may be required to enter into recognizances to keep the peace or be of good behaviour. Finally, it is also clear that, if the accused refuses to comply with such an order, he or she may be committed to prison for up to six months (ibid.).', 'The Court is, therefore, satisfied that the applicants could reasonably have foreseen that, if they acted in a manner the natural consequence of which would be to provoke others to violence, they might be ordered to be bound over to keep the peace, and if they refused so to be bound over, they might be committed to prison.', '76. The Court will also examine whether the binding-over orders applied to the applicants were specific enough properly to be described as “lawful order[s] of a court”.', 'In this respect it notes that the orders were expressed in rather vague and general terms; the expression “to be of good behaviour” was particularly imprecise and offered little guidance to the person bound over as to the type of conduct which would amount to a breach of the order. However, in each applicant’s case the binding-over order was imposed after a finding that she had committed a breach of the peace. Having considered all the circumstances, the Court is satisfied that, given the context, it was sufficiently clear that the applicants were being requested to agree to refrain from causing further, similar, breaches of the peace during the ensuing twelve months.', '77. Finally, the Court observes that there is no evidence to suggest that the magistrates acted outside their jurisdiction or that the binding-over orders or the applicants’ subsequent detention failed to comply with English law for any other reason.', '78. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 in respect of the detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over.', 'iii. alleged violation of article 5 § 5 OF THE CONVENTION', '79. All the applicants complained that under English law there was no right to compensation in respect of arrests and detention which violated the Convention but were in accordance with national law, whereas Article 5 § 5 of the Convention provides:', '“Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”', '80. The Government submitted that there had been no breach of Article 5 § 1, and that Article 5 § 5 was thus inapplicable.', 'In the alternative, they pointed out that if the applicants’ arrests or detention had been contrary to English law, they could have brought civil proceedings against the police for false imprisonment.', '81. The Court recalls that Article 5 § 5 guarantees an enforceable right to compensation to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention in contravention of the other provisions of Article 5 (see the above-mentioned Benham judgment, p. 755, § 50).', '82. In view of the Court’s finding that there was no violation of Article 5 § 1 in respect of the first and second applicants, it concludes that Article 5 § 5 is not applicable in those cases.', '83. The Court has found that Article 5 § 1 was violated in respect of the third, fourth and fifth applicants, because it is not satisfied that their arrests and ensuing detention complied with domestic law. However, it notes in this respect that it would have been open to these applicants to bring civil actions for damages against the police (see paragraph 63 above). It therefore considers that these applicants had at their disposal “an enforceable right to compensation” and that Article 5 § 5 was accordingly not violated in this case.', 'iv. alleged violation of article 6 § 3 (a ) of the convention', '84. The first and second applicants complained that they had not been provided with sufficient details of the charges against them, in violation of Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention, which states:', '“Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:', '(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;', '…”', 'They argued that, since “breach of the peace” was a very general accusation, the precise behaviour of each applicant which formed the basis of the charge should have been specified.', '85. The Government pointed out that within ten hours of her arrest the first applicant had been given a charge-sheet which informed her that she was charged with causing a breach of the peace contrary to section 115 of the 1980 Act on a stated date and in a stated place (see paragraph 10 above). The second applicant had been provided with similar information one and a quarter hours after her arrest (see paragraph 16 above). In the Government’s submission, with which the Commission agreed, this was sufficient to comply with Article 6 § 3 (a).', '86. The Court recalls its above finding (paragraph 49) that breach of the peace should be regarded as an “offence” for the purposes of the Convention. Article 6 § 3 (a) is thus applicable.', '87. The Court, like the Commission, considers that the details contained in the charge-sheets given to the first and second applicants (see paragraphs 10 and 16 above) were sufficient to comply with this Article (see the Brozicek v. Italy judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 167, pp. 18–19, § 42).', 'It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 3 (a).', 'V. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '88. All the applicants complained that the measures taken against them violated their rights to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, which states:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers…', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '89. The Court must determine whether the impugned measures amounted to interferences with the applicants’ rights to freedom of expression and, if so, whether they were “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and were “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2.', 'A. Interference', '90. The Government submitted that the protest activity of the first and second applicants was not peaceful, and that Article 10 was not, therefore, applicable.', '91. The Commission found that the measures taken against each of the five applicants amounted to interferences with their rights under Article 10.', '92. The Court recalls that the first and second applicants were arrested while protesting against a grouse shoot and the extension of a motorway respectively (see paragraphs 7 and 15–16 above). It is true that these protests took the form of physically impeding the activities of which the applicants disapproved, but the Court considers nonetheless that they constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10 (see, for example, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, § 23). The measures taken against the applicants were, therefore, interferences with their right to freedom of expression.', '93. With regard to the third, fourth and fifth applicants, it has not been disputed that their arrests and detention constituted interferences with their Article 10 rights.', 'B. “Prescribed by law”', '94. The Court recalls its above findings (paragraphs 61, 78 and 65) that the measures taken against the first and second applicants were lawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1, but that those taken against the third, fourth and fifth applicants were not.', 'Since the requirement under Article 10 § 2 that an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression be “prescribed by law” is similar to that under Article 5 § 1 that any deprivation of liberty be “lawful” (see paragraph 54 above), it follows that the arrests and detention of the first and second applicants were “prescribed by law” under Article 10 § 2 but that those of the third, fourth and fifth applicants were not (see paragraph 64 above).', 'C. Legitimate aim', '95. It was not disputed before the Court that the impugned measures pursued one or more of the legitimate aims listed in Article 10 § 2.', '96. The Court considers that each applicant’s arrest and initial detention pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and protecting the rights of others.', '97. The position with regard to the detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over is somewhat different. Here the Court considers that the purpose in binding over the applicants was to deter them from causing future breaches of the peace. Thus the binding ‑ over orders themselves pursued the aims of preventing disorder and protecting the rights of others. However, in refusing to comply with these orders, the applicants were, to a certain extent, challenging the authority of the courts which imposed them. Their subsequent committal to prison, therefore, was intended not only to deter future breaches of the peace, but also pursued the aim under Article 10 § 2 of maintaining the authority of the judiciary.', 'D. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '98. The Government contended that the measures taken against the applicants fell within the margin of appreciation allowed to the national authorities and were proportionate to the aims pursued, particularly in view of the fact that the police had been called upon to make decisions in difficult circumstances to preserve public order. The applicants were initially detained only until they could be brought before the magistrates, which occurred in each case on the first working day following the arrest. This detention prevented them from returning to the scene of the protest and committing further breaches of the peace. Finally, the detention of the first and second applicants following their refusal to be bound over was also proportionate, given that each had had the option instead to comply with lawful, and more lenient, court orders.', '99. The applicants maintained that the measures taken against them were disproportionate.', 'First, they stated that, in the context of non-violent protest activity, arrest was too extreme a measure since it totally extinguished the possibility further to participate in the demonstration and since the threat of arrest had a “chilling” effect on the exercise of Article 10 rights. Secondly, they pointed out that they had each been detained for long periods of time when other less restrictive measures could have been used.', 'Finally, the first and second applicants argued that their freedom to protest would have been unreasonably restricted had they agreed to the vague and general terms of the binding-over orders and that they had been imprisoned for long periods of time as a result of their refusal to accept these restrictions.', '100. The Commission found that, in all the circumstances, the measures taken against the first and second applicants had not been disproportionate, whereas those taken against the third, fourth and fifth applicants had violated Article 10.', '101. As the Court has often observed, freedom of expression constitutes an essential foundation of democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment (see, most recently, the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ IV, p. 1566, § 46). It is true that States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent any interference with the exercise of freedom of expression is necessary, particularly as regards the choice of reasonable and appropriate means to be used to ensure that lawful activities can take place peacefully (see the above-mentioned Chorherr judgment, p. 37, § 31). However, this margin goes hand in hand with supervision by the Court, which must ascertain that any such interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, due regard being had to the importance of freedom of expression (ibid.).', 'Since different factors are relevant to each of the applicants, the Court will examine each case separately.', '1. First applicant', '102. The Court recalls that, as part of a protest against a grouse shoot, the first applicant walked in front of an armed member of the shoot, thus physically preventing him from firing. She was arrested and detained for approximately forty-four hours prior to being brought before a magistrates’ court and then released. At the subsequent hearing, she was fined GBP 70 in respect of an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 and, in respect of the breach of the peace, she was ordered to agree to be bound over for twelve months in the sum of GBP 100. When she refused, she was imprisoned for twenty-eight days.', '103. The Court has no doubt that the measures taken against Ms Steel, particularly the long periods of detention, amounted to serious interferences with the exercise of her right to freedom of expression. However, it must also have regard to the dangers inherent in the applicant’s particular form of protest activity and the risk of disorder arising from the persistent obstruction by the demonstrators of the members of the grouse shoot as they attempted to carry out their lawful pastime.', '104. In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the actions of the police in arresting Ms Steel and removing her from the scene of the demonstration were disproportionate.', '105. She was then held for approximately forty-four hours. From the custody record it would appear that the police considered this necessary to prevent any further breach of the peace and to ensure that she attended before the magistrates (see paragraph 9 above).', 'Forty-four hours is undoubtedly a long period of detention in such a case. However, the Court recalls that Ms Steel’s behaviour prior to her arrest had created a danger of serious physical injury to herself and others and had formed part of a protest against grouse shooting which risked culminating in disorder and violence. Particularly given the risk of an early resumption by her, if released, of her protest activities against field sports, and the possible consequences of this eventuality, both of which the police were best placed to assess, the Court does not consider that this detention was disproportionate.', '106. The Court must also have regard to the measures applied to the applicant after her trial and appeal (see paragraphs 12–13 above).', 'It recalls its above finding that, in ordering Ms Steel to be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, the court was effectively requesting her to agree to refrain for a year from causing any further breach of the peace (see paragraph 76 above). Again, given the dangers inherent in her chosen form of protest and the public interest in deterring such conduct, the Court does not find that the imposition either of this order, or of the GBP 70 fine, was excessive in the circumstances.', '107. The applicant was imprisoned because she refused to comply with the binding-over order. The Court agrees with the Commission that it was legitimate for the national court to interpret this refusal as a statement by the applicant that, despite the court’s order, she considered her protest behaviour to have been justified and intended to continue with it in the future. In these circumstances, bearing in mind not only the aim of deterrence mentioned above, but also the importance in a democratic society of maintaining the rule of law and the authority of the judiciary (see paragraph 97 above and the above-mentioned Sunday Times (no. 1) judgment, p. 34, § 55), the Court does not find it disproportionate that the applicant was committed to prison, even for as long as twenty-eight days, for refusing to comply with the court’s order.', '2. Second applicant', '108. The second applicant had taken part in a protest against the building of a motorway extension, placing herself in front of machinery in order to impede the engineering works. She was arrested and detained for approximately seventeen hours prior to being brought before a magistrates’ court, and was subsequently imprisoned for seven days after refusing to agree to be bound over (see paragraphs 15–18 above).', '109. The Court refers to its reasoning and findings in relation to the first applicant (paragraphs 103–07 above). Although the risk of disorder created by Ms Lush’s conduct was, arguably, less serious than that caused by the first applicant, the magistrates nonetheless found that she had acted in a way likely to cause a breach of the peace and the Court sees no reason to doubt this conclusion (see paragraph 60 above). Taking into account the interest in maintaining public order and protecting the rights of others, and also the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary, the measures taken against the second applicant were not disproportionate.', '3. Third, fourth and fifth applicants', '110. The Court recalls its above finding that the measures taken against Ms Needham, Mr Polden and Mr Cole were not “lawful” or “prescribed by law”, since it is not satisfied that the police had grounds reasonably to apprehend that the applicants’ peaceful protest would cause a breach of the peace (see paragraph 94 above). For similar reasons, as developed in paragraph 64 above, it considers that the interference with the exercise by the applicants of their right to freedom of expression was also disproportionate to the aims of preventing disorder and protecting the rights of others, and was not, therefore, “necessary in a democratic society”.', '4. Conclusion', '111. In conclusion, the measures taken against the first and second applicants did not give rise to any violation of Article 10, while those taken against the third, fourth and fifth applicants did.', 'vi. alleged violation of article 11 of the convention', '112. The applicants complained that the impugned measures also violated Article 11 of the Convention, which states:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.”', '113. The Court does not find that this complaint raises any issues not already examined in the context of Article 10. For this reason it is unnecessary to consider it.', 'vii. alleged violation of article 13 of the convention', '114. The first and second applicants alleged that there had been a breach of Article 13 of the Convention, which states:', '“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”', '115. The Commission, in its report, had concluded that the applicants’ complaints under Article 13 “relate[d] essentially to the state of United Kingdom law”, and found no violation since Article 13 could not be interpreted as guaranteeing a remedy against, or judicial review of, domestic law which was not considered to be in conformity with the Convention.', '116. However, except for a bare statement in their memorial that “the first and second applicants claim a violation of Article 13 … in relation to their lack of remedies in connection with their detention for refusing to be bound over”, the applicants did not submit any argumentation in respect of this complaint to the Court.', '117. In these circumstances, where the complaint does not appear to have been pursued, the Court does not consider it necessary to consider it of its own motion.', 'VIii. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION', '118. The applicants claimed just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', '119. The Court recalls that it has found breaches of the Convention in respect only of the third, fourth and fifth applicants. It will not, therefore, consider the first and second applicants’ claims for just satisfaction.', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '120. The applicants claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage.', '121. The Government contended that a finding of violation would provide adequate just satisfaction.', '122. The Court recalls that Ms Needham, Mr Polden and Mr Cole were each imprisoned for seven hours following the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression. It awards them GBP 500 each in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '123. The total costs and expenses claimed in respect of all five applicants were GBP 53,889.62 (inclusive of value-added tax “VAT”).', '124. The Government submitted that, in the event that the Court upheld only part of the applicants’ complaints, only part of their claim for costs should be awarded. They also questioned whether it had been necessary to employ three counsel on such a case.', '125. In view of the fact that it has found violations in respect of only part of the last three applicants’ complaints, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards in respect of costs and expenses GBP 20,000, together with any VAT which may be payable, but less the amounts already paid by way of legal aid by the Council of Europe.', 'C. Default interest', '126. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.']",2,gb,001-58240,1

The applicant, Ms Sally McLeod, was born in 1952 and lives in Middlesex.', 'A. Background to the case', '7. In April 1986 the applicant and her husband separated and in July 1988 they were divorced. At about that time, the applicant’s elderly mother went to live with her in the former matrimonial home, which Ms McLeod had bought with her ex-husband in 1984.', '8. Following the couple’s separation, proceedings were instigated before the Uxbridge County Court concerning the former matrimonial home and its contents. These proceedings were described by Mr Justice Tuckey in the High Court’s judgment of 12 November 1992 as substantial and acrimonious (see paragraph 18 below).', '9. On 1 July 1988 the Uxbridge County Court ordered that the former matrimonial home be transferred to the applicant on payment of 30,000 pounds sterling (GBP). Although this amount was paid by the applicant on or about 26 July 1989, the house was not transferred into her sole ownership until after the events in question. Nevertheless, in its judgment of 27 November 1992, the Brentford County Court found that on payment of the GBP 30,000 “the beneficial ownership of the property vested in her as sole owner” (see paragraph 19 below).', '10. On 30 June 1989 the Uxbridge County Court ordered the division of the furniture and other moveable property to be found in the former matrimonial home in accordance with a list identified in the order. However, delivery was not effected and on 23 August 1989 the County Court ordered Ms McLeod to make arrangements for the delivery of her ex-husband’s property within fourteen days. The order was backed by a penal notice.', '11. On 8 September 1989 the applicant delivered property to her ex-husband which, save for one or two items, was not that described in the order. As a result, on 28 September 1989 the Uxbridge County Court made an order committing her to prison for twenty-one days. However, this order was suspended for seven days to allow her to deliver the property identified on the list to Mr McLeod on or before 6 October 1989. Immediately after the hearing the latter, through his counsel, offered to collect the property to save the applicant the trouble of delivering it. He suggested 4 p.m. on 3 October 1989.', 'B. Events of 3 October 1989', '12. Believing that the applicant had agreed to his suggestion, at 4 p.m. on 3 October 1989 Mr McLeod, accompanied by his brother and sister and a solicitor’s clerk, went to the former matrimonial home to collect his property. Fearing that there would be a breach of the peace (see paragraphs 24 to 27 below) because of Ms McLeod’s previous unwillingness to comply with orders of the court, Mr McLeod’s solicitors made arrangements for two police officers to be present while the property was being removed. When the police officers arrived, they were informed that Mr McLeod was there to collect his property pursuant to an agreement concluded between him and the applicant, and were given a copy of the list but not of the court order. According to one of the police officers, the solicitor’s clerk offered to return to his office to get a copy of the order, but the police officer did not require that this be done.', '13. One of the police officers knocked at the door of the house. It was answered by the applicant’s mother who told him that her daughter was not at home, and that she was unaware of any arrangement concluded between the latter and Mr McLeod. In an affidavit sworn on 21 November 1990, the applicant’s mother claimed that the police officer had told her to open the door because they were from the court and had a court order to execute. The applicant’s mother opened the door and stepped aside, allowing Mr McLeod and his party access to the property. Subsequent court proceedings held that the entry of Mr McLeod, his siblings, and the solicitor’s clerk amounted to a trespass (see paragraph 19 below).', '14. Upon entering the house, Mr McLeod and his siblings began removing his property. Although the police officers accompanied them into the house, according to the applicant’s mother’s affidavit the officers spent most of the time on the front driveway. They did not participate in the removal or disturbance of the property, although one of them checked that only the items on the list were removed.', '15. When the applicant returned home at 5.30 p.m., she became angry and objected to the removal of the property. At that stage, one load had been driven away and a second load was in the van, which had been rented by her ex-husband. One of the police officers intervened and insisted that she allow Mr McLeod to leave with the property. She was permitted to inspect the contents of the van but the officer insisted that she should not unload items from it because he feared that, if she did so, there was likely to be a breach of the peace. He explained to Ms McLeod that any continuing dispute concerning the property should be resolved later by her and her ex-husband’s respective solicitors. Just after midnight the applicant’s mother, who had recently suffered a stroke, was taken to hospital suffering from high blood pressure.', 'C. Trespass proceedings in the High Court', '16. The applicant instituted criminal proceedings against those involved in the incident, which were unsuccessful. Together with her mother, she then instituted three sets of civil proceedings for trespass, one against her ex-husband and his siblings, one against the solicitor’s clerk and a third against the two police officers.', '17. On 26 January 1992 the applicant’s mother died.', '1. Action against the police', '18. On 12 November 1992 Mr Justice Tuckey in the High Court dismissed the action against the police officers on the grounds that they had not trespassed on the applicant’s land or goods. Although the judge considered that the applicant had not agreed to her ex-husband removing his property from the former matrimonial home on 3 October 1989, he found that the latter genuinely believed that an agreement had been concluded. Furthermore, he considered that the officers had had reasonable grounds for apprehending that a breach of the peace might take place and were therefore entitled, pursuant to the common law as preserved by statute, to enter on and remain at the property without the consent of the owner:', '“The [applicant] contends that the police did not have reasonable grounds for apprehending that there might be a breach of the peace and therefore they were trespassers on the property. I reject this contention. They had been told to go to the house on the information of a solicitor that there might be trouble. The history of the matter makes it clear in my judgment that the solicitor’s fears were well-founded. If [the applicant] had been there when her ex-husband’s party arrived, I have no doubt that the police constables’ role as peace-keepers would have been required.”', 'Regarding the applicant’s claims for trespass to goods, the judge found that the police officers had not actively participated in the removal or the disturbance of the applicant’s property. Although one of the police officers had checked that only the items on the list figuring in the court’s order were removed, “he did not encourage or participate in the removal of those things that apparently were on the list or in the way in which things in or on those items were to be dealt with”.', '2. Action against the applicant’s ex-husband and his siblings and solicitors', '19. On 27 November 1992 the Brentford County Court pronounced on the applicant’s two remaining civil actions against her ex-husband, his brother and sister and his solicitors. It considered that there had not been any agreement between Ms and Mr McLeod for him to collect his property on 3 October 1989 and that the applicant’s mother had not given permission to Mr McLeod and his party to enter the house. The court concluded that, as a result, they had trespassed on Ms McLeod’s land and property. She and her mother’s estate were awarded GBP 1,950 with interest by way of compensation.', 'D. Proceedings on appeal', '20. On 1 December 1992 the applicant appealed against the decision of Mr Justice Tuckey on the ground that the police officers should have made enquiries before entering her house, that there had been no breach of the peace or threat of a breach of the peace and that the police had been negligent in failing to give adequate protection to her mother.', '21. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 3 February 1994 ( McLeod v. Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1994] 4 All England Law Reports 553). In his judgment Lord Justice Neill held:', '“The real issue in the case, as I see it, is whether the officers had any excuse in law for entering [the former matrimonial home]. It is common ground that some excuse is required because it does not appear that there was any consent to the entry by [the applicant] or her mother. The judge found that they took no active part in removing any property and, as I have said, all [one of the police officers] did was to check a list of what was being taken. But it is clear that they both entered the property and it may be that one of them knocked on the door.', 'There are two questions which need to be decided. First, in what circumstances, if any, can police officers enter into a private house to prevent a breach of the peace? Secondly, if a right to enter a private house does exist in certain circumstances, did those circumstances exist here?”', 'Noting that the common-law powers of the police to enter private premises were preserved by section 17(6) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”), the judge considered that the principal authority under common law was the decision of the Divisional Court in Thomas v. Sawkins ([1935] King’s Bench Reports 249). Lord Justice Neill continued:', '“That was a case where police officers went to a hall where a public meeting which had been extensively advertised was about to take place; the police sergeant in charge of the party was refused admission to the hall but insisted on entering and remaining there during the meeting. The question arose as to whether the police were entitled to take that course.', 'Lord Hewart, who delivered the first judgment in the case, said this at page 254:', '‘I think that there is quite sufficient ground for the proposition that it is part of the preventive power, and, therefore, part of the preventive duty, of the police, in cases where there are such reasonable grounds of apprehension as the justices have found here, to enter and remain on private premises.’', 'At page 255 Avory J said, in relation to entering premises in connection with an affray:', '‘... I cannot doubt that he has a right to break in to prevent an affray which he has reasonable cause to suspect may take place on private premises.’', 'He considered, therefore, that the police officers were justified in what they were doing. Lawrence J at page 257 put the matter as follows:', '‘If a constable in the execution of his duty to preserve the peace is entitled to commit an assault, it appears to me that he is equally entitled to commit a trespass.’”', 'Lord Justice Neill further considered that another precedent of relevance for the applicant’s case was McGowan v. Chief Police Constable of Kingston Upon Hull (reported in The Times on 21 October 1967):', '“In that case police officers had gone into a house where a child was being held in a man’s arms. The police officers said that they had reason to think that a breach of the peace might occur between the man and his mistress. But a question arose as to whether the mistress had authority to give an invitation to the police officers to come in. The Lord Chief Justice when giving his judgment said:', '‘Regardless of the invitation, there was sufficient [ground] to justify the police entering the house on the basis that they genuinely suspected a danger of breach of the peace occurring.’”', 'Lord Justice Neill then recalled that the judgment in Thomas v. Sawkins had been subjected to criticism in that it had appeared to infringe the basic principle that the law would not intervene until an offence had actually been committed. He also noted that it had been suggested that the precedent established in Thomas v. Sawkins should be limited to public meetings, and continued:', '“Having the benefit of argument, I am satisfied that Parliament in section 17(6) [of the 1984 Act] has now recognised that there is a power to enter premises to prevent a breach of the peace as a form of preventive justice. I can see no satisfactory basis for restricting that power to particular classes of premises such as those where public meetings are held. If the police reasonably believe that a breach of the peace is likely to take place on private premises, they have power to enter those premises to prevent it. The apprehension must of course be genuine and it must relate to the near future.”', 'Mindful of the practical difficulties of using the power correctly and sensibly in domestic situations, Lord Justice Neill commented that:', '“… when exercising his power to prevent a breach of the peace a police officer should act with great care and discretion; this will be particularly important where the exercise of his power involves entering on private property contrary to the wishes of the owners or occupiers. The officer must satisfy himself that there is a real and imminent risk of a breach of the peace, because if the matter has to be tested in court thereafter there may be scrutiny not only of his belief at the time but also of the grounds for his belief.”', 'Relying on the facts as established by the High Court, Lord Justice Neill considered that the police officers entered the applicant’s house to prevent a breach of the peace and were reasonable in concluding that there was a danger of such a breach. The other judges, Lords Justices Hoffman and Waite agreed. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.', '22. On 1 March 1994 the applicant applied to the House of Lords for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision of 3 February 1994. On 18 May 1994 the House of Lords refused the application.']","['ii. relevant domestic law', 'A. Statutory powers of entry', '23. Section 17 of the 1984 Act sets out the primary circumstances in which a police constable may enter and search premises. According to section 17(1)(e), a police officer may enter any premises for the purposes of saving life or limb or preventing serious damage to property. Whilst section 17(5) abolishes all common-law rules under which a police officer previously had power to enter premises without warrant, section 17(6) provides:', '“Nothing in subsection (5) affects any power of entry to deal with or prevent a breach of the peace.”', 'B. Breach of the peace', '24. Breach of the peace – which does not constitute a criminal offence ( R. v. County Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ex parte Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1948] 1 King’s Bench Reports 260) – is a common-law concept dating back to the tenth century. However, as Lord Justice Watkins, giving judgment in the Court of Appeal in the case of R. v. Howell ([1982] 1 Queen’s Bench Reports 416) remarked in January 1981:', '“A comprehensive definition of the term ‘breach of the peace’ has very rarely been formulated…” (p. 426)', 'He continued:', '“We are emboldened to say that there is likely to be a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault, an affray, a riot, unlawful assembly or other disturbance.” (p. 427)', '25. In October 1981, in a differently constituted Court of Appeal giving judgment in R. v. Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board ([1982] Queen’s Bench Reports 458), which concerned a protest against the construction of a nuclear power station, Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, defined “breach of the peace” more broadly, as follows:', '“There is a breach of the peace whenever a person who is lawfully carrying out his work is unlawfully and physically prevented by another from doing it. He is entitled by law peacefully to go on with his work on his lawful occasions. If anyone unlawfully and physically obstructs the worker – by lying down or chaining himself to a rig or the like – he is guilty of a breach of the peace.” (p. 471)', '26. In a subsequent case before the Divisional Court ( Percy v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1995] 1 Weekly Law Reports 1382), Mr Justice Collins followed Howell, rather than ex parte Central Electricity Generating Board, in holding that there must be a risk of violence before there could be a breach of the peace. However, it was not essential that the violence be perpetrated by the defendant, as long as it was established that the natural consequence of his behaviour would be to provoke violence in others:', '“The conduct in question does not itself have to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal law. It is sufficient if its natural consequence would, if persisted in, be to provoke others to violence, and so some actual danger to the peace is established.” (p. 1392)', '27. In another case before the Divisional Court, Nicol and Selvanayagam v. Director of Public Prosecutions ([1996] Justice of the Peace Reports 155) Lord Justice Simon Brown stated:', '“… the court would surely not find a [breach of the peace] proved if any violence likely to have been provoked on the part of others would be not merely unlawful but wholly unreasonable – as of course, it would be if the defendant’s conduct was not merely lawful but such as in no material way interfered with the other’s rights. A fortiori, if the defendant was properly exercising his own basic rights, whether of assembly, demonstration or free speech.” (p. 163)', 'C. Police right of entry to prevent a breach of the peace', '28. The common-law power of the police to enter private property to prevent a breach of the peace, as preserved by section 17(6) of the 1984 Act, was defined by Lord Chief Justice Hewart in Thomas v. Sawkins cited above:', '“I think that there is quite sufficient ground for the proposition that it is part of the preventive power, and, therefore, part of the preventive duty, of the police, in cases where there are such reasonable grounds of apprehension as the justices have found here, to enter and remain on private premises. It goes without saying that the powers and duties of the police are directed, not to the interests of the police, but to the protection and welfare of the public. (p. 254)', '… I am not at all prepared to accept the doctrine that it is only where [a breach of the peace] has been, or is being, committed, that the police are entitled to enter and remain on private premises. On the contrary, it seems to me that a police officer has ex virtute officii full right so to act when he has reasonable ground for believing that [a breach of the peace] is imminent or is likely to be committed.” (p. 255)', '29. The continued existence of the common-law power of entry to prevent a breach of the peace and its applicability to circumstances of a domestic quarrel was recognised in McGowan v. Chief Constable of Kingston Upon Hull ([1968] Criminal Law Reports 34), where the Lord Chief Justice said:', '“Regardless of the invitation, there was sufficient [ground] to justify the police entering the house on the basis that they genuinely suspected a danger of breach of the peace occurring.”', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '30. In her application (no. 24755/94 ) to the Commission of 22 May 1994, Ms McLeod relied on Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, complaining that the entry of the police into her house on 3 October 1989 and the subsequent failure of the courts to grant her legal protection amounted to a violation of her right to respect for her home and private life and to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. She further alleged that there had been a violation of her right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the Convention, since the House of Lords had refused to examine her appeal. Finally, she complained that her mother’s rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention had been violated.', '31. On 26 June 1996 the Commission (First Chamber) declared admissible the complaints concerning the alleged interference with the applicant’s home, private life and enjoyment of her possessions, and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 9 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (fourteen votes to two); and that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '32. At the hearing on 18 May 1998 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to agree with the majority of the Commission that there had been no breach of Article 8 of the Convention in this case.', '33. On the same occasion the applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and to award her just satisfaction.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 of the Convention', '34. The applicant submitted that the police officers’ entry into her home and their failure to prevent her ex-husband’s entry violated Article 8 of the Convention, which provides (as relevant):', '“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private … life [and] his home …', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', '35. The Government contested these allegations, maintaining that the entry of the police into the applicant’s home was “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, and was proportionate to the aim of preventing disorder and crime. The Commission agreed with the Government.', ""A. Alleged interference with the applicant's right to respect for her private life and home"", '1. Existence of an interference', '36. It was not disputed that the entry of the police into the applicant’s home on 3 October 1989 constituted an interference with her right to respect for her private life and home. The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise.', '2. Justification for the interference', '37. Such interference breaches Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 8 § 2 and is, in addition, “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve the aim or aims in question.', '(a) “In accordance with the law”', '38. The applicant submitted that the common-law power of the police to enter private premises on the grounds of an anticipated breach of the peace was not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2. In this regard she argued, first, that the meaning of the concept “breach of the peace” was insufficiently clear and precise and that, in particular, there was inconsistent jurisprudence as to the meaning of “breach of the peace”. An element of apprehension by another was included in the definition of “breach of the peace”, which made it difficult in many cases for an individual to foresee the consequences of his acts; the degree of imminence required was uncertain; and it was not clear who of one or more individuals involved in an incident would be held responsible for causing the breach of the peace. Secondly, she maintained that the scope of the discretionary power of the police to enter private premises was not sufficiently clearly defined to provide protection from arbitrary interference.', '39. The Government contested this allegation, maintaining that the interference with the applicant’s rights was in accordance with the law. The common-law power of the police to enter private premises without a warrant to prevent a breach of the peace had been preserved by section 17(6) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 23 above). This provision, which was unequivocal in its terms, reflected the rule laid down in Thomas v. Sawkins (see paragraph 28 above); a rule that was formulated with sufficient precision to enable persons – including the police – to regulate their conduct.', 'Furthermore, they stressed that there was no ambiguity in the power of the police to enter private premises to prevent a breach of the peace. If there had been, Parliament would have clarified the power when the common-law powers of the police to enter private premises were reviewed in connection with the 1984 Act.', '40. The Commission considered that the rule in Thomas v. Sawkins, as recognised in McGowan v. Chief Police Constable of Kingston Upon Hull (see paragraph 29 above), had enabled the applicant reasonably to foresee that the police had had the right to enter and remain on her property to prevent a breach of the peace arising when her former husband collected his property from her home.', '41. The Court recalls that the expression “in accordance with the law”, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, requires firstly that the impugned measures should have a basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, amongst many others, the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, p. 25, § 75). However, those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty, since such certainty might give rise to excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49).', '42. In this connection, the Court observes that the concept of breach of the peace has been clarified by the English courts over the last two decades, to the extent that it is now sufficiently established that a breach of the peace is committed only when an individual causes harm, or appears likely to cause harm, to persons or property, or acts in a manner the natural consequence of which would be to provoke violence in others (see paragraphs 24 to 27 above).', '43. Furthermore, the English courts have recognised that the police have a duty to prevent a breach of the peace that they reasonably apprehend will occur and to stop a breach of the peace that is occurring. In the execution of this duty, the police have the power to enter into and remain on private property without the consent of the owner or occupier (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). Despite the general abolition of common-law powers of entry without warrant, this power was preserved by section 17(6) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 23 above).', '44. When considering whether the national law was complied with, the Court recalls that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, as a recent authority, the Kopp v. Switzerland judgment of 25 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 541, § 59). In this regard, the Court notes that in its decision the Court of Appeal took into account the criticisms of the common-law power of the police to enter private premises to prevent a breach of the peace cited by the applicant in her memorial to the Court, and found that the common-law power was applicable in situations involving domestic disturbance (see paragraph 21 above).', '45. In conclusion, the Court finds that the power of the police to enter private premises without a warrant to deal with or prevent a breach of the peace was defined with sufficient precision for the foreseeability criterion to be satisfied. The interference was, therefore, “in accordance with the law”.', '(b) Legitimate aim', '46. The applicant contended that, while the prevention of crime or disorder might be the objective behind the existence of the power, it was not the aim of the interference that took place in the present case. She submitted that the term “prevention” should be interpreted narrowly and should not encompass a situation where police officers by their own actions caused a risk of disorder and then assumed powers of entry to prevent it.', '47. The Government maintained that the purpose of the police officers’ entry into the applicant’s property was to prevent disorder or crime. In this regard, they drew attention to the fact that domestic strife was often the cause of considerable disorder and occasionally led to serious violence against persons or property. The Commission accepted this submission.', '48. The Court is of the view that the aim of the power enabling police officers to enter private premises to prevent a breach of the peace is clearly a legitimate one for the purposes of Article 8, namely the prevention of disorder or crime, and there is nothing to suggest that it was applied in the present case for any other purpose.', '(c) “Necessary in a democratic society”', '49. The applicant contended that, since section 17(1)(e) of the 1984 Act enabled the police to enter private premises to save life or limb or prevent serious damage to property, the power of the police to enter private premises in circumstances other than when there was a risk of physical harm to persons or property was not “necessary in a democratic society”.', 'Notwithstanding this contention she argued that, if the police chose to exercise their power of entry when there was no risk of physical injury or damage to property – which entailed a major infringement of the rights guaranteed under Article 8 of the Convention – the justification for the interference should be significant and indisputable. Furthermore, justification for the entry had to be made by reference to the degree of risk that existed at the time the police entered the property. In the present case, since there was no history of violence between the applicant and her ex ‑ husband and the only person present at the house at the time of entry was her 74-year-old mother, the risk of harm was minimal or non ‑ existent. Weighing this against the seriousness of the interference, the actions of the police could not be regarded as proportionate. In addition, they demonstrated such a lack of impartiality as to render the exercise of the powers disproportionate to the aim pursued.', '50. The Government claimed that, because there was a clear pressing social need to prevent disorder or crime, the power of the police to enter private premises without permission to prevent a breach of the peace was “necessary in a democratic society”. With regard to the present case, they submitted that the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, as demonstrated by the fact that the visit to the applicant’s home by her former husband to collect his possessions was made in the genuine, albeit mistaken, belief that she had agreed to the arrangement; the ex-husband’s solicitors feared that a breach of the peace might occur because of the history of the court proceedings between their client and the applicant; the police officers attended the applicant’s home not to assist in the removal of the property but to maintain the peace; they acted in a discreet and reasonable manner; and the applicant’s conduct on her return did call for their intervention.', '51. The Commission, placing emphasis on the risk of disturbance that might have arisen if the applicant’s ex-husband and his party had gained access on their own, found that the measures taken by the police officers – who acted, in its opinion, with restraint throughout the incident – were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Although the police officers had had limited possibilities of knowing the precise nature of private relations between the couple, they were under a duty to take seriously an indication from one party that trouble might arise.', '52. The Court recalls that, according to its established case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp. 31–32, § 67).', '53. The Court’s task accordingly consists in ascertaining whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the entry of the police into the applicant’s home struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely the applicant’s right to respect for her private life and home, on the one hand, and the prevention of disorder and crime, on the other.', '54. The Court notes that on the morning of 3 October 1989, Mr McLeod’s solicitors, knowing the long and acrimonious history of the divorce proceedings, contacted the police requesting their attendance in order to avoid a breach of the peace occurring while their client’s property was being removed from the applicant’s home. Two police officers were instructed to attend. Upon arriving at the applicant’s home, the police officers were shown a copy of the list of property that was to be removed, but not the order accompanying it (see paragraph 12 above).', 'One of the police officers knocked at the door of the house and was told by the applicant’s mother that the applicant was not at home. Mr McLeod and his party entered the house and began removing the property. The police officers also entered the house, but did not participate in the removal of the property. One of them, however, checked that only items mentioned on the list were removed. When the applicant returned home, she became angry and demanded that the property that had been loaded into the van be put back into the house. One of the police officers intervened, insisting that the van be driven away and that any dispute should be left to the parties’ solicitors (see paragraphs 13 to 15 above).', '55. The Court considers that, since Mr McLeod’s solicitors genuinely believed that a breach of the peace might occur when their client removed his property from the former matrimonial home, the police could not be faulted for responding to their request for assistance. In this regard, it notes that the domestic courts accepted that a situation that might begin as a domestic quarrel could develop into a breach of the peace (see paragraph 18 above).', '56. However, the Court observes that, notwithstanding the facts that the police were contacted in advance by Mr McLeod’s solicitors and that the solicitor’s clerk offered to return to his office and collect the court order (see paragraph 12 above), the police did not take any steps to verify whether Mr McLeod was entitled to enter her home on 3 October 1989 and remove his property. Sight of the court order would have indicated that it was for the applicant to deliver the property, and not for her former husband to collect it, and moreover that she had three more days in which to do so (see paragraph 11 above). Admittedly, the court order would not have enabled the police officers to ascertain the correctness of Mr McLeod’s genuinely held belief that an agreement had been made between himself and his ex-wife allowing him to remove his property from the former matrimonial home on 3 October 1989 – a belief that was communicated to the police officers upon their arrival (see paragraph 12 above). Nonetheless, given the circumstances of the interference, and the fact that the applicant was not present and that her mother lacked any knowledge of the agreement (see paragraph 13 above), the police should not have taken it for granted that an agreement had been reached superseding the relevant parts of the court order.', '57. The Court considers further that, upon being informed that the applicant was not present, the police officers should not have entered her house, as it should have been clear to them that there was little or no risk of disorder or crime occurring. It notes in this regard that the police officers remained outside the property for some of the time, suggesting a belief on their part that a breach of the peace was not likely to occur in the absence of the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). The fact that an altercation did occur upon her return (see paragraph 15 above) is, in its opinion, immaterial in ascertaining whether the police officers were justified in entering the property initially.', '58. For the above reasons, the Court finds that the means employed by the police officers were disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.', 'B. Alleged failure to comply with a positive obligation', '59. The applicant argued that the respondent State had failed in its obligation to protect her right to respect for her home from unlawful interference by other private individuals. In particular, the police officers had facilitated the unlawful entry of her ex-husband, his siblings and the solicitors’ clerk; they had failed to ascertain whether her ex-husband and the others had been entitled to enter her house; they had failed to take any steps to prevent them from damaging the house and committing trespass to goods; and they had failed to provide proper protection to her mother.', '60. At the hearing before the Court, the Delegate of the Commission submitted that in light of the fact that the applicant had been awarded substantial damages against her former husband and the persons accompanying him in connection with the trespass (see paragraph 19 above), it was questionable whether she could still claim to be a victim in this respect. Notwithstanding this submission, the Delegate was of the opinion that a number of difficulties would arise if the State was required to protect persons against trespass by private individuals not only ex post facto but also in advance. Accordingly, she invited the Court to address this case solely on the basis of whether there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private life and home.', 'The Government agreed with the Delegate’s submission.', '61. Having regard to its finding that the entry of the police officers into the applicant’s home was not justified under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 58 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to examine further this complaint.', 'II. Alleged violation of article 1 of protocol no. 1', '62. Before the Commission the applicant alleged that the police and the courts had failed to show respect for her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, she did not maintain this complaint in the present proceedings and the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion (see, as a recent authority, the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1574, § 75).', 'III. application of Article 50 of the Convention', '63. The applicant requested the Court to grant her just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides as follows:', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Non-pecuniary damage', '64. In her memorial the applicant requested the Court to award her compensation for non-pecuniary damage. However, at the hearing she informed the Court that, if it were to find a violation of the Convention, she would be prepared to forego this claim.', '65. The Court considers that, in the circumstances, a finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '66. The applicant claimed her personal costs and expenses arising from the proceedings before the domestic courts and the Strasbourg institutions which amounted to 5,523.39 pounds sterling (GBP): Ms McLeod had represented herself before the domestic courts and the Commission, for which she asked to be compensated at the rate specified under domestic law for litigants in person, and had incurred travel and other expenses amounting to GBP 1,577.64. In addition, she claimed solicitors’ costs of GBP 3,829.21 (inclusive of value-added tax “VAT”) and counsels’ fees of GBP 15,275 (inclusive of VAT).', '67. At the hearing, the Government submitted that it would not be proper to compensate the applicant for the time spent preparing her case at domestic level and before the Commission. In addition, they suggested that the amount claimed in respect of counsel’s fees was excessive.', '68. The Delegate of the Commission had no comments to make on the amounts claimed.', '69. Following the criteria established in its case-law, the Court is unable to compensate the applicant for the time she spent working on the case (see, amongst other authorities, the Robins v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, p. 1812, § 44). Deciding on an equitable basis and having regard to the details of the claims submitted by her, it awards the applicant a total of GBP 15,000 in respect both of disbursements necessarily and reasonably incurred by herself and solicitors’ costs and counsels’ fees.', 'C. Default interest', '70. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.']",3,gb,001-58241,0

Mr Lehideux, the first applicant, who was born in 1904 and died on 21 June 1998 (see paragraph 8 above), was formerly an administrator and later a director of several companies – including Renault France – and lived in Paris. From September 1940 to April 1942 he was Minister for Industrial Production in the Government of Marshal Pétain and, from 1959 to 1964, a member of the Economic and Social Committee. He was the President of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain.', 'The second applicant, Mr Isorni, who was born in 1911 and died on 8 May 1995 (see paragraph 2 above), was formerly a lawyer practising in Paris. As First Secretary of the Conference of Pupil Advocates of the Paris Bar, he was officially appointed to assist the President of the Bar Association in defending Marshal Pétain at his trial before the High Court of Justice. On 15 August 1945 the High Court of Justice sentenced Philippe Pétain to death and forfeiture of his civic rights for collusion with Germany with a view to furthering the designs of the enemy.', 'A. The publication in issue', '10. On 13 July 1984 the daily newspaper Le Monde published a one-page advertisement bearing the title “People of France, you have short memories” in large print, beneath which appeared in small italics, “Philippe Pétain, 17 June 1941”. The text ended with an invitation to readers to write to the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain and the National Pétain -Verdun Association.', '11. The text, which was divided into several sections each beginning with the words “People of France, you have short memories if you have forgotten…” in large capitals, recapitulated, in a series of assertions, the main stages of Philippe Pétain’s life as a public figure from 1916 to 1945, presenting his actions, first as a soldier and later as French Head of State, in a positive light.', 'In respect of the 1940–45 period, the text contained the following passage:', '“PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES', '– IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN...', '– That in 1940 the civil and military authorities had led France to disaster. Those responsible begged him to come to its assistance. By his call to the nation of 17 June 1940 he secured an armistice and prevented the enemy from camping on the shores of the Mediterranean, thereby saving the Allies. Power was then legally conferred on him by the Parliamentary Assemblies, in which the Popular Front had a majority. The grateful French people rightly saw him as their saviour. There were ‘forty million Pétainists ’ (Henri Amouroux ).', 'How many no longer remember this and how many have disavowed it?', '– That in the thick of difficulties which no French Head of State had ever known, Nazi atrocities and persecutions, he protected them against German omnipotence and barbarism, thus ensuring that two million prisoners of war were saved.', '– That he provided daily bread, re-established social justice, defended private schools and protected a pillaged economy.', '– That, through his supremely skilful policy, he managed to send a personal representative to London on the very same day that he went to Montoire, thereby allowing France, in defeat, to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the Germans and the Allies and, through his secret agreements with America, to prepare and contribute to its liberation, for which he had formed the army of Africa.', '– That he preserved for France virtually every part of what people then still dared to call the French Empire.', '– That he was threatened by Hitler and Ribbentrop for resisting their will, and that on 20 August 1944 German troops carried him off to Germany.', 'PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES', '– IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN...', '– That, while he was a prisoner of the enemy, Philippe Pétain was prosecuted on the orders of Charles de Gaulle for betraying his country, whereas he had done all he could to save it.', '– IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN...', '– That, having escaped from Germany, he returned to France, however great the personal risk to himself, to defend himself against that monstrous accusation and to try to protect, by his presence, those who had obeyed his orders.', 'PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES', '– IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN...', '– That the prosecution, with the collusion of persons in the highest authority, used a forgery, as in the Dreyfus case, to secure his conviction and that at ninety years of age he was condemned, in haste, to death...”', 'B. The criminal proceedings against the applicants', '1. The complaint which led to the prosecution', '12. On 10 October 1984 the National Association of Former Members of the Resistance filed a criminal complaint, together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party, against a Mr L., the publication manager of Le Monde, for publicly defending the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, and against Mr Lehideux as President of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain, Mr Isorni as the author of the text complained of and a Mr M., as President of the National Pétain -Verdun Association, for aiding and abetting a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy.', 'The civil party argued that the text was an apologia which contravened the criminal law since it tended to justify the policy of Marshal Pétain, who had been found guilty by the High Court of Justice on 15 August 1945 (see paragraph 9 above).', '13. The applicants denied that their advertisement constituted a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, but acknowledged that the spirit of the text was consistent with their aim of having the judgment of the High Court of Justice overturned and rehabilitating Marshal Pétain.', '14. On 29 May 1985 the public prosecutor filed his final submissions recommending that the charges be dropped on the ground that the offence had not been made out.', 'He considered that “the political and historical light” in which the applicants had portrayed Philippe Pétain’s policy during the period 1940 to 1944 was “radically different from the approach adopted by the High Court of Justice”: “far from glorifying the policy of collaboration, the defendants ... [gave] credit to Marshal Pétain – the fact that their historical perception [might] appear incorrect, misguided or partisan being of little consequence – for his endeavours and actions to protect France and its people and his contribution to the country’s liberation...”. He added that, although their aim had been to enhance Philippe Pétain’s image and praise his conduct during the Second World War, this positive assessment could be construed as a public defence of his actions “only by arbitrarily separating the image thus embellished from its supporting text and its link with the purely extrinsic information which, for the most part, was contained in the documents on the High Court’s file”. He concluded that “it might appear strange to commit for trial before the Criminal Court the authors and producers of a text which glorifies an individual, not for the crimes of which he was convicted, but for the beneficial actions which he is deemed to have performed for the good of France, its people and, secretly, the Allies”.', '15. The investigating judge did not follow the public prosecutor’s submissions. In an order of 4 June 1985, he committed Mr L., the applicants and Mr M. for trial before the Criminal Court on charges, against the first defendant as principal and the others as accomplices, of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, defined in section 24(3) of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881.', 'The investigating judge observed: “a public defence means a speech or text which tends to defend or vindicate a doctrine or an action”. He noted that the applicants had presented Marshal Pétain’s policy during the period 1940 to 1944 in a favourable light, crediting him with endeavours and actions to protect France and its people, whereas the same events had been the subject of lengthy, detailed reasoning in the judgment of the High Court of Justice convicting Marshal Pétain. He therefore considered that the part of the published text referring to the 1940–45 period incorporated, developed and glorified the grounds of defence submitted by Pétain at his trial before the High Court of Justice and therefore amounted to a “justification of the actions and policies of Marshal Pétain, convicted under Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code” then in force.', '2. The Paris Criminal Court’s judgment of 27 June 1986', '16. On 27 June 1986 the Paris Criminal Court, the proceedings before which had been joined by the Resistance Action Committee and the National Federation of Deported and Interned Members of the Resistance and Patriots, as civil parties, acquitted the defendants and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the civil parties’ application.', 'The court stated that its task was “not to take sides in the historical controversy which, for more than forty years, has pitted the Resistance associations against Philippe Pétain’s supporters”, but to determine whether the offence had been made out in the instant case. In that connection, the court specified that, “according to the civil parties’ and the public prosecutor’s own submissions, the defendants [were] being prosecuted for their opinions...” and that “no restrictions [could] be imposed on freedom of expression other than those derived from statute, strictly interpreted...”.', 'The court held that only the part of the text referring to the 1940–45 period could be construed as a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy. It noted that this part of the text was clearly a eulogy of Philippe Pétain, an appeal in his defence designed to create a shift in public opinion favourable to the reopening of his case. It considered, however, that the offence had not been made out, for the following reasons: the text contained “no attempt to justify collaboration with Nazi Germany”, but stated that Marshal Pétain’s aim had been to “facilitate the Allies’ victory”; Marshal Pétain’s collaboration with Nazi Germany was neither acknowledged nor presented in a favourable light; the fact that the judgment of the High Court of Justice constituted res judicata did not in any way prevent the defenders of Marshal Pétain’s memory from criticising it; the text was part of a campaign in which the second applicant had been engaged since 1945 to have the judgment of the High Court of Justice overturned, an objective which was “perfectly legal”.', 'The court emphasised, “for the avoidance of any doubt”, that its judgment “should not be deemed to favour one of the arguments put forward in the historical controversy”.', '17. The National Association of Former Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed.', '3. The Paris Court of Appeal’s judgment of 8 July 1987', '18. In a judgment of 8 July 1987 the Paris Court of Appeal held, firstly, that the combined effect of Article 2 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 was that the civil parties did not have standing to trigger a public prosecution and, secondly, that the prosecutor’s submissions on their complaint did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down on pain of nullity in the same Act. The court therefore declared the prosecution and subsequent proceedings null and void.', '19. The National Association of Former Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed on points of law against the above judgment.', '4. The Court of Cassation’s judgment of 20 December 1988', '20. In a judgment of 20 December 1988 the Court of Cassation (Criminal Division) held that the Paris Court of Appeal had erred in law. Accordingly, it quashed the judgment of 8 July 1987 in its entirety and remitted the case to the same Court of Appeal with a differently constituted bench.', '5. The Paris Court of Appeal’s judgment of 26 January 1990', '21. On 26 January 1990 the Paris Court of Appeal declared the two civil party applications admissible, set aside the acquittals and awarded the civil parties damages of one franc. It also ordered the publication of excerpts from the judgment in Le Monde.', 'In its judgment it held that the three constituent elements of the offence of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration had been made out.', 'It found, firstly, that the public element had been made out owing to the fact that the text in question had been published in Le Monde.', 'It went on to say that the text contained an “apologia” for the crimes of collaboration, and that the mental element had been made out, for the following reasons:', '“The glorification of Pétain by the authors of this manifesto is conveyed by the celebration of what they seek to portray as great deeds; thus, equal prominence is given, for example, to the victory at Verdun and the defeat at Abd -el- Krim, attributed to Pétain like the securing of the armistice in 1940 and ‘his policy’, described as ‘supremely skilful’: ‘He managed to send a personal representative to London on the very same day that he went to Montoire, thereby allowing France, in defeat, to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the Germans and the Allies and, through his secret agreements with America, to prepare and contribute to its liberation, for which he had formed the army of Africa’. Praise of the Montoire policy is thus magnified by reference to its supposed results. This is indeed an unreserved eulogy of a policy which is none other than that of collaboration. The significance of the meeting between Pétain and Hitler at Montoire on 24 October 1940 to which the authors of the advertisement refer were specified as follows in a radio broadcast by Pétain of 30 October 1940:', '‘It is in honour and in order to maintain French unity, a ten-centuries-old unity, within the framework of constructive action for a new European order that I today embark upon the path of collaboration. ’', 'The order referred to here was none other than the Hitlerian order based on racism defined in Mein Kampf, to which Pétain had just officially subscribed in advance by signing, on 3 October 1940, the so-called Act relating to aliens of Jewish race, who were later to be interned in camps set up in France for that purpose, in order to facilitate their conveyance to the Nazi concentration camps which were their intended destination.', 'Through the absence from the text of any criticism of these artfully concealed facts or even any attempt to distance its authors from them, this manifesto does indeed, therefore, implicitly but necessarily, contain an apologia for the crimes of collaboration committed, sometimes with the active participation and sometimes with the tacit consent of the Vichy Government, that is of Pétain and his zealots, in the very ‘atrocities’ and ‘Nazi persecutions’ to which the text refers.', 'The court is forced to the above conclusion without taking sides in the historical controversy between those who think that Pétain was really playing a double game supposedly beneficial to the French and those who place reliance only on Pétain’s avowed policies and publicly announced official decisions, regardless of the excuses that he was able to put forward or that his supporters now seek to cloak him in. Accordingly, this court finds that the advertisement in issue did contain the apologetic element of the offence charged.', 'In addition, for the offence to be made out, the mental element must be established.', 'The accused, headed by Jacques Isorni, the author of the manifesto, are seeking revision of the judgment given by the High Court of Justice on 14 August 1945, which sentenced Pétain to death, forfeiture of his civic rights and confiscation of his possessions for collusion with Germany, a power at war with France, with a view to furthering the enemy’s designs, this conduct constituting offences defined by and punishable under Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code.', 'The accused, with the exception of [Mr L.], all claim responsibility for the text in issue and maintain that their object in publishing it was to create a shift in public opinion which, in their view, would increase support for a decision to reopen the case.', 'This goal, pursued unremittingly by Jacques Isorni in particular, Pétain’s former defence counsel before the High Court, who seeks to have a new judicial decision substituted for the High Court’s judgment, is considered by that lawyer to be a sacred duty of the defence. However legitimate on his part and the part of those who expressed their support for his action their intention to have the case reopened may have been, it did not justify the use of unlawful means to further that aim, since they knew that by putting forward an unqualified and unrestricted eulogy of the policy of collaboration they were ipso facto justifying the crimes committed in furtherance of that policy, and therefore cannot have acted in good faith.”', '6. The Court of Cassation’s judgment of 16 November 1993', '22. The applicants, Mr M. and Mr L. appealed on points of law against the above judgment. In their statement of the grounds of appeal they relied on Article 10 of the Convention and complained that they had been convicted for their opinions. Their aim had been to defend what they considered to be just in the action of a convicted person, without glorifying war crimes or the crimes of collaboration of which he had been convicted in the judgment which they were seeking to have overturned. They asserted that the Court of Appeal had found them guilty of making an “implicit apologia”, constituted more by what they had not said than by the content of the text itself, holding that the manifesto in issue “implicitly but necessarily” contained an apologia for the crimes of collaboration and convicting them for what they had not written and the criticisms they had not made, despite the fact that they had referred in their text to Nazi atrocities and barbarism.', '23. On 16 November 1993 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeals on the following grounds:', '“Having regard [to the] findings [of the Court of Appeal] the Court of Cassation, whose task is to determine whether the text prosecuted under section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 constitutes a public defence of the crimes contemplated in that Act, is satisfied from its examination of the article in question that the passage referred to by the Court of Appeal falls within the contemplation of the aforementioned Act. In presenting as praiseworthy a person convicted of collusion with the enemy, the text glorified his crime and, in so doing, publicly defended it. The mental element of the offence can be inferred from the deliberate nature of the acts on account of which the defendants were charged.', 'In delivering that judgment, the Court of Appeal did not exceed its powers. Nor did it infringe the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10, paragraph 1, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, since the exercise of that right may, under paragraph 2 of that Article, be subject to certain restrictions prescribed by law, where these are necessary, as in the instant case, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety.”']","['II. Relevant domestic law', 'A. The Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881', '24. In 1984 section 23 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 read as follows:', '“Where a crime or major offence is committed, anyone who, by uttering speeches, cries or threats in a public place or assembly, or by means of a written or printed text, drawing, engraving, painting, emblem, image, or any other written, spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed, offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly, or by means of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public, has directly and successfully incited another or others to commit the said crime or major offence shall be punished as an accomplice thereto.”', '25. At the same time, section 24 provided that “anyone who, by one of the means set out in section 23, has made a public defence of ... the crimes of collaboration with the enemy” was to be liable to one to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from three hundred to three hundred thousand francs.', '26. The French courts have gradually clarified the conditions for the application of the provisions making public defence of a crime a criminal offence.', 'The Court of Cassation has ruled that public defence of the crimes defined in section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 is a separate offence from unsuccessful incitement to commit one of the crimes listed in sub-sections 1 and 2 of the same section and that the constituent elements of each of those offences must not be confused ( Crim. 11 July 1972, Bull. crim. no. 236).', 'As early as 1912 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation held that public defence of a criminal amounted to public defence of his crime ( Crim. 22 August 1912, Bull. crim. no. 46). That case-law was upheld by a decision to the effect that the glorification of a person on the basis of facts constituting one of the crimes or major offences listed in section 24(3) of the 1881 Act constituted the crime of public defence defined in and punishable under that Act ( Crim. 24 October 1967, Bull. crim. no. 263).', 'Publication of a text which is likely to incite any reader to judge favourably the German National Socialist Party leaders convicted of war crimes by the Nuremberg International Tribunal and constitutes an attempt to justify their crimes in part is a public defence of war crimes ( Crim. 14 January 1971, Bull. crim. no. 14).', 'A public defence of the crime of theft is made out where an article is published which, far from merely relating a criminal theft, presents it as a praiseworthy exploit and expresses the hope that the perpetrator will escape all punishment ( Crim. 2 November 1978, Bull. crim. no. 294).', 'The offence is made out where an apologia is presented in indirect form (Paris, 25 February 1959, D. 1959. 552).', 'Lastly, it is the Court of Cassation’s task to determine whether a text prosecuted under section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 partakes of the nature of a public defence of crime as defined therein ( Crim. 11 July 1972, Bull. crim. no. 236).', '27. Law no. 90-615 of 13 July 1990 (“the loi Gayssot ”) added to the Freedom of the Press Act a section 24 bis making liable to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of 300,000 French francs, or one of those penalties only, those who “deny the existence of one or more crimes against humanity as defined in Article 6 of the Statute of the International Military Tribunal annexed to the London agreement of 8 August 1945 which have been committed either by the members of an organisation declared criminal pursuant to Article 9 of the Statute or by a person found guilty of such crimes by a French or international court”.', 'Section 48-2 of the Freedom of the Press Act, also inserted by the loi Gayssot, provides: “Any association which has been lawfully registered for at least five years at the relevant time, and whose objects, according to its articles of association, include the defence of the moral interests and honour of the French Resistance or deportees, may exercise the rights conferred on civil parties in connection with public defence of war crimes, crimes against humanity or the crimes of collaboration with the enemy and in connection with the offence defined in section 24 bis. ”', 'B. The Criminal Code', '28. Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code, applied by the High Court of Justice in its judgment of 15 August 1945 convicting Marshal Pétain, provided at that time:', 'Article 75', '“Any French citizen who colludes with a foreign power with a view to inciting it to engage in hostilities against France, or provides it with the necessary means, either by facilitating the penetration of foreign forces into French territory, or by undermining the loyalty of the army, navy or air force, or in any other manner, shall be guilty of treason and sentenced to death.”', 'Article 87', '“Any attempt to overthrow or change the government ..., or to incite citizens or inhabitants to take up arms against the imperial authority shall be punishable by deportation to a military fortress.”', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '29. Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni applied to the Commission on 13 May 1994, complaining of a breach of Articles 6, 10 and, in substance, 7 of the Convention. In support of their application they produced a large number of documents, which included copies of several memoranda obtained from British official records describing contacts which took place in October and December 1940 between the then British government, led by Winston Churchill, and Louis Rougier, an emissary of Philippe Pétain.', '30. On 24 June 1996 the Commission declared the Article 10 complaint admissible and declared the remainder of the application (no. 24662/94) inadmissible. In its report of 8 April 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (twenty-three votes to eight). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the six separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '31. In their memorial the Government asked the Court to dismiss the application lodged by Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni, firstly as being incompatible with the provisions of the Convention pursuant to Article 17, and in the alternative because there had been no violation of Article 10.', '32. The applicants asked the Court to hold that there had been a breach of Article 10 and to award them just satisfaction.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention', '33. The applicants alleged that their conviction for “public defence of war crimes or the crimes of collaboration” had breached Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '34. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application, pursuant to Article 17 of the Convention, on the ground of incompatibility with the provisions of the Convention. At the very least, in their submission, paragraph 2 of Article 10 should be applied in the light of the obligations arising from Article 17.', 'A. Application of Article 17', '35. The Government considered that the publication in issue infringed the very spirit of the Convention and the essential values of democracy. The application of Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni was accordingly barred by Article 17, which provides:', '“Nothing in [the] Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.”', 'The justification given by the applicants for publishing the text in issue – that they sought to overturn Philippe Pétain’s conviction – was unacceptable, as were their assertions about their text being a contribution to the historical debate. The text presented certain historical events in a manifestly erroneous manner, sometimes by lending them a significance they did not have, as in the way they had presented the Montoire meeting, and sometimes by ignoring events which were essential for an understanding of the relevant period of history, namely collaboration between the Vichy regime and Nazi Germany.', '36. Before the Commission the applicants submitted that Article 17 could not be invoked against them, emphasising that a distinction should be drawn between the basis for the conviction of Philippe Pétain, the former Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code, and the basis of their own conviction, the Press Act. They further emphasised that their text had by no means expressed approval of Nazi barbarism and its persecutions.', '37. In its decision on the admissibility of the application (see paragraph 30 above), the Commission expressed the opinion that Article 17 could not prevent the applicants from relying on Article 10. It considered that the advertisement which had given rise to the applicants’ conviction did not contain any terms of racial hatred or other statements calculated to destroy or restrict the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. As the Paris Court of Appeal had recognised in its judgment of 26 January 1990, the applicants’ object had been to secure revision of Philippe Pétain’s trial. Furthermore, it could not be deduced from the text that the applicants’ expression of their ideas constituted an “activity” within the meaning of Article 17.', '38. The Court will rule on the application of Article 17 in the light of all the circumstances of the case. It will accordingly begin by considering the question of compliance with Article 10, whose requirements it will however assess in the light of Article 17 (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 18, § 32).', 'B. Compliance with Article 10', '39. The conviction in issue incontestably amounted to “interference” with the applicants’ exercise of their right to freedom of expression. Those appearing before the Court agreed that it was “prescribed by law” and pursued several of the legitimate aims set forth in Article 10 § 2, namely protection of the reputation or rights of others and the prevention of disorder or crime.', 'The Court agrees. It must now, therefore, determine whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims.', '1. Arguments of the participants', '(a) The applicants', '40. The applicants argued that the text in issue reflected a historical opinion and imparted information about a subject of general interest. Their conviction had been intended to impose a “politically correct” version of history.', 'The text was a contribution to the historical controversy about the period 1940–44. Although there might be disagreement about its content, history was a field in which differences of opinion were desirable. The text had been based on exact historical facts, not misrepresented or incomplete facts as the Government had maintained. With particular regard to the omissions criticised by the Government, the applicants explained that their text had been intended only to promote the campaign for Philippe Pétain’s retrial, without setting out to raise any other issues. In any event, since they had not distorted real historical events, they could not be assimilated or compared, in their action and their writings, to negationists or revisionists. Moreover, the courts that had dealt with their case had not all been convinced of their guilt.', 'In short, the applicants had not contested either Nazi atrocities and barbarism or the Holocaust. They had not endorsed a policy. They had merely said: “Perhaps something else took place”, something other than what people thought, namely that, on account of his incomparable past record as a military leader, the man who had been the head of the French State could only have desired victory by the Allies.', '(b) The Government', '41. The Government submitted that, as regards in the first place the aim of the text in issue, the applicants were trying to justify the text after the event, claiming that it had been written with a view to applying for revision of Philippe Pétain’s trial. That argument was inadmissible, because Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni had not been convicted by the Paris Court of Appeal on account of their real or supposed aim in publishing the text but on account of the text itself. The Court of Appeal had said very clearly, in its judgment of 26 January 1990, that whatever the applicants’ intention might have been in publishing the text, that intention did not justify them in eulogising the policy of collaboration.', 'That being said, neither the constitution of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain nor the text in issue referred at any point, in one way or another, to securing a retrial for Philippe Pétain.', '42. The Government further asserted that there was no doubt that if the French authorities had been able to consider that the text published by the applicants in the 13 July 1984 issue of Le Monde was merely a contribution to a historical debate, its authors would never have been convicted. However, the publication of a text which was supposed to be a contribution to a public debate of a historical nature obliged its authors to observe a number of constraints and rules, taking into account facts deemed to be common knowledge at the time of writing. That had not been done in the present case, because neither the presentation of the text in issue nor its content satisfied the minimum requirements of objectivity.', 'In the first place, the text had appeared in the form of an advertisement. The repetition of certain phrases, and even the presentation, in terms of the typeface chosen, had been used to attract the reader’s attention. A more serious criticism was that the content of the text itself, as was noted in the judgment convicting the applicants, constituted an unreserved eulogy of the policy conducted by the Vichy government, led by Philippe Pétain, although that policy had been one of collaboration by the State with the National Socialist regime. The applicants had gone about composing that eulogy in two different ways. Firstly, they had attempted to justify Philippe Pétain’s decisions by trying to give them a different meaning; secondly, they had purely and simply omitted to mention historical facts which were a matter of common knowledge, and were inescapable and essential for any objective account of the policy concerned.', 'The Montoire episode illustrated the first method used by the applicants. They had tried to justify this argument by talk of a double-game policy supposedly followed at that time by the head of the Vichy government. At the time when the text was published, this theory had been refuted by all historians who had made a special study of the period.', 'As to the second method, it consisted in omission. Omitting to mention the racial legislation enacted in October 1940 was a perfect example. By omitting in particular to make any reference in a publication glorifying Philippe Pétain to what was – in the words of the American historian Robert Paxton – “the blackest mark on the whole Vichy experience”, namely its active anti-Semitism, the applicants had deliberately chosen to remain silent about the most scandalous acts of the Vichy government, which were recognised as real historical events and had also objectively served the interests of the National Socialist regime.', 'In other words, although Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni were not negationists, in order to glorify Philippe Pétain’s record during the Second World War they had been impelled to deny, by deliberately omitting to mention it, the existence of his policy of collaboration with the Third Reich. Such a denial was unacceptable to all those who had paid the price of that policy with their lives or the lives of their relatives, either because they had been marked out as its victims or because they had chosen to fight against it.', '43. In order to assess the necessity of interference with the applicants’ freedom of expression, the national authorities, in the Government’s submission, had had a wider margin of appreciation, for two reasons. Firstly, the text in issue had been published in the form of an advertisement. Secondly, it had referred to a particularly grim page of the history of France. This had still been a very painful part of the collective memory at the time of the applicants’ conviction, and remained so, given the difficulty in France of determining who was responsible, whether isolated individuals or entire institutions, for the policy of collaboration with the National Socialist regime.', 'Irrespective of its content, the text dealt with a very specific field – the history of a State. That field, by its very nature, was impossible to define objectively in European terms, so that there could be no uniform conception of the requirements arising from Article 10. Quite obviously, the countries of Europe could not have a uniform conception of the requirements relating to “protection of the rights of others” in connection with the effects of a publication in a national daily newspaper on the role played by Philippe Pétain during the Second World War.', 'At all events, the penalty eventually imposed had been purely symbolic, since Mr Lehideux and Mr Isorni had been ordered to pay all in all to each of the two associations which had joined the proceedings as civil parties the sum of one franc in damages and to pay for publication in Le Monde of the judgment against them.', '(c) The Commission', '44. The Commission considered that a number of factors took the present case outside the scope of commercial or advertising material. Apart from the fact that the prosecution had been based on the Freedom of the Press Act, the article had concerned a politician and historical events, and had invited the reader to write to two associations in order to bring about a shift in public opinion favourable to revision of Philippe Pétain’s trial. Consequently, although the text was presented in the form of a separate advertisement and contained repeated phrases calculated to arrest the reader’s attention, its content and purpose did not bring it within the competitive or commercial domains, or even into that of professional advertising within the meaning of the Court’s case-law (see the Barthold v. Germany judgment of 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90; the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165; the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A; and the Jacubowski v. Germany judgment of 23 June 1994, Series A no. 291-A).', '45. According to the Commission, the correctness or incorrectness of the facts presented by the applicants – which it was not in any way its task to verify – had not been the basis on which they were convicted. The Court of Appeal had criticised the applicants more for their non-exhaustive presentation of facts relating to a specific period of history than for distorting or denying established historical events.', 'The applicants had expressed themselves on behalf of two associations which had been legally constituted in France and whose object was, precisely, to have Marshal Pétain’s case reopened; they could not therefore be denied the right to pursue this object through the press or any other medium of communication. Moreover, the applicants had not failed to mention in the text and distance themselves from “Nazi atrocities and persecutions”.', 'Lastly, the Commission emphasised the importance, in a democratic society, of historical debate about a public figure in respect of whom, as was the case with Philippe Pétain, different opinions had been and might be expressed. For these reasons, the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10.', '2. The Court’s assessment', '46. The Court notes that, according to the Government, the eulogy the applicants were guilty of was produced by two different methods: the authors of the publication in issue had sometimes tried to justify Philippe Pétain’s decisions by endeavouring to give them a different meaning and at other times had purely and simply omitted to mention historical facts which were a matter of common knowledge, and were inescapable and essential for any objective account of the policy concerned.', '47. The first technique had been used in the passage concerning Philippe Pétain’s policy at Montoire. By describing this policy in the text as “supremely skilful”, the applicants had lent credence to the so-called “double game” theory, even though they knew that by 1984 all historians, both French and non-French, refuted that theory.', 'The Court considers that it is not its task to settle this point, which is part of an ongoing debate among historians about the events in question and their interpretation. As such, it does not belong to the category of clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust – whose negation or revision would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17. In the present case, it does not appear that the applicants attempted to deny or revise what they themselves referred to in their publication as “Nazi atrocities and persecutions” or “German omnipotence and barbarism”. In describing Philippe Pétain’s policy as “supremely skilful”, the authors of the text were rather supporting one of the conflicting theories in the debate about the role of the head of the Vichy government, the so-called “double game” theory.', '48. Moreover, the Court notes that the applicants did not act in their personal capacities, as the only names which appeared at the foot of the text in issue were those of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain and the National Pétain -Verdun Association, to which readers were invited to write. Since these associations were legally constituted and sought to promote the rehabilitation of Philippe Pétain, it was scarcely surprising to find them supporting, in a publication which they had paid for, one of the rival historical theories, the one which was most favourable to the man whose memory they sought to defend. Besides, readers were given a clear indication of how matters stood by the inclusion of the associations’ names at the foot of the page and by the word “Advertisement” which appeared at the top of the page.', 'In any event, the Paris Court of Appeal noted that the applicants’ aim, in publishing the text in issue, had been “to create a shift in public opinion which, in their view, would increase support for a decision to reopen the case”. It went on to say: “However legitimate … their intention to have the case reopened may have been, it did not justify the use of unlawful means to further that aim…” (see paragraph 21 above).', '49. The Court notes that in its judgment of 26 January 1990 the Paris Court of Appeal ruled “without taking sides in the historical controversy between those who think that Pétain was really playing a double game supposedly beneficial to the French and those who place reliance only on Pétain’s avowed policies and publicly announced official decisions, regardless of the excuses that he was able to put forward or that his supporters now seek to cloak him in” (see paragraph 21 above).', 'In support of the conviction the Paris Court of Appeal, in reasoning later upheld by the Court of Cassation, placed rather more emphasis on the second method criticised by the Government, namely the omission of essential historical facts, which, it found, had constituted the apologia in issue. Thus, after noting “an unreserved eulogy of [the Montoire ] policy, which [was] none other than that of collaboration” the Court of Appeal held that “by putting forward an unqualified and unrestricted eulogy of the policy of collaboration [the applicants] were ipso facto justifying the crimes committed in furtherance of that policy”. At another point in its judgment it held: “this manifesto does indeed, therefore, implicitly but necessarily, contain an apologia for the crimes of collaboration”; that apologia resulted from “the absence from the text of any criticism of these artfully concealed facts or even any attempt to distance its authors from them”, the facts concerned being the support Pétain gave to “the Hitlerian order based on racism” by signing on 3 October 1940 the so-called Act relating to aliens of Jewish race (see paragraph 21 above).', '50. The Court does not have to express an opinion on the constituent elements of the offence under French law of publicly defending the crimes of collaboration. Moreover, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, p. 87, § 37). The Court’s role is limited to verifying whether the interference which resulted from the applicants’ conviction of that offence can be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”.', '51. The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', 'In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicants and the context in which they made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many other authorities, the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, pp. 2547–48, § 51).', 'The Court must accordingly first examine the content of the remarks in issue and then determine whether it justified the applicants’ conviction, having regard to the fact that the State could have used means other than a criminal penalty (see, mutatis mutandis, the Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1256, § 44).', '52. With regard, firstly, to the content of the publication, the Court notes its unilateral character. Since the text presented Philippe Pétain in an entirely favourable light and did not mention any of the offences he had been accused of, and for which he had been sentenced to death by the High Court of Justice, it could without any doubt be regarded as polemical. In that connection, however, the Court reiterates that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 236, § 48).', 'The Court notes that the Paris Court of Appeal’s judgment convicting the applicants was mainly based on the fact that the authors of the text had not distanced themselves from or criticised certain aspects of Philippe Pétain’s conduct, and especially the fact that they had put nothing in the text about other events, particularly the signing “on 3 October 1940, [of] the so-called Act relating to aliens of Jewish race, who were later to be interned in camps set up in France for that purpose, in order to facilitate their conveyance to the Nazi concentration camps which were their intended destination”. The Court must accordingly consider whether these criticisms could justify the interference complained of.', '53. There is no doubt that, like any other remark directed against the Convention’s underlying values (see, mutatis mutandis, the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 25, § 35), the justification of a pro-Nazi policy could not be allowed to enjoy the protection afforded by Article 10. In the present case, however, the applicants explicitly stated their disapproval of “Nazi atrocities and persecutions” and of “German omnipotence and barbarism”. Thus they were not so much praising a policy as a man, and doing so for a purpose – namely securing revision of Philippe Pétain’s conviction – whose pertinence and legitimacy at least, if not the means employed to achieve it, were recognised by the Court of Appeal.', '54. As to the omissions for which the authors of the text were criticised, the Court does not intend to rule on them in the abstract. These were not omissions about facts of no consequence but about events directly linked with the Holocaust. Admittedly, the authors of the text did refer to “Nazi barbarism”, but without indicating that Philippe Pétain had knowingly contributed to it, particularly through his responsibility for the persecution and deportation to the death camps of tens of thousands of Jews in France. The gravity of these facts, which constitute crimes against humanity, increases the gravity of any attempt to draw a veil over them. Although it is morally reprehensible, however, the fact that the text made no mention of them must be assessed in the light of a number of other circumstances of the case.', '55. These include the fact that, as the Government observed, “this page of the history of France remains very painful in the collective memory, given the difficulties the country experienced in determining who was responsible, whether isolated individuals or entire institutions, for the policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany”.', 'In that connection it should be pointed out, however, that it was for the prosecution, whose role it is to represent all the sensibilities which make up the general interest and to assess the rights of others, to put that case during the domestic proceedings. But the prosecuting authorities first decided not to proceed with the case against the applicants in the Criminal Court (see paragraph 14 above), then refrained from appealing against the acquittal pronounced by that court (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above) and from appealing to the Court of Cassation against the Paris Court of Appeal’s judgment of 8 July 1987 (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).', 'The Court further notes that the events referred to in the publication in issue had occurred more than forty years before. Even though remarks like those the applicants made are always likely to reopen the controversy and bring back memories of past sufferings, the lapse of time makes it inappropriate to deal with such remarks, forty years on, with the same severity as ten or twenty years previously. That forms part of the efforts that every country must make to debate its own history openly and dispassionately. The Court reiterates in that connection that, subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, freedom of expression is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among many other authorities, the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 30, § 71, and the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 25, § 52).', '56. Furthermore, the publication in issue corresponds directly to the object of the associations which produced it, the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain and the National Pétain -Verdun Association. These associations are legally constituted and no proceedings have been brought against them, either before or after 1984, for pursuing their objects.', '57. Lastly, the Court notes the seriousness of a criminal conviction for publicly defending the crimes of collaboration, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal, particularly through civil remedies.', '58. In short, the Court considers the applicants’ criminal conviction disproportionate and, as such, unnecessary in a democratic society. There has therefore been a breach of Article 10.', 'Having reached that conclusion, the Court considers that it is not appropriate to apply Article 17.', 'II. application of Article 50 of the Convention', '59. Under Article 50 of the Convention,', '“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Damage and costs and expenses', '60. The applicants claimed one franc as symbolic compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In respect of the costs and expenses incurred as a result of the proceedings before the Convention institutions, they claimed 165,000 French francs (FRF), that is FRF 90,000 for lawyers’ fees and FRF 75,000 for research and documentation, journeys to London, reproduction costs and postal charges, journeys to Strasbourg and “various services”.', '61. The Delegate of the Commission submitted that the finding of a violation of Article 10 would constitute sufficient compensation for non-pecuniary damage.', '62. The Government also considered that, if the Court were to find a violation, the non-pecuniary damage would be sufficiently made good by that finding. As to costs and expenses, they left the matter to the Court’s discretion.', '63. The Court considers that the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants is sufficiently made good by the finding of a breach of Article 10. It assesses costs and expenses, on an equitable basis, at FRF 100,000.', 'B. Default interest', '64. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.36% per annum.']",2,fr,001-58245,1

He is a journalist and lives in Zduńska Wola, Poland.', '8. According to the applicant, on 2 September 1992 he noticed two municipal guards who were ordering street vendors to leave a square in Zduńska Wola where selling was allegedly not authorised by the municipal authorities and to move their makeshift stands to a nearby market-place. The Government maintain however that the guards, who were acting on sanitary and traffic considerations, merely requested the vendors to move to a nearby market-place. The applicant further submits that he intervened, informing the guards that their actions had no legal basis and infringed the laws guaranteeing freedom in the economic field. He pointed out that the municipal authorities had not passed any resolution which would allow the guards to clear the square. The applicant observed that the guards were apparently acting only on the basis of verbal instructions from the mayor and urged the vendors to stay. The exchange between the applicant and the guards was witnessed by a group of bystanders.', '9. Subsequently, on an unspecified date, the Zduńska Wola district prosecutor ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 5 January 1993 the district prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Zduńska Wola District Court ( Sąd Rejonowy ). The applicant was charged with having insulted municipal guards while they were carrying out their duties and with having acted with flagrant contempt for legal order, an offence specified in Article 236 of the Criminal Code read together with Article 59 § 1.', '10. On 29 April 1993 the District Court convicted the applicant under Article 236 of the Criminal Code of verbally insulting two municipal guards. It held that the offence was an act of hooliganism within the meaning of Article 59 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The applicant was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment suspended for two years and a fine of 1,500,000 old zlotys (PLZ). He was also ordered to pay the sum of PLZ 400,000 to charitable institutions and court costs of PLZ 346,000.', '11. On an unspecified date the applicant filed an appeal against this judgment, submitting that his conviction was based on insufficient evidence. He pointed out that the District Court had failed to establish precisely what defamatory words had been used and had only found that the applicant had called the guards “ignorant”. This word should not have been regarded as an insult but as an acceptable criticism of public servants. The applicant further contended that the trial court had wrongly applied the law since, contrary to its findings, it was evident that his acts had not involved any act of hooliganism as he had only intended to protect street vendors from illegal actions of the municipal guards.', '12. On 29 September 1993 the Sieradz Regional Court ( Sąd Wojewódzki ) quashed the part of the contested judgment relating to the sentence of imprisonment and the order to pay PLZ 400,000 to charitable institutions. However, it upheld the fine of PLZ 1,500,000 and reduced the court costs to the sum of PLZ 150,000. The Regional Court was of the opinion that the trial court had wrongly considered that the offence at issue had been hooligan in nature as the applicant’s motive had been to defend street vendors against the acts of the municipal guards which he had considered illegal. Therefore the applicant had not acted as he did without any justifiable motive, which was a prerequisite for finding that the offence was an act of hooliganism.', '13. Furthermore, the Regional Court agreed with the applicant that the Zduńska Wola municipal council had not passed any resolution prohibiting the sale of merchandise on the streets and that no public notice to this effect had been posted at the material place and time. Therefore, there were no grounds for the trial court’s finding that the applicant had demonstrated flagrant contempt for legal order.', '14. Finally, the Regional Court observed that the judgment had not mentioned the abusive words used by the applicant. Nevertheless, it considered that there was sufficient evidence in the case file to conclude that the applicant had in fact insulted the guards by calling them “oafs” and “dumb” (“ ćwoki ” and “ głupki ”). These words were widely considered to be offensive and by using them the applicant had exceeded the limits of freedom of expression. The court found that the resulting conviction was rightly imposed under Article 236 of the Criminal Code whose object was to ensure that civil servants were not hindered in carrying out their duties.']","['ii. relevant domestic law', '15. At the relevant time the legislation provided as follows:', 'Article 236 of the Criminal Code:', '“Anyone who insults a civil servant ... during and in connection with the carrying out of his official duties is liable to up to two years’ imprisonment, to restriction of personal liberty or to a fine.”', '“Kto znieważa funkcjonariusza publicznego … podczas i w związku z pełnieniem obowiązków służbowych, podlega karze pozbawienia wolności do lat 2, ograniczenia wolności albo grzywny.”', 'Article 59 § 1 of the Criminal Code:', '“If a perpetrator has committed a premeditated offence of a hooligan nature, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment not lower than one and a half times the minimum sentence provided ...”', '“Jeżeli sprawca dopuścił się umyślnego występku o charakterze chuligańskim, sąd wymierza karę pozbawienia wolności nie niższą od dolnego zagrożenia zwiększonego o połowę …”', 'Article 120 § 14 of the Criminal Code provided that an offence should be regarded as being of a hooligan nature if the perpetrator acted in public, without any justifiable motive or with an obviously unjustified one, thus demonstrating flagrant contempt for legal order.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '16. Mr Janowski applied to the Commission on 25 January 1994. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention, complaining that the Zduńska Wola District Court had refused to grant him legal aid and hear two defence witnesses and had produced minutes which did not reflect statements made by witnesses and the applicant during the hearing. He also complained under Article 10 that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression.', '17. The Commission declared the application (no. 25716/94) admissible on 27 November 1996 with the exception of the applicant’s complaints under Article 6. In its report of 3 December 1997 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed by eight votes to seven the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '18. The applicant in his memorial requested the Court to find that the facts of the case disclosed violations of Articles 3, 6, 7 § 1 and 10 of the Convention and to award him just satisfaction under former Article 50 (now Article 41).', 'The Government for their part requested the Court to find that Article 10 had not been violated in the present case.', 'THE LAW', 'i. scope of the case', '19. In his memorial to the Court the applicant raised several complaints under Articles 3, 6, 7 § 1 and 10 of the Convention. The Court observes that only the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression was declared admissible by the Commission (see paragraphs 16-17 above).', '20. The Court is therefore required to examine only the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 (see, mutatis mutandis, the McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, pp. 1354-55, §§ 68-70).', 'ii. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '21. Mr Janowski submitted that his conviction for insulting the municipal guards had infringed his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Commission agreed with the applicant’s arguments, whereas the Government contended that the facts of the case disclosed no breach of Article 10.', 'Existence of an interference', '22. The participants in the proceedings were agreed that the applicant’s conviction amounted to an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. The Court sees no cause to conclude otherwise.', '23. An interference contravenes Article 10 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such an aim or aims.', '“Prescribed by law”', '24. The Court considers, and indeed this was not disputed before it, that the interference was “prescribed by law”, the applicant’s conviction having been based on Article 236 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).', 'Legitimate aim', '25. The Commission, referring to the judgment of the appeal court, which explained that the purpose of the applicant’s conviction was to ensure that civil servants were not hindered in carrying out their duties, considered that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder (see paragraph 14 above). The Government agreed that the prevention of disorder was one of the legitimate aims pursued by the national authorities, but in addition pleaded the protection of the reputation and the rights of the municipal guards as the second legitimate aim.', '26. Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and to the reasoning of the appeal court’s judgment, the Court considers that the conviction of the applicant was intended to pursue the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder. The interference complained of therefore pursued a legitimate aim under Article 10 § 2.', 'D. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '1. Arguments before the Court', '27. The applicant submitted that his conviction for insulting the municipal guards did not constitute a necessary interference under paragraph 2 of Article 10. He pointed out that he had not intended to insult the guards but merely wanted to convey a message concerning the unlawfulness of their actions. Although the form of his message was strongly disapproving of the guards, the words he used should be considered appropriate. Furthermore, as the guards had acted unlawfully, they could not enjoy any special protection against criticism.', 'Finally, the applicant claimed that, since he was a journalist, his conviction was widely considered as an attempt by the authorities to restore censorship and constituted discouragement of the expression of criticism in future.', '28. The Commission considered that civil servants acting in an official capacity were, like politicians, subject to the wider limits of acceptable criticism. If they acted without a legal basis they should expect criticism from citizens and must accept that it may sometimes be harsh or expressed in a strong form. The applicant might have offended the guards by calling them “oafs” and “dumb”. However, in the particular circumstances of the case, namely the fact that he had spontaneously reacted to unjustified actions by the guards out of genuine civic considerations and expressed his criticism in the course of a heated exchange, he had not overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism. Furthermore, the Commission pointed out that the national authorities had convicted the applicant solely on the basis of the insulting meaning of the two words used by him without taking into account the situation which had provoked his reaction. It concluded that, as the applicant’s conviction was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and was not necessary in a democratic society, there had been a violation of Article 10.', 'The Delegate of the Commission added that in a democratic society citizens should be allowed to react to the conduct of civil servants even if their reactions were not justified and took controversial forms. Moreover, law-enforcement officers should be indifferent to offensive verbal responses to their actions since they constituted a part of their professional risk.', '29. The Government disagreed with the Commission’s opinion that civil servants acting in an official capacity were, like politicians, subject to the wider limits of acceptable criticism. Although they should be open to close scrutiny and criticism, they should at the same time enjoy protection against destructive attacks in order to be able to carry out their duties effectively. The Government further contested the Commission’s conclusion concerning the unlawfulness of the actions of the municipal guards, claiming that the latter had a right to instruct the street vendors to leave a square since they had acted on sanitary and traffic considerations (see paragraph 8 above). The criticism expressed by the applicant could not enjoy wider limits for it was not articulated through the media and was not a part of public debate on important issues. As the penalty imposed on the applicant had been proportionate to the aims pursued, the Government concluded by requesting the Court to find that there had been no violation of Article 10.', '2. The Court’s assessment', '(a) General principles', '30. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles which emerge from its judgments relating to Article 10:', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see the following judgments: Handyside v. theUnited Kingdom, 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49; Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 41; and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31).', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, p. 25, § 39).', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, pp. 25-26, § 40, and the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, § 28). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see the above-mentioned Jersild judgment, p. 24, § 31).', '(b) Application of the above principles to the instant case', '31. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court’s task is to determine whether, in all the circumstances, the restriction on Mr Janowski’s freedom of expression answered a “pressing social need” and was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities in justification of it were “relevant and sufficient”.', '32. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant was convicted of insulting the municipal guards by calling them “oafs” and “dumb” during an incident which took place in a square. It was witnessed by bystanders and concerned the actions of municipal guards who insisted that street vendors trading in the square move to another venue (see paragraph 8 above). The applicant’s remarks did not therefore form part of an open discussion of matters of public concern; neither did they involve the issue of freedom of the press since the applicant, although a journalist by profession, clearly acted as a private individual on this occasion. The Court further observesthat the applicant’s conviction was based on his utterance of the two words which were judged to be insulting by both trial and appeal courts, not the fact that he had expressed opinions critical of the guards or alleged that their actions were unlawful (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above).', 'In these circumstances the Court is not persuaded by the applicant’s contention that his conviction was widely considered as an attempt by the authorities to restore censorship and constituted discouragement of the expression of criticism in future (see paragraph 27 above).', '33. The Court also notes the Commission’s reasoning that civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to the wider limits of acceptable criticism (see paragraph 28 above). Admittedly those limits may in some circumstances be wider with regard to civil servants exercising their powers than in relation to private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions (cf. the Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2) judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1275, § 29).', 'What is more, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks when on duty. In the present case the requirements of such protection do not have to be weighed in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern since the applicant’s remarks were not uttered in such a context (see paragraph 32 above; and cf. the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, p. 26, § 42 in fine ).', '34. In the Court’s view, the reasons prompting the applicant’s conviction were relevant ones in terms of the legitimate aim pursued. It is true that the applicant resorted to abusive language out of genuine concern for the well-being of fellow citizens in the course of a heated discussion. This language was directed at law-enforcement officers who were trained how to respond to it. However, he insulted the guards in a public place, in front of a group of bystanders, while they were carrying out their duties. The actions of the guards, even though they were not based on the explicit regulations of the municipal council but on sanitary and traffic considerations, did not warrant resort to offensive and abusive verbal attacks (see paragraph 8 above). Consequently, even if there were some circumstances arguing the other way, sufficient grounds existed for the decision ultimately arrived at by the national courts.', '(c) Conclusion', '35. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court is satisfied that the reasons adduced by the national authorities were “relevant and sufficient” for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10. The Court further finds that, in the particular circumstances of the instant case, the resultant interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In this connection, it is noteworthy that the applicant’s sentence was substantially reduced on appeal and, most significantly, his prison sentence was quashed by the Sieradz Regional Court (see paragraph 12 above). In sum, it cannot be said that the national authorities overstepped the margin of appreciation available to them in assessing the necessity of the contested measure.', 'There has consequently been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention.']",1,pl,001-58909,0

Mr Roger Fressoz and Mr Claude Roire, who are French nationals, lived in Paris at the material time. Mr Fressoz was born in 1921 and is a former publishing director of the weekly satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné. Mr Roire was born in 1939 and is a journalist on Le Canard enchaîné.', 'A. The article at the heart of the case', ""9. September 1989 was a period of industrial unrest within the Peugeot motor company. The workforce's demands included pay rises, which the management, led by the company chairman and managing director Mr Jacques Calvet, refused to award."", '10. On 27 September 1989, Le Canard enchaîné published an article by Mr Roire under the headline:', '“Calvet turbo-charges his salary”', 'with the subhead:', '“His tax forms reveal more than he does. The Peugeot boss has given himself a 45.9% rise over the last two years.”', 'The article itself included the following:', ""“When Jacques Calvet appeared on the Antenne 2 programme'L'heure de vérité'in October 1988, he refused to answer a question about his pay. This is seen as a public-relations blunder on the part of the Peugeot boss, but the Canard is now in a position to put it right, thanks to the famous M.D.'s three most recent tax-assessment forms, which have come into our hands by chance. At the time of the broadcast, he was earning 185,312 francs net per month."", ""These documents show that, between 1986 and 1988, Calvet's total salary (plus benefits in kind and sickness benefit) rose by 45.9%. According to Peugeot's own figures, the average pay of the group's 158,000 workers rose by 6.7% over the same two years – in other words, almost seven times less than the boss's."", ""M.D.'s blues"", ""Calvet has turned Peugeot around in spectacular style, but in a recent interview on Antenne 2 he said he was under stress due to his group's position in the face of the Japanese offensive. It would appear that this painful psychological crisis has not prevented him from swelling his income – though it should be noted that Calvet is far from Number 1 in the hit-parade of chief executives' salaries."", ""In 1987 he awarded himself a 17% increase in his annual pay, bringing it to 1,786,171 francs – that is, 148,847 francs a month. Why? Probably because the Revenue had grabbed a big slice of his previous year's income. And this dreadful tax-pay spiral continued its destructive course the following year. In 1988, in order to scrape by, Calvet was forced to give himself another rise, of 24%. His salary that year came to 2,223,747 francs, i.e. 185,312 francs a month after deductions ...”"", ""The article was illustrated by a box reproducing a photocopy of that part of each of the three notices of assessment to tax which detailed Mr Calvet's “total taxable income” and showed the amounts he had received by way of “salary, benefits in kind and sickness benefit”. Each of the three totals was circled in pencil."", 'B. The criminal proceedings against the applicants', '1. The investigative stage', '11. On 2 October 1989 Mr Calvet lodged a criminal complaint against a person or persons unknown, together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages, with the senior investigating judge at Paris tribunal de grande instance. He submitted that the events in question must have involved the unlawful removal and possession of the originals or copies of documents normally held by the tax authorities and amounted to the offences of misappropriation of deeds or documents by a public servant, breach of professional confidence, misappropriation of documents for the time needed to reproduce them and handling unlawfully obtained documents.', '12. On 5 October 1989 the public prosecutor applied to the investigating judge for an investigation to be opened into allegations of theft, breach of professional confidence, unlawful removal of deeds or documents by a public servant and handling unlawfully obtained goods.', '13. On 25 October 1989 the Minister for the Budget also lodged a criminal complaint, together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party claiming damages, against a person or persons unknown for unlawful removal of government documents and breach of professional confidence. On 11 December 1989 the public prosecutor requested that a further investigation be opened.', ""14. In the course of the investigation, an analysis of the computer reference number on the copy documents in Mr Roire's possession revealed that they were photocopies of the part of the tax-assessment notice which is kept by the tax authorities and is not intended to leave their premises. An inspection of the premises confirmed that the locks on the cabinets containing the documents had not been forced and that the alarm protecting the premises outside working hours had not been activated."", ""An examination of the original of Mr Calvet's tax assessment for 1988 revealed a palm-print belonging to the Divisional Director of Taxes. However, it was asserted that this person had called up the relevant tax file on 27 September 1989 at the request of the Head of the Revenue and the Director of Taxes for the département. The person or persons responsible for unlawfully removing the document from the tax authorities' premises could not be identified, with the result that no one was ever charged under that head."", '15. On 8 March 1991 the applicants were charged with handling copies of notices of assessment to tax obtained through a breach of professional confidence, unlawful removal of deeds or documents and theft.', ""16. On 20 December 1991 the public prosecutor filed a report recommending that no one should be charged with the offences of theft or breach of professional confidence, that all the charges against the first applicant should be dropped and that the second applicant should be committed for trial before the Criminal Court on charges of handling photocopies of Mr Calvet's tax assessments obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official."", ""17. On 27 January 1992 the investigating judge ordered that, as no culprit had been identified, the proceedings for theft and breach of professional confidence should be discontinued. The judge committed both applicants for trial before the Criminal Court on charges of handling confidential information concerning Mr Calvet's income obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official and of handling stolen photocopies of Mr Calvet's tax assessments."", '2. In Paris Criminal Court', '18. The applicants submitted two arguments in their defence: first, that the conditions for publishing directors to be criminally liable, laid down in section 42 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 (see paragraph 25 below) did not apply and, second, that the elements of the offences with which they had been charged, as defined in Article 460 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 27 below), were not made out in their case.', '19. At the trial Mr Fressoz stated that the first time he had seen the extracts from the tax assessments printed in the newspaper was when he looked at the proofs before personally passing the article for press. He said he had asked Mr Roire “whether his documents were sound in journalistic terms”, that is to say, “whether the information was accurate and had been checked”. He acknowledged that, as a general rule, passing copy for press was the responsibility of an editorial assistant, who, “if there is a problem, consults the editor and, in the last resort, the publishing director”.', ""The second applicant stated that the photocopies of the tax assessments had been sent anonymously in an envelope addressed to him by name, about a fortnight before they were used in the paper. He explained that he had “checked the plausibility” of the information in the documents, in particular by looking up the level of Mr Calvet's remuneration in specialist works including Fortune France. He said that he had also checked with various persons to ensure that the documents were photocopies of “genuine” tax-assessment notices. He specified that he had also verified that they really were tax-authority documents, adding that once it appeared that there was no proof that they had been obtained unlawfully, “the overriding consideration was the documents' significance”."", '20. In a judgment of 17 June 1992, Paris Criminal Court acquitted the applicants, holding that the principal offences of theft and breach of professional confidence had not been made out because it had proved impossible to identify who had disclosed the documents or to establish the circumstances in which the offences had been committed.', 'In relation to the offence of breach of professional confidence, the court held as follows:', '“ ...', ""In the instant case, while it has been established that the originals of the documents in question are notices of assessment to tax held on Mr Calvet's tax file, it cannot be inferred from this that the person guilty of wrongfully taking them for the time needed to photocopy them, or of disclosing them to third parties, or of divulging the information contained in them, necessarily fell within one of the categories of person defined in the above-mentioned provision [Article L. 103 of the Code of Tax Procedure]; since the tax authorities themselves have suggested that the perpetrator might be 'someone from outside' ... – whatever the security regulations at the time."", 'The fact that the status and professional functions of the person responsible for the disclosure are unknown therefore rules out any possibility of proving one of the essential elements of the offence of breach of professional confidence.', 'Consequently, there is no formal proof that this offence was committed, so that the charge against the defendants of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence has not been made out ...”', 'In relation to the theft charge, the court held:', '“... In particular, it has not been shown that the person who originally copied the documents had any unlawful intention or had such an intention at the time of taking the documents.', ""Hence, without further rehearsing the numerous questions remaining unanswered concerning how these documents found their way into Mr Roire's hands, we find that the elements of the offence of theft have not been sufficiently proved."", 'Unless it can be precisely established that, in the first place, an act defined as a serious crime ( crime ) or other major offence ( délit ) was committed, and its elements can be made out, the prerequisite for an offence of handling is lacking, and the defendant must be acquitted.”', '21. On 25 and 26 June 1992 respectively, the public prosecutor and the civil parties claiming damages appealed.', '3. In Paris Court of Appeal', ""22. In a judgment of 10 March 1993, Paris Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and found the applicants guilty of handling photocopies of Mr Calvet's tax returns obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official. Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire were sentenced to, respectively, fines of 10,000 and 5,000 French francs (FRF) and ordered, jointly and severally, to pay Mr Calvet FRF 1 by way of damages for non-pecuniary damage and FRF 10,000 by way of reimbursement of legal costs under Article 475-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."", 'The Court of Appeal held as follows:', ""“This Court cannot agree with the manner in which the court below analysed the facts. The results of the investigations show that only a tax official familiar with the department could have leaked the documents, since no outside party had requested Jacques Calvet's file and that file was found, on the morning of 27 September 1989, in its normal condition, with the documents filed according to the particular practice of Chaillot Tax Office. It is certain that a third party, someone who was not a civil servant or was from outside the tax department, could not – without attracting attention – have taken documents filed in two separate places in the file, photographed or photocopied them and put them back in exactly the right place, given that the file is kept in a metal cabinet in a locked room to which there is access only for authorised persons."", 'Contrary to the court below, we therefore hold that, in this case, it has been established that the offence of breach of professional confidence was committed, and that the fact that the culprit has not been identified is irrelevant.', ""Mr Roire told the investigating judge that the photocopies of Jacques Calvet's tax notices were sent to him anonymously at the newspaper, in an envelope addressed to him personally. He confirmed that he had questioned various people in order to ensure that they were indeed copies of genuine tax documents."", ""Mr Roire's article, containing a reproduction of the documents in question, was submitted to Roger Fressoz, the publishing director of Le Canard enchaîné, who, personally, passed it for press."", ""Mr Fressoz told the investigating judge that he saw the extracts from Jacques Calvet's tax notices at that point. He explained that – as a general rule – copy is passed for press by the senior editorial assistant, who, if there is a problem, consults the editor and, in the last resort, himself."", 'The offence of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence was characterised, in the instant case, by the publication of documents obtained in breach of the provisions of Article L. 103 of the Code of Tax Procedure and Article 378 of the Criminal Code and was committed by Mr Roire and Mr Fressoz given that, in the light of the nature of the documents and of the checks which Mr Roire says he carried out, the defendants must have known that those documents came from a tax file. Moreover, this explains why the article was passed for press by Mr Fressoz, the publishing director, and not an editorial assistant or the editor. It is worth recalling that, although Mr Fressoz was not the person to whom the documents were sent, he saw them before giving his authorisation to publish the article reproducing extracts from them. Therefore, both the actus reus and the mens rea of the offence of handling the fruits of a breach of professional confidence are present in his case as well as in that of the author of the article, Mr Roire ...”', '4. In the Court of Cassation', ""23. Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire appealed to the Court of Cassation on points of law. In their grounds of appeal (and subsequently in a reply to Mr Calvet's pleadings), they submitted two arguments."", 'As the first ground of appeal, Mr Fressoz argued that, since he was a publishing director as defined in the Act of 29 July 1881, the lower courts were not empowered to convict him of a handling offence under the general criminal law, but only of one of the offences specially defined in that Act. In his reply, he pointed out that the other side was confusing “handling” with “publishing”, submitting that Mr Calvet was concerned, not by the handling but by the publication – something which did not contravene any provision of the press laws, so that the prosecution had resorted to another, inappropriate, charge, that of handling.', ""As the second ground, both applicants argued that the elements of the offence with which they had been charged, as defined in the relevant domestic law, including sections 5, 6 and 42 of the 1881 Act, were not made out in their case. On that point, they maintained that Mr Calvet's tax assessments were not covered by a duty to preserve confidentiality – so that there could have been no breach of such a duty – but contained information which was available to the public. They argued that a journalist could not lawfully be convicted of “handling information” and submitted that the Court of Appeal had failed to demonstrate how the actus reus and mens rea of the offence with which they had been charged – namely possession or control of the thing in question and knowledge that it had been obtained unlawfully – were made out in their case. With regard to the fact that the Court of Appeal had deduced that Mr Roire must have known that the documents had been obtained unlawfully since, when he had received them, he had verified that they were indeed copies of tax assessments, Mr Roire submitted that he had “merely fulfilled his duty as a journalist: before publishing information, he had checked that it was genuine, as required by the obligation on all journalists to exercise caution and verify sources”."", '24. The Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on 3 April 1995, holding as follows:', '“ ...', ""The grounds [of the Court of Appeal's judgment], following as they do from findings of fact which are not subject to review by this Court, show that the appellate court, having established that the defendants knowingly had in their possession or control documents obtained through a breach of professional confidence, contrary to Article L. 103 of the Code of Tax Procedure, did not misdirect themselves in law as alleged [by the appellants]."", 'In particular, the Court of Appeal cannot be held to have misinterpreted Article 460 of the Criminal Code as it stood at the time, in which the only offence defined is that of handling stolen goods, since, although it found the applicants guilty of handling unlawfully obtained photocopies, it rightly dismissed the charge of handling unlawfully obtained information on which the journalists were committed for trial before the Criminal Court.', 'Information, whatever its nature or source, is covered neither by Article 460 nor by Article 321-1 of the Criminal Code which came into force on 1 March 1994, so that, if a problem arose – that is, if certain information were published and that publication were challenged by the persons concerned – the only legal provisions governing it would be those specifically concerning the freedom of the press or of audiovisual communication ...”']","['ii. Relevant Domestic Law', 'A. Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881', '25. The relevant sections of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 provide as follows:', 'Section 1', '“Anyone may print or sell books and other publications”.', 'Section 5', '“Any newspaper or periodical may be published without prior authorisation or the payment of any security, provided that the declaration required by section 7 has been made”.', 'Section 6', '“All press publications must have a publishing director ...”', 'Section 42', '“The following persons shall be liable, as principals and in the following order, to penalties for serious crimes ( crimes ) or other major offences ( délits ) committed through the press:', '(1) publishing directors or publishers, whatever their profession or title and, in the circumstances defined in section 6(2), joint publishing directors;', '(2) in the absence of any of the foregoing, the actual offenders;', '...”', 'B. The Code of Tax Procedure', '26. The relevant Articles of the Code of Tax Procedure provide as follows:', 'Article L. 103', '“The duty to preserve professional confidentiality, as defined in Article 378 of the Criminal Code, applies to any person who is required, in the course of his duties or exercise of his powers, to take any action concerning the assessment, inspection or recovery of, or disputes over, any taxes, duties, imposts or levies referred to in the General Tax Code.

The Criminal Code', '27. At the material time, Article 460 of the Criminal Code provided:', ""“Anyone who knowingly handles any goods (or any part thereof) taken, misappropriated or obtained by means of a serious crime ( crime ) or other major offence ( délit ) shall be liable to between three months' and five years' imprisonment or a fine of between FRF 10,000 and FRF 2,500,000 or both. The amount of the fine may be increased to a sum exceeding FRF 2,500,000 but not exceeding half the value of the goods handled ...”"", 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '28. Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire applied to the Commission on 3 August 1995. They asserted that their conviction by the Court of Appeal constituted a breach of their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. They also complained that the principle of the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 had been violated in their case.', ""29. The Commission declared the application (no. 29183/95) admissible on 26 May 1997. In its report of 13 January 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (twenty-one votes to eleven) and that no separate issue arose under Article 6 § 2 (eighteen votes to fourteen). The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [3]."", 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', ""30. In their memorial, the Government asked the Court to dismiss Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire's application as inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies or, in the alternative, to hold that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention. With regard to the complaint under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, they requested the Court to dismiss it as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention or, in the alternative, to hold that Article 6 § 2 had not been violated."", '31. The applicants asked the Court to find that Articles 10 and 6 § 2 had been violated and to afford them just satisfaction.', 'THE LAW', 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 of the convention', '32. The applicants submitted that their conviction by the Paris Court of Appeal had infringed Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ...', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'The Government contested that submission; the Commission agreed with it.', ""A. The Government's preliminary objection"", '33. As they had done before the Commission, the Government pleaded failure to exhaust domestic remedies. Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire had confined themselves to denying the charge of handling stolen goods that had been brought against them. At no stage, not even as an alternative submission, had they sought to argue that there was a contradiction between the charges on which they had been found guilty and the principle of freedom of expression. Thus, they had not complained, either expressly or in substance, of a breach of Article 10 of the Convention before the domestic courts even though they might have succeeded on that point of law, which had been admissible before the national courts. They had accordingly failed to afford the French courts an opportunity to decide whether the criminal proceedings that had been brought against them were compatible with the principle of freedom of expression. Consequently, domestic remedies had not been exhausted and the Court, consistent with its decision in the Ahmet Sadık v. Greece case (see the judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1654, §§ 32-33), was unable to hear the case.', ""34. The applicants replied that they had raised in substance the complaint of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention before the Court of Cassation, as their pleadings before that court showed (see paragraph 23 above). After referring to the Act of 29 July 1881, which established the principle of freedom of the press, they had argued, firstly, that Mr Calvet's tax assessments were not confidential as they were available to the public and, secondly, that they could not in law be guilty of “handling information”. In any event, arguing that there had been a breach of Article 10 would not have prevented the ordinary rules of law governing the handling of stolen goods taking precedence over the protection of freedom of expression."", ""35. In its decision on the admissibility of the application, the Commission dismissed the objection on the ground that the applicants had made a complaint before the Court of Cassation that was in substance connected with a breach of Article 10. The Delegate of the Commission in addition maintained before the Court that, as the Court of Cassation's powers had been limited (it could not have reopened the Court of Appeal's findings of fact), it was unlikely that redress for the alleged violation would have been obtained through an appeal on points of law. In his opinion, there would have been little point in the applicants' asserting their right to freedom of expression when dissemination of the information did not give rise to a risk of conviction under the general law."", '36. Article 35 § 1, formerly Article 26, of the Convention reads as follows:', '“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”', '37. The Court reiterates that the purpose of the rule referred to above is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right – usually through the courts – the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court. That rule must be applied “with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism”; it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently in Strasbourg should have been raised, “at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law”, before the national authorities (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, § 27, and the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp. 1210-11, §§ 65-69).', ""38. The applicants are engaged in the business of disseminating information and were convicted after publishing documents. In the Court of Cassation the applicants relied on various provisions of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881, which, so far as the applicants' activities are concerned, contains provisions equivalent to those of Article 10. In their pleadings in support of their appeal to that court, the applicants argued that their article had not contravened any provision of the Freedom of the Press Act and that, as a journalist, Mr Roire had simply been doing his “duty” (see paragraph 23 above). In their pleading in reply, the applicants criticised the prosecution for confusing “handling” with “publication” saying that they had been charged with handling so that they could be prosecuted under the general law rather than under the special provisions governing the media (see paragraph 23 above). Indeed, by making a distinction in its judgment between the law applicable to the information itself and the law applicable to the document in which it was contained, the Court of Cassation indirectly ruled on the scope of journalists' rights to information."", ""39. In these circumstances, the Court holds that freedom of expression was in issue, if only implicitly, in the proceedings before the Court of Cassation and that the legal arguments made by the applicants' in that court included a complaint connected with Article 10 of the Convention."", ""The applicants' complaint under Article 10 of the Convention was thus raised, at least in substance, before the Court of Cassation. The Government's objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed."", 'B. The merits of the complaint', '40. The applicants submitted that their conviction for handling photocopies of tax returns obtained through a breach of professional confidence by an unidentified tax official had infringed their right to freedom of expression.', ""41. The applicants' conviction was an “interference” with the exercise of their right to freedom of expression. Such interference breaches Article 10 unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” to attain such aim or aims."", '1. “Prescribed by law”', '42. Those appearing before the Court agreed that the interference was “prescribed by law”, namely Article 460 of the former Criminal Code and Article L. 103 of the Code of Tax Procedure. The Court shares that view.', '2. Legitimate aims', '43. According to the applicants, the Government and the Commission, the interference was intended to protect the reputation or rights of others and to prevent the disclosure of information received in confidence. The Court sees no reason to conclude otherwise.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '44. The Court must therefore consider whether the interference was “necessary” in a democratic society in order to achieve those aims.', '(a) General principles', '45. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles under its case-law concerning Article 10.', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49, and the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 37).', '(ii) The press plays an essential role in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38).', '(iii) As a matter of general principle, the “necessity” for any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established. Admittedly, it is in the first place for the national authorities to assess whether there is a “pressing social need” for the restriction and, in making their assessment, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. In cases, such as the present one, concerning the press, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press. Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10, whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, pp. 500-01, § 40, and the Worm v. Austria judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, p. 1551, § 47).', ""(iv) The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, the Court must look at the “interference” complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, among many other authorities, the Goodwin judgment cited above, pp. 500-01, § 40)."", '(b) Application of the above principles to the present case', ""46. Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire said that their article had been published in the context of a public debate of general interest to which changes in Mr Calvet's earnings were, at the time, of particular relevance. The article was intended to contribute to a debate that went beyond the Peugeot chairman as an individual, since his importance, his role, the scale of the industrial dispute and the size of the company concerned were all matters lending themselves to discussion. The published article did not therefore concern Mr Calvet's reputation or rights, but the management of the company he ran."", ""The penalty imposed on them was all the more unjust in that, under the Court of Cassation's case-law, publishing details of a person's income or assets did not constitute an interference with his private life, especially if he exercised public or quasi-public functions."", ""Nor had the penalty been necessary to secure compliance with the duty to preserve confidentiality. In the instant case only the tax officials had been subject to confidentiality obligations. Other people, such as members of the works' council or of Mr Calvet's family, could have disclosed the information about his income. In any event, Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire could not have known that the photocopies of the tax assessments sent to them anonymously had been obtained through a breach of professional confidence, as the national courts themselves had been unable to establish such a breach, despite a two-year investigation."", 'By publishing part of the photocopied documents the applicants had been able to show that their information was true and fulfil their duty as journalists to communicate data that had been verified and proof.', 'Lastly, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation was transparently artificial and its pernicious effects on freedom of the press immediate. Mr Calvet had complained solely because his income had been disclosed. The fact that the applicants had been convicted of the purely technical offence of handling photocopies disguised what was really a desire to penalise them for publishing the information, although publication in itself was quite lawful.', '47. The Commission agreed in substance with those submissions.', ""48. The Government maintained that it was the breach of confidence regarding tax matters that had led to the applicants' conviction and that conviction had been necessary to secure effective preservation of confidentiality. It would be unrealistic to hope to secure compliance with a duty to preserve confidentiality if any information, including information that was to remain confidential, could be disclosed with impunity. Restrictions on freedom of expression were to be assessed in the light of the responsibilities and obligations of those concerned when the information was obtained. The addressees of the letter must have been aware that the documents had been obtained unlawfully. Indeed, the second applicant had not disputed knowing that the documents came from a tax file and should therefore have treated them as confidential."", 'Furthermore, disclosing the remuneration of just one person, albeit the head of a major private company, did not contribute to the debate on a topic of interest to the public. The published information concerned a particular situation that was too specific to be a matter of public interest. It had been published solely with a view to damaging Mr Calvet and putting him in a difficult position in the pay negotiations that were under way.', ""French law made it possible for citizens to obtain information concerning the income and the tax liabilities of taxpayers in France. Thus under Article L. 111 of the Code of Tax Procedure (see paragraph 26 above) taxpayers in a municipality were entitled to consult a list of the people liable for tax and to find out those people's taxable income and tax liability."", ""In any event, there could not have been a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression as an alternative solution had been available that would have allowed any right the public had to information to be upheld, without the commission of a criminal offence. The applicants would not have been guilty of the offence of handling photocopies if they had confined themselves to publishing the information about Mr Calvet's income, without reproducing extracts from the photocopies of the tax assessments that had been sent to them by a person who was rightfully subject to professional confidentiality obligations. Admittedly, proceedings could have been brought against them for press libel. However, the case-law of the Court of Cassation established that journalists were entitled to adduce evidence justifying their assertions, even if obtained unlawfully. Subject to that condition, the applicants could have disclosed the information without restriction."", ""49. In the light of those arguments, the Court must examine whether relevant and sufficient reasons existed to justify the applicants' conviction for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10."", ""50. The Court is unconvinced by the Government's argument that the information was not a matter of general interest. The article was published during an industrial dispute – widely reported in the press – at one of the major French car manufacturers. The workers were seeking a pay rise which the management were refusing. The article showed that the company chairman had received large pay increases during the period under consideration while at the same time opposing his employees' claims for a rise. By making such a comparison against that background, the article contributed to a public debate on a matter of general interest. It was not intended to damage Mr Calvet's reputation but to contribute to the more general debate on a topic that interested the public (see, for example, the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 28, § 66)."", 'The Court of Cassation has held that questions relating to the finances of public figures, such as heads of major companies, do not concern their private life. That is not something the Government disputed.', '51. Not only does the press have the task of imparting information and ideas on matters of public interest: the public also has a right to receive them (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, § 59; Jersild, cited above, p. 23, § 31; and De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, p. 234, § 39). That is particularly true in the instant case, as issues concerning employment and pay generally attract considerable attention. Consequently, an interference with the exercise of press freedom cannot be compatible with Article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest (see the Goodwin judgment cited above, p. 500, § 39).', ""52. Admittedly, people exercising freedom of expression, including journalists, undertake “duties and responsibilities” the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical means they use (see, mutatis mutandis, the Handyside judgment cited above, p. 23, § 49 in fine ). In the present case the Court of Appeal held that in the light of the nature of the documents and of the checks which Mr Roire says he carried out, the defendants must have known that the documents came from a tax file (see paragraph 22 above) and were therefore confidential. While recognising the vital role played by the press in a democratic society, the Court stresses that journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that Article 10 affords them protection. Indeed, paragraph 2 of Article 10 defines the boundaries of the exercise of freedom of expression. It falls to be decided whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, the interest in the public's being informed outweighed the “duties and responsibilities” the applicants had as a result of the suspect origin of the documents that were sent to them."", ""53. The Court must in particular determine whether the objective of protecting fiscal confidentiality, which in itself is legitimate, constituted a relevant and sufficient justification for the interference. In that connection, it must be noted that although the applicants' conviction was based solely on the reproduction in Le Canard enchaîné of documents in the possession of the tax authorities that were held to have been communicated to Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire in breach of professional confidence, it inevitably concerned the disclosure of information. The issue does however arise as to whether there was any need to prevent the disclosure of information that was already available to the public (see the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 23, § 51, and the Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the Netherlands judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 306-A, p. 15, § 41) and might already have been known to a large number of people. As the Government accepted, a degree of transparency exists regarding earnings and pay rises. Thus local taxpayers may consult a list of the people liable for tax in their municipality, with details of each taxpayer's taxable income and tax liability (see paragraphs 26 and 48 above). While that information cannot be disseminated, it is thus accessible to a large number of people who may in turn pass it on to others. Although publication of the tax assessments in the present case was prohibited, the information they contained was not confidential. Indeed, the remuneration of people who, like Mr Calvet, run major companies is regularly published in financial reviews and the second applicant said, without it being disputed, that he had referred to information of that type in order to check roughly how much Mr Calvet was earning (see paragraph 19 above). Accordingly, there was no overriding requirement for the information to be protected as confidential."", ""54. If, as the Government accepted, the information about Mr Calvet's annual income was lawful and its disclosure permitted, the applicants' conviction merely for having published the documents in which that information was contained, namely the tax assessments, cannot be justified under Article 10. In essence, that Article leaves it for journalists to decide whether or not it is necessary to reproduce such documents to ensure credibility. It protects journalists' right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, in particular, the Goodwin judgment cited above, p. 500, § 39; the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, p. 34, § 34; and, as an example of a finding to the contrary on the facts, the Prager and Oberschlick judgment cited above, p. 18, § 37)."", ""55. In the instant case, the Court notes that neither Mr Fressoz and Mr Roire's account of the events nor their good faith has been called into question. Mr Roire, who verified the authenticity of the tax assessments, acted in accordance with the standards governing his profession as a journalist. The extracts from each document were intended to corroborate the terms of the article in question. The publication of the tax assessments was thus relevant not only to the subject matter but also to the credibility of the information supplied."", ""56. In sum, there was not, in the Court's view, a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the journalists' conviction and the means deployed to achieve that aim, given the interest a democratic society has in ensuring and preserving freedom of the press. There has therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention."", 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 2 of the convention', '57. The applicants complained of two breaches of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, which provides:', '“Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.”', ""The national courts had failed to apply the presumption of innocence in two respects. Firstly, Mr Fressoz's conviction had resulted from an unwarranted extension to the special criminal-law system created by the Act of 29 July 1881 (see paragraph 25 above) that rendered publishing directors strictly liable for press offences. Secondly, the applicants should not have been convicted of an offence under the general law as there was no concrete evidence against them. In order to be able to convict, the Court of Appeal had had to resort to a purely hypothetical intellectual construction whereby the applicants were presumed to have known the fraudulent origin of the photocopies they had received."", '58. The Government submitted that this complaint was incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. What the applicants were in fact seeking to do was to challenge the merits of their conviction by the Court of Appeal. However, it was not for the Convention institutions to determine whether the national courts had correctly assessed the evidence. In any event, there had been no presumption of guilt against the journalists in the Court of Appeal, which had given perfectly valid reasons for its decision.', '59. Having heard the arguments made before it and in view of its conclusion that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, the Commission considered that the complaint under Article 6 § 2 arose out of the same facts and did not give rise to any issues of fact or law requiring separate examination.', '60. The Court reaches the same conclusion and considers that, in the light of its finding in paragraph 56 and the matters it took into account in so finding, no separate issue arises under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.', 'III. application of article 41 of the convention', '61. Article 41 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Damage', '62. The applicants considered that a finding by the Court that there had been a violation of the Convention would constitute just satisfaction. They claimed, however, reimbursement of the sum of 10,001 French francs (FRF) which the Court of Appeal had ordered them to pay Mr Calvet for non-pecuniary damage (one franc) and, under Article 475-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for the costs incurred in the proceedings (see paragraph 22 above).', ""63. The Government submitted that the latter claim for reimbursement could not be allowed since the applicants had not pointed to any particular pecuniary damage under that head and, in addition, an award would cast doubt on the binding nature of the Court of Appeal's decision. As to the remainder, a finding of a violation would in itself constitute just satisfaction."", '64. The Delegate of the Commission did not make any observations on the subject.', '65. The Court finds that there is a causal link between the payment of FRF 10,001 awarded to Mr Calvet and the violation of Article 10 which it has found, such that the applicants should recover that sum. It is therefore appropriate to award the amount claimed. That apart, the finding of a breach made in this judgment constitutes just satisfaction for any other damage.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '66. The journalists claimed FRF 166,100 for the costs and expenses incurred in order to be represented. They apportioned the sum as follows: FRF 55,800 for the proceedings before the domestic courts, including FRF 12,000 for the proceedings in the Court of Cassation, and FRF 110,300 for the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions.', '67. The Delegate of the Commission made no observations.', '68. The Government contended that they should not have to bear the costs of the domestic proceedings as the complaint under Article 10 of the Convention had not been made at that stage. They should only be liable to reimburse costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Convention institutions and their liability should not exceed FRF 40,000, regard being had to the amounts generally awarded by the Court in the past.', '69. On the basis of the information it has before it, the Court, ruling on an equitable basis, awards the applicants FRF 60,000.', 'C. Default interest', '70. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.36% per annum.']",1,fr,001-58906,1

He alleged that the prohibitions contained in Article 40/B § 4 of the Hungarian Constitution infringed his rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention taken either alone or together with Article 14.', '22. The Commission declared the application (no. 25390/94) admissible on 11 April 1997. In its report of 9 July 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (twenty-one votes to nine); that there had been no violation of Article 11 (twenty-one votes to nine); that it was not necessary to examine the applicant’s complaint under Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 10 (twenty-five votes to five) and that there had been no violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 11 (twenty-two votes to eight). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the four partly dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [6].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '23. The applicant requested the Court in his memorial to find the respondent State in breach of its obligations under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention taken either alone or together with Article 14 and to award him just satisfaction under Article 41.', 'The Government, for their part, invited the Court to reject the applicant’s complaints under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention both taken alone and together with Article 14.', 'THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention', '24. The applicant maintained that the prohibition on engaging in “political activities” contained in Article 40/B § 4 of the Hungarian Constitution amounted to an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression, in violation of Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '25. The Commission arrived at the same conclusion, finding that the impugned prohibition was vague and sweeping, and could not, therefore, be regarded as being “prescribed by law” as required by paragraph 2 of Article 10.', 'The Government did not dispute that the applicant could rely on the guarantees contained in Article 10; nor did they deny that the prohibition interfered with the exercise of his rights under that Article. They contended, however, that the interference was justified under the second paragraph of Article 10.', 'A. As to the applicability of Article 10 and the existence of an interference', '26. The Court takes it for granted that the pursuit of activities of a political nature comes within the ambit of Article 10 in so far as freedom of political debate constitutes a particular aspect of freedom of expression. Indeed, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 42). Furthermore, the guarantees contained in Article 10 of the Convention extend to military personnel and civil servants (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 41-42, § 100; and the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 22-23, § 43). The Court sees no reason to come to a different conclusion in respect of police officers and this has not been disputed by those appearing before the Court.', 'Nor has it been contested that the prohibition, by curtailing the applicant’s involvement in political activities, interfered with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. The Court for its part also finds that there has been an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression.', 'B. As to whether the interference was justified', '27. Such an interference gives rise to a breach of Article 10 unless it can be shown that it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aim or aims as defined in paragraph 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” to attain them.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '(a) Submissions of those appearing before the Court', '(i) The applicant', '28. The applicant submitted that the prohibition at issue was of an unacceptably general character and was open to arbitrary interpretations. A general constitutional ban on political activities contradicted any legislation of a lower level permitting certain activities of a political nature. Since the notion of “political activities” was not defined in any Hungarian law, it was not foreseeable whether or not a certain activity fell under the prohibition. This legal situation had prevailed without interruption since 1 January 1994 and had not been rectified by any subsequent legislation, including the 1994 Police Act.', '(ii) The Government', '29. In the proceedings before the Commission, the Government argued that the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations had provided a legal framework detailed enough to define the restrictions on political activities by police officers in a manner compatible with Article 10 § 2.', '30. In their pleadings before the Court, the Government relied on Article 78 of the Hungarian Constitution (see paragraph 13 above) as regards the alleged contradiction between the constitutional restriction and the permissive legislation of a lower level and explained that the two were not in conflict but complemented each other. They maintained that in the Hungarian legal system it was the practice that certain provisions of the Constitution could properly be interpreted only if read together with legislation of a lower level completing and explaining their precise content. Contemporary legislative techniques often left it to laws lower in the hierarchy to define general notions used in higher laws – a law-making method not uncommon at least in continental legal systems and never in principle disapproved by the Convention organs. In any event, the Constitutional Court had the competence to rule on any potential contradiction between the Constitution and other legislation.', '31. Furthermore, the legislation in force both prior and subsequent to the adoption of the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations met the requirements of foreseeability, the latter two instruments having merely recodified provisions already in force. Therefore, the constitutional restriction in question was “prescribed by law” at all times subsequent to its entry into force. Prior to 1 October 1994, the conditions governing various activities of a political nature, whereby police officers have always been permitted to exercise certain rights relating to freedom of expression, were laid down, inter alia, in Law no. 34 of 1989 on parliamentary elections, Law no. 55 of 1990 on the legal status of members of Parliament, Law no. 64 of 1990 on the election of members of local authorities and mayors, and Law no. 17 of 1989 on referenda (the right to collect “nomination coupons”, expound election programmes, promote candidates, organise election campaign meetings, nominate candidates, vote in and stand for elections to Parliament, local authorities and the office of mayor and to participate in referenda) and also in the 1990 Regulations (the right to join trade unions, associations and other organisations representing and protecting police officers’ interests, to participate in peaceful assemblies, make statements to the press, participate in radio or television programmes or publish works on politics, etc.) (see paragraphs 14 to 17 and 19 above).', '(iii) The Commission', '32. In its report the Commission, after examining the relevant domestic law as presented by the Government in the proceedings before it, observed that the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations had entered into force only in October 1994 and March 1995 respectively. The Commission, therefore, came to the conclusion that in the relevant period the impugned restriction had been based solely on Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution. Moreover, it considered that the notion of “political activities” was vague and sweeping and that the Government had not adduced any case-law interpreting this term. The constitutional restriction itself was not, therefore, precise enough to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct in the matter. The Commission concluded that, the requirement of foreseeability thus not having been met, the interference was not “prescribed by law”.', '33. In her submissions to the Court, the Commission’s Delegate explained that the various laws referred to by the Government in their memorial and, in particular, the 1990 Regulations, had been adopted prior to the impugned amendment to the Constitution. The only legal provisions which could be regarded as having further defined the constitutional restriction on political activities by police officers were to be found in the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations. Consequently, it was not until the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations came into force that the legal situation had met the requirement of foreseeability.', '(b) The Court’s assessment', '34. According to the Court’s well-established case-law, one of the requirements flowing from the expression “prescribed by law” is foreseeability. Thus, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49, and the Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 19, § 40). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cantoni v. France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1628, § 32). The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 24, § 48). Because of the general nature of constitutional provisions, the level of precision required of them may be lower than for other legislation.', '35. The Court notes the Government’s submission that Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution, which contains the generic term “political activities”, is subject to interpretation and is to be read in conjunction with complementary provisions contained in the various laws cited and the 1990 Regulations (see paragraphs 14 to 17, 19 and 31 above). As has been recalled many times in the Court’s case-law, it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see, for example, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35-36, § 25). In the absence of any domestic precedents to the opposite effect adduced by the applicant, the Court considers that the detailed provisions invoked by the Government cannot be held to be in contradiction with the general wording of the Constitution. Further, the adoption of the constitutional amendment in question did not result in the annulment of the 1990 Regulations, which were therefore in force when the impugned circular letters were issued. As a consequence, there appears to have existed at the relevant time a framework of provisions partly permitting – occasionally subject to authorisation – and partly restricting the participation of police officers in certain kinds of political activity.', '36. As to the wording of these provisions, it is inevitable, in the Court’s opinion, that conduct which may entail involvement in political activities cannot be defined with absolute precision. It seems, therefore, acceptable for the 1990 Regulations (see paragraph 19 above) – as for the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above) – to lay down the conditions for undertaking types of conduct and activities with potential political aspects, such as participation in peaceful assemblies, making statements to the press, participating in radio or television programmes, publications or joining trade unions, associations or other organisations representing and protecting police officers’ interests.', '37. The Court is satisfied that in the circumstances these provisions were clear enough to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct accordingly. Even accepting that it might not be possible on occasions for police officers to determine with certainty whether a given action would or would not –against the background of the 1990 Regulations – fall foul of Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution, it was nevertheless open to them to seek advice beforehand from their superior or clarification of the law by means of a court judgment.', '38. Having regard to these considerations, the Court finds that the interference was “prescribed by law” for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '2. Legitimate aim', '39. The Government submitted that the constitutional provision in question was aimed at depoliticising the police, and this during a period when Hungary was being transformed from a totalitarian regime to a pluralistic democracy. In view of the police’s past commitment to the ruling political party, the restriction served the purpose of protecting national security and public safety as well as preventing disorder.', '40. Neither the applicant nor the Commission expressed an opinion on this point.', '41. In the present case the obligation imposed on certain categories of public officials including police officers to refrain from political activities is intended to depoliticise the services concerned and thereby to contribute to the consolidation and maintenance of pluralistic democracy in the country. The Court notes that Hungary is not alone, in that a number of Contracting States restrict certain political activities on the part of their police. Police officers are invested with coercive powers to regulate the conduct of citizens, in some countries being authorised to carry arms in the discharge of their duties. Ultimately the police force is at the service of the State. Members of the public are therefore entitled to expect that in their dealings with the police they are confronted with politically neutral officers who are detached from the political fray, to paraphrase the language of the recent judgment in the case of Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, pp. 2376-77, § 53, which judgment concerned the compatibility with Article 10 of restrictions on the involvement of senior local government officers in certain types of political activity). In the Court’s view, the desire to ensure that the crucial role of the police in society is not compromised through the corrosion of the political neutrality of its officers is one that is compatible with democratic principles.', 'This objective takes on a special historical significance in Hungary because of that country’s experience of a totalitarian regime which relied to a great extent on its police’s direct commitment to the ruling party (see, mutatis mutandis, the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 25, § 51).', 'Accordingly, the Court concludes that the restriction in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10, namely the protection of national security and public safety and the prevention of disorder.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) General principles', '42. In its above-mentioned Vogt judgment (pp. 25-26, § 52) the Court summarised as follows the basic principles concerning Article 10 as laid down in its case-law:', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '43. In the same judgment the Court declared that “these principles apply also to civil servants. Although it is legitimate for a State to impose on civil servants, on account of their status, a duty of discretion, civil servants are individuals and, as such, qualify for the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. It therefore falls to the Court, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic State in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in Article 10 § 2. In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever civil servants’ right to freedom of expression is in issue the ‘duties and responsibilities’ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate” to the legitimate aim in question (p. 26, § 53). Such considerations apply equally to military personnel (see the previously cited Engel and Others judgment, pp. 23 and 41-42, §§ 54 and 100) and police officers (see paragraph 26 above).', '(b) Application of the above principles to the instant case', '44. The Government contended that for decades preceding Hungary’s return to democracy in 1989 to 1990, the police had been a self-avowed tool of the ruling party and had taken an active part in the implementation of the party policies. Career members of the police were expected to be politically committed to the ruling party. Given Hungary’s peaceful and gradual transformation towards pluralism without a general purge in the public administration, it was necessary to depoliticise, inter alia, the police and restrict the political activities of its members so that the public should no longer regard the police as a supporter of the totalitarian regime but rather as a guardian of democratic institutions.', '45. Neither the applicant nor the Commission expressed an opinion on this point.', '46. Bearing in mind the role of the police in society, the Court has recognised that it is a legitimate aim in any democratic society to have a politically neutral police force (see paragraph 41 above). In view of the particular history of some Contracting States, the national authorities of these States may, so as to ensure the consolidation and maintenance of democracy, consider it necessary to have constitutional safeguards to achieve this aim by restricting the freedom of police officers to engage in political activities and, in particular, political debate.', 'What remains to be determined is whether the particular restrictions imposed in the present case can be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”.', '47. The Court observes that between 1949 and 1989 Hungary was ruled by one political party. Membership of that party was, in many social spheres, expected as a manifestation of the individual’s commitment to the regime. This expectation was even more pronounced within the military and the police, where party membership on the part of the vast majority of serving staff guaranteed that the ruling party’s political will was directly implemented. This is precisely the vice that rules on the political neutrality of the police are designed to prevent. It was not until 1989 that Hungarian society succeeded in building up the institutions of a pluralistic democracy, leading to the first multi-party parliamentary elections in more than forty years being held in 1990. The impugned amendment to the Constitution was adopted some months prior to the second democratic parliamentary elections in 1994.', '48. Regard being had to the margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in this area, the Court finds that, especially against this historical background, the relevant measures taken in Hungary in order to protect the police force from the direct influence of party politics can be seen as answering a “pressing social need” in a democratic society.', '49. As to the extent of the restriction on the applicant’s freedom of expression, although the wording of Article 40/B § 4 might prima facie suggest that what is in issue is an absolute ban on political activities, an examination of the relevant laws shows that police officers have in fact remained entitled to undertake some activities enabling them to articulate their political opinions and preferences. Notably, whilst sometimes subject to restrictions imposed in the interest of the service, police officers have had the right to expound election programmes, promote and nominate candidates, organise election campaign meetings, vote in and stand for elections to Parliament, local authorities and the office of mayor, participate in referenda, join trade unions, associations and other organisations, participate in peaceful assemblies, make statements to the press, participate in radio or television programmes or publish works on politics (see paragraphs 14 to 20 above). In these circumstances the scope and the effect of the impugned restrictions on the applicant’s exercise of his freedom of expression do not appear excessive.', '50. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the means employed in order to achieve the legitimate aims pursued were not disproportionate. Accordingly, the impugned interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression is not in violation of Article 10.', 'ii. alleged violation of article 11 of the convention', '51. The applicant submitted that the prohibition on joining a party, prescribed by Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution, violated his right to freedom of association guaranteed under Article 11 of the Convention which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.', '2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.”', '52. Both the Commission and the Government accepted that the facts complained of by the applicant attracted the application of the safeguard set forth in Article 11 and that the prohibition interfered with the exercise of his right under that Article. They took the view, however, that the interference was justified under the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 11.', 'A. Submissions of those appearing before the Court as to whether the interference was justified', '1. The applicant', '53. The applicant argued that while Regulation 433 of the 1990 Regulations, which remained in force until March 1995, permitted police officers to be members of a party, Article 40/ B § 4 of the Constitution expressly prohibited this as from 1 January 1994. This situation, which lasted fifteen months, was contradictory and unconstitutional.', 'Moreover, the aims of the impugned prohibition were not indicated in Hungarian law. In fact, the prohibition could only be seen as serving political interests, and thus as not pursuing a “legitimate aim” for the purposes of Article 11 § 2.', '54. Furthermore, although the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 11 did not expressly refer to the requirement of “necessity”, the restriction in issue nevertheless had to be “necessary in a democratic society” in order to be justified under this paragraph, a condition not met in the present case. The fact that Hungary had recently become a pluralistic democracy and a member State of the Council of Europe should not give rise to any leniency when examining the criteria for justification of the interference. Neither could the interference be regarded as “proportionate” to the aims pursued, given that the restriction in fact amounted to a complete ban on police officers’ exercise of their right to freedom of association.', '2. The Government', '55. The Government expressed the view that, in any event, the last sentence of Article 11 § 2 provided sufficient justification for the impugned restriction on freedom of association, should it not be justified under the first sentence of that paragraph. In their opinion, the justification provided for in the last sentence was entirely independent of that in the first sentence; otherwise the provision would be superfluous.', '56. As to the requirement under the last sentence of Article 11 § 2 that a restriction be “lawful”, the Government first pointed out that what was in issue was a provision of the Hungarian Constitution. In reply to the applicant’s argument that between January 1994 and March 1995 Regulation 433 of the 1990 Regulations had been in contradiction with the contested constitutional provision, they explained that such ambiguities in the law were to be resolved by the Constitutional Court.', 'They submitted that the wish to depoliticise the police could not be regarded as “unlawful” in the sense of being arbitrary. In this respect they mainly reiterated their arguments concerning Article 10 (see paragraphs 39 and 44 above) and maintained in particular that the prohibition on party membership on the part of police officers had been intended to contribute to the elimination of any direct party political influence on the police by severing the institutional links which had previously existed between the armed forces and the police on the one hand and political circles on the other. Furthermore, the restriction in question could not be regarded as disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, since police officers’ right to freedom of association had been restricted exclusively in respect of political parties within the meaning of Law no. 33 of 1989 on political parties.', '3. The Commission', '57. The Commission was of the view that the prohibition in question fell to be examined under the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 11. To be “lawful” for the purposes of that sentence, a restriction must be in accordance with the national law and devoid of arbitrariness. Having been prescribed by the Constitution, the restriction was to be considered as being in accordance with the national law. As regards arbitrariness, the Commission recalled that States must be given a wide discretion when ensuring the protection of their national security (see the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59 in fine ). Against the background of Hungary’s recent history and the repercussions of a politically committed police force exploited for decades by a totalitarian regime, the Commission considered that the efforts to depoliticise the police could not be regarded as arbitrary. The prohibition was, therefore, also “lawful” within the wider meaning of that term in the second sentence of Article 11 § 2.', 'B. The Court’s assessment', '58. Notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 must in the present case also be considered in the light of Article 10. As the Court has explained in previous judgments, “the protection of personal opinions, secured by Article 10, is one of the objectives of the freedoms of assembly and association as enshrined in Article 11” (see the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 30, § 64).', '59. The last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 11 – which is undoubtedly applicable in the present case – entitles States to impose “lawful restrictions” on the exercise of the right to freedom of association by members of the police.', 'Like the Commission, the Court considers that the term “lawful” in this sentence alludes to the very same concept of lawfulness as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using the same or similar expressions, notably the expressions “in accordance with the law” and “prescribed by law” found in the second paragraph of Articles 9 to 11. As recalled above in relation to Article 10, the concept of lawfulness in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness (see paragraph 34 above).', '60. In so far as the applicant criticises the basis in domestic law of the impugned restriction (see paragraph 53 above), the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law, especially if there is a need to elucidate doubtful points (see the S.W. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-B, p. 42, § 36, and also the previously cited Chorherr and Cantoni judgments). In the present case, however, the prohibition on membership of a political party by police officers as contained in Article 40/ B § 4 of the Constitution is in fact unambiguous (see paragraph 13 above) and it would not appear to be arguable that subordinate legislation introduced some four years earlier (Regulation 433 of Decree no. 1/1990 of 10 January 1990 – see paragraph 19 above) was capable of affecting the scope of this prohibition. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the legal position was sufficiently clear to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct and that the requirement of foreseeability was accordingly satisfied. Further, the Court finds no ground for holding the restriction imposed on the applicant’s exercise of his freedom of association to be arbitrary. The contested restriction was consequently “lawful” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2.', '61. Finally, it is not necessary in the present case to settle the disputed issue of the extent to which the interference in question is, by virtue of the second sentence of Article 11 § 2, excluded from being subject to the conditions other than lawfulness enumerated in the first sentence of that paragraph. For the reasons previously given in relation to Article 10 (see paragraphs 41 and 46 to 48 above), the Court considers that, in any event, the interference with the applicant’s freedom of association satisfied those conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 31, § 68).', '62. In sum, the interference can be regarded as justified under paragraph 2 of Article 11. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 11 either.', 'iii. alleged violation of article 14 of the convention taken in conjunction with Articles 10 OR 11', '63. The applicant further alleged that the impugned prohibition on engaging in political activities and on joining a party was discriminatory. He relied on Article 14 of the Convention, which provides:', '“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”', '64. In his memorial, the applicant did not address the issue under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 10.', 'As to Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 11, he argued that there was no objective and reasonable justification for the prohibition on party membership, either in respect of police officers or other groups of public servants. The issue of party affiliation had in fact only very limited connection to the duties and responsibilities peculiar to members of the armed forces and the police. Any difference in treatment as to the possibility of joining a party should not be based on a prohibition of an unacceptably general character.', '65. The Government submitted that the restrictions in issue had been imposed not only on police officers but members of the armed forces, judges, Constitutional Court judges and public prosecutors as well. They maintained that any distinction between police officers and other groups of citizens as to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression – and, mutatis mutandis, freedom of association – could be justified on the ground of differences between the conditions of military and of civil life and, more specifically, by the duties and responsibilities peculiar to members of the armed forces and the police. They referred in this respect to the Engel and Others judgment (judgment cited above, p. 42, § 103).', '66. The Commission did not find it necessary to examine the applicant’s complaint under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 10.', 'As to Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 11, the Commission observed that the specific status of the applicant had already been taken into account when it had examined the justification for the prohibition in question under Article 11 § 2. The Commission found that those considerations were equally valid in the context of Article 14 and concluded that there was no appearance of any discrimination in breach of that Article taken in conjunction with Article 11.', '67. The Court’s conclusions that the contested restrictions do not amount to a violation of Articles 10 and 11 (see paragraphs 50 and 62 above) do not preclude the finding of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention. While it is true that the guarantee laid down in Article 14 has no independent existence in the sense that under the terms of that Article it relates solely to “rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention”, a measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe this Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature (see the case “relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” ( merits ), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-34, § 9).', '68. The considerations underlying the Court’s conclusions that the interferences with the applicant’s freedoms of expression and association were justified under Articles 10 § 2 and 11 § 2 have already taken into account the applicant’s special status as a police officer (see paragraphs 41, 46 to 49 and 61 above). These considerations are equally valid in the context of Article 14 and, even assuming that police officers can be taken to be in a comparable position to ordinary citizens, justify the difference of treatment complained of. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Articles 10 or 11.']",1,hu,001-58262,0

Background to the case', '6. The first applicant is a limited liability company, Bladet Tromsø A/S, which publishes the daily newspaper Bladet Tromsø in the town of Tromsø. The second applicant, Mr Pål Stensaas, was its editor. He was born in 1952 and lives at Nesbrua, near Oslo.', 'Tromsø is a regional capital of the northern part of Norway. It is the centre of the Norwegian seal hunting industry and has a university which includes an international polar research centre.', 'At the relevant time Bladet Tromsø had a circulation of about 9,000 copies. Like other local newspapers in Norway, it was used as a regular source by the Norwegian News Agency (“NTB”).', '7. Mr Odd F. Lindberg had been on board the seal hunting vessel M/S Harmoni (“the Harmoni ”) during the 1987 season as a freelance journalist, author and photographer. Several of his articles pertaining to that season had been published by Bladet Tromsø. These had not been hostile to seal hunting. On 3 March 1988 Mr Lindberg applied to the Ministry of Fisheries to be appointed seal hunting inspector for the 1988 season on board the Harmoni. Following his appointment on 9 March 1988 he served on board the Harmoni from 12 March to 11 April 1988, when the vessel returned to its port in Tromsø. Thereafter, and until 20 July 1988, Bladet Tromsø published twenty-six articles on Mr Lindberg’s inspection.', '8. On 12 April 1988 Bladet Tromsø printed an interview with Mr Lindberg in which he stated, inter alia, that certain seal hunters on the Harmoni had violated the 1972 Seal Hunting Regulations ( forskrifter for utøvelse av selfangst ) – as amended in 1980 – issued by the Ministry of Fisheries. The headline of the article read (all quotes below are translations from Norwegian):', '“Research reveals crude hunting methods in the West Ice', 'Deplorable violations of the regulations”', 'The introduction to the article quoted Mr Lindberg as follows (in bigger print):', '“ ‘If seal hunting is to be permitted to continue, certain sealers have to stop killing the seals in the way they do. During the last two winters, which I have spent in the Arctic Ocean, I have uncovered a great deal which is clearly inconsistent with acceptable seal hunting methods. However, I should like to emphasise: Only a few of the hunters are guilty of [such behaviour] and those few do the [seal hunting] industry a disservice and provide Greenpeace with good arguments. It is really regrettable and completely unnecessary!’ ”', 'The interview continued, inter alia, as follows:', '“ ‘If seal hunting is to be permitted to continue – and I am of the opinion that it should – there ought to be an inspector on every vessel. One that makes sure that the animals are killed in a proper manner and are not subjected to unnecessary suffering.', '... But let me emphasise: I am in favour of seal hunting, though it has to be carried out in an exemplary manner.’', '...', 'Mr Lindberg states that he has been threatened by hunters to remain silent about his observations and experiences during the seal hunting on the West Ice. He does not wish to go into details ...', '‘That will be covered in the report I am going to write ...’ ”', 'The article did not mention any seal hunter by name or provide any details of the allegedly illegal hunting methods.', '9. In order to defend themselves against the accusations contained in the above article of 12 April 1988 the skipper on the Harmoni and three of its crew members gave interviews which Bladet Tromsø published on 13 April. The introduction to the main interview stated (in bigger print), inter alia :', '“The crew on ... the Harmoni is really furious. The allegations made by ‘researcher’ Mr Lindberg regarding ... seal hunters’ beastly killing methods are too much to swallow. ‘Mr Lindberg is expressing a blatant lie. He pretends to be a researcher but has no clue of what he is talking about’, says Mr Kvernmo [crew member]. ”', 'A separate interview with Mr Kvernmo entitled “They feel themselves blackened” quoted him (in an introduction reproduced in bigger print) as follows:', '“ ‘I do not know what Mr Lindberg is trying to achieve with his accusations of bestial killing of seals. But we feel ourselves blackened and do not want to have this hanging over us.’ ”', 'Later in the interview Mr Kvernmo was quoted as saying:', '“ ‘... Mr Lindberg describes us as blood-thirsty murderers but we follow the rules and are humane ...’ ”', '10. Mr Lindberg’s official report on the hunting expedition was completed on 30 June 1988, two and a half months after the expedition. This was significantly later than the normal time allotted to the preparation of such reports and after the Ministry of Fisheries had enquired about it. The Ministry received it on 11 July 1988 and, because of the holiday period, did not review it immediately.', 'In his report, Mr Lindberg alleged a series of violations of the seal hunting regulations and made allegations against five named crew members. He stated, inter alia :', '“I have also noticed that [seals] which have been shot in such a manner that they appear to be dead have ‘awakened’ during the flaying ... I experienced several times that animals which were being flayed ‘alive’ showed signs that their brains’ electric activity had not been terminated.”', 'Mr Lindberg recommended that there should be a seal hunting inspector on every vessel and that compulsory training should be organised for all first-time hunters. Their knowledge of the regulations should also be tested. Finally, Mr Lindberg recommended an amendment to the regulations as regards the killing of mature seals in self-defence.', 'B. Order of non-disclosure of the report', '11. The Ministry of Fisheries decided temporarily (see paragraph 14 below) to exempt Mr Lindberg’s report from public disclosure relying on section 6, item 5, of a 1970 Act relating to Access of the Public to Documents in the Sphere of the Public Administration ( lov om offentlighet i forvaltningen, Law no. 69 of 19 June 1970). Under this provision, the Ministry was empowered to order that the report not be made accessible to the public, on the ground that it contained allegations of statutory offences.', 'An article published by Bladet Tromsø on 15 July 1988 contained the following observations on the Ministry’s decision:', '“ ‘The report is of such a nature that we have exempted it from public disclosure’, says [a counsellor in the Ministry]. ‘So far we have merely read through it. When we have had time to study it closely, it will be sent to the Fishing Inspectorate and to the Seal Hunting Council. But first we shall examine all the information provided by inspector Mr Lindberg, in particular as regards any incidents that might be relevant to the Penal Code. Everyone who is personally mentioned in the report will be given an opportunity to explain and defend himself.’ ”', 'C. The impugned articles published on 15 and 20 July 1988', '12. In the above-mentioned article of 15 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø, having received a copy of the report which Mr Lindberg had transmitted to the Ministry of Fisheries, reproduced some of his statements concerning the alleged breaches of the seal hunting regulations by members of crew of the Harmoni. The headlines on the front page read:', '“Shock report”', '“ ‘Seals skinned alive’ ”', 'The text on the front page stated:', '“Seal hunting inspector Mr Lindberg is criticising Norwegian seal hunters in a shock report on the last ... season. [He] refers to illegal methods of killing, drunken crew members and the illegal start of the hunt before the opening of the hunting season. Not least the report includes an account of his being beaten up by furious hunters, who also threatened to hit him on the head with a gaff [ hakapik ] if he did not keep quiet. ‘The report is of such a character that we have exempted it from public disclosure’, said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Fisheries.”', '13. On 19 and 20 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø published the entire report in two parts. The introduction to the first part stated:', '“... During the last days [Mr Lindberg’s report] has created considerable turbulence within the seal hunting [profession]. Most consider it a particularly severe attack on a profession which has already met with opposition, both nationally and internationally. In several responses to Bladet Tromsø it is clearly alleged that Mr Lindberg is an agent of Greenpeace.', 'Mr Lindberg has given us access to his notes from the [expedition]. The report has since been treated as confidential by the Ministry, given, inter alia, that various persons have been named and associated with breaches of the regulations. We have deleted the names ...', 'The report ... does not contain one-sided criticism ... Mr Lindberg also compliments a number of crew members ... [He] in addition writes that he is a sympathiser of seal hunting. But not with the manner in which it was conducted on the West Ice this year.”', 'The second part of Mr Lindberg’s report, which was published by Bladet Tromsø on 20 July 1988, contained the following statements ( while deleting with black ink the names of the crew members referred to in square brackets below):', '“At 11.45 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', '“At 14.40 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', '“At 15.00 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal.”', '“The same day [I] pointed out to the skipper that [a crew member] did not kill cubs in accordance with the regulations (i.e. he ... hit it with the spike [of the gaff] and then dragged the cub after him).”', '“At 15.00 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', '“At 19.00 [a crew member] killed a female [harp seal] which was protecting her pup.”', 'The hunting of harp seals had been legal in 1987.', 'D. Related publications by Bladet Tromsø during the period from 15 to 20 July 1988', '14. In a commentary of 15 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø stated:', '“Poor working conditions?', 'Are the authorities in proper control of seal hunting as conducted at present? Do the ... inspectors of the Ministry ... enjoy working conditions enabling them to deliver unbiased reports about seal hunting or do they become too dependent on having a good relationship with the seal hunters? In other words, are the sealing inspectors sufficiently independent in their supervision on board the sealing vessels?', 'These are questions which Bladet Tromsø has received from persons who know the industry well but, for various reasons, do not wish to come forward in public. The background to these questions is the report which Mr Lindberg has transmitted to his employer, the Ministry of Fisheries. Mr Lindberg was assigned as seal hunting inspector on board the Tromsø - registered vessel Harmoni ... during the 1988 season. The report is so critical that the Ministry has decided to keep it ‘confidential’ for the time being. ..., a counsellor in the Ministry ... admits that he has never before received a report from a seal hunting inspector which was ‘so unkind as this one’. ”', '15. On 18 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø published a further interview with crew member Mr Kvernmo, entitled “Severe criticism against the seal hunting inspector: The accusations are totally unfounded”. The caption under a photograph on the front page stated:', '“Sheer lies. ‘Judging from what has transpired in the media regarding [Mr Lindberg’s] report, I would characterise his statements as sheer lies’, says Mr Kvernmo. [He] ... demands that the report be handed over immediately [to the crew]. In this he is supported by two colleagues, Mr [S.] and Mr [M.] …”', 'The interview with Mr Kvernmo continued inside the newspaper and bore the headline “ ‘Mr Lindberg is lying’ ”.', 'The newspaper in addition published a letter on the same topic from Mr Kvernmo to the editor. According to Mr Kvernmo, Mr Lindberg’s presence on board the Harmoni in 1987 had not been appreciated. When he turned up at the departure of the 1988 expedition, this was after having made a number of unsuccessful requests to the shipowner and the crew. As a last resort, he had bluffed the Ministry into believing that he was to go with the Harmoni to the West Ice and that he could take on, on a voluntary basis, the task of inspector. Without further ado, the Ministry had appointed him inspector because he had offered to do the job free of charge. Consequently, the Ministry sent an inspector whose knowledge about seal hunting and hunting regulations was extremely weak and who was psychologically unsuited for the job. He had carried out his tasks in an utterly strange and poor manner.', '16. In an editorial, also published on 18 July 1988, the newspaper stated:', '“Some people are of the view that Norwegian seal hunting will again suffer from severe criticism from nature activists after the seal hunting inspector has revealed a number of objectionable circumstances in connection with an expedition. We believe this report will strengthen [Norway’s reputation] as a serious seal hunting nation, provided that the contents of the report are used in a constructive manner. In all professions there are certain persons who will abuse the confidence which society has placed in them and who will operate on the edge of the law. The fisheries authorities must react strongly against all abuse. The authorities now have a unique opportunity to clarify the purpose of Norwegian seal hunting and how it should be conducted in an internationally acceptable manner.', '...', 'What is revealed by the fresh report ... has to be perceived as a single, regrettable episode warranting ... a closer scrutiny of the manner in which Norwegian seal hunting should be carried out in the years to come ...”', '17. On 19 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø published an article entitled:', '“The Sailors’ Federation is furious and brands the seal report as:', '‘A work commissioned by Greenpeace!’ ”', 'Two representatives of the Norwegian Sailors’ Federation were quoted, inter alia, as follows:', '“ ‘We know our seal hunters and also have a certain knowledge of ... inspector Mr Lindberg. In the light of this we dare to say: We do not believe a word of what is stated in [his] report! Nor do we doubt for a second that [he] was placed on board the Harmoni by Greenpeace. We will therefore demand that the Ministry provide all the information surrounding [his] appointment ...', '... We are also greatly surprised that the writer of Bladet Tromsø ’s editorial [of 18 July 1988] really dares to take a stand in this matter without having any better knowledge of seal hunting. We consider that frightening ...’ ”', '18. On the same date Bladet Tromsø published an interview with Mr Lindberg, in which he stressed that his report had included positive statements concerning ten crew members, whom he named.', '19. In an interview published by Bladet Tromsø on 20 July 1988 a representative of Greenpeace denied that it had been involved in any way in producing Mr Lindberg’s report.', 'E. Other related publications, contemporaneous with or post-dating the impugned publications', '1. Press release issued by the Ministry of Fisheries', '20. In a press release dated 20 July 1988, the Ministry of Fisheries stated that because of its peculiar contents and form, the Lindberg report had been exempted from public disclosure until further notice. According to veterinary expertise, it was practically impossible to flay a seal alive, whilst it was usual that reflex movements in the animal’s muscles occur during slaughter. As regards the appointment of Mr Lindberg as an inspector, the Ministry stated that he had referred in his application to the fact that he had attended the seal hunt in 1987 in order to study all aspects of the hunt and to carry out research for the University of Oslo. He intended to attend also the 1988 season. The purpose of his research was to write a book on seal hunting and to carry out scientific work. In addition he had indicated that, since at all events he was to go with the Harmoni during the 1988 season, he was prepared to carry out the inspection without remuneration. The Ministry had had several telephone conversations with Mr Lindberg, during which he said that he had studied biology and was affiliated to several scientific associations, particularly in the area of polar research. In view of the fact that Mr Lindberg was willing to do the job free of charge and, especially, his research background, the Ministry decided to appoint him. While seeking to attend the hunting expedition, he had offered his services to the Institute of Biology at the University of Oslo. As a result, during the expedition, he had collected for the University certain parts of seal bodies. Later investigations had revealed that the inspector had no formal higher education and no competence as a researcher, nor any experience with the killing of animals. His strong reactions and comments on the killing of the animals were characterised by the fact that he did not have the required background for being an inspector. His report could not be regarded as a serious and adequate inspection report.', '2. Publications by Bladet Tromsø', '21. On 21 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø published an article entitled “The Ministry of Fisheries rejects Mr Lindberg’s report”, which quoted a senior official of the Ministry as having said:', '“ ‘[Mr Lindberg’s] report cannot be regarded as a serious ... inspection report; it is characterised by the fact that he lacks the professional background which an inspector should have …’ ”', '22. Another article published by Bladet Tromsø on the same day quoted Mr Kvernmo as follows:', '“ ‘We are genuinely pleased that Mr Lindberg’s allegations that we violated legal laws and regulations during this year’s seal hunting ... have been rejected by the Ministry ... We would never accept allegations that we were, among other things, flaying seals alive ...’ ”', '23. A further article published by Bladet Tromsø on 23 July 1988 bore the following headline:', '“The seal hunters are being bullied – The Sailors’ Federation wants to involve the police: ‘Have the whole seal matter investigated’ ”', 'On the same day Bladet Tromsø published a further interview with a senior official of the Ministry of Fisheries, quoting the latter as having stated:', '“ ‘In my view the media have now harassed the seal hunting profession enough. Imagine if you, working in the media, were to be harassed in the same manner. I can tell you that there are now seal hunters who cannot sleep and who are receiving telephone calls day and night.’', 'Yesterday [the official] seemed more or less overcome, not least after [the newspaper] Aftenposten had published photographs taken by Mr Lindberg during this year’s seal hunting showing how seals are being killed with a gaff. [The official] had no compliment to spare for Bladet Tromsø either: ‘You were the ones who started this craziness!’... ”', '24. In a further article published by Bladet Tromsø on 25 July 1988 two former seal hunting inspectors were quoted as follows:', '“ ‘We cannot claim that Mr Lindberg has not witnessed and experienced what he describes in his report ... But he has drawn completely wrong conclusions. Norwegian [seal hunters in the Arctic Ocean] are diligent and responsible and have much higher morals than regular Norwegian hunters when it comes to killing animals ...’ ”', '3. Other media coverage', '25. On 15 July 1988 the Norwegian News Agency issued a news bulletin reiterating some of the information provided by Bladet Tromsø on the same date as to Mr Lindberg’s allegations (see paragraph 12 above). It stated that the Ministry of Fisheries was of the view that violations of the seal hunting regulations might have occurred. This bulletin was dispatched to its approximately 150 subscribers and various newspapers published articles which were based on it.', '26. In a bulletin of 18 July 1988 the Norwegian News Agency – using Bladet Tromsø as its source – affirmed, firstly, that the crew had demanded that the report immediately be made accessible to the public (“ straks … offentliggjort ”) and, secondly, that the Association of Fishing Vessel Companies had also called for the report to be made public. The Government submitted that the first statement had been based on Bladet Tromsø ’s article of 18 July 1988 (see paragraph 15 above), misrepresenting, however, the fact that the crew had only requested that the report be handed over to it. In another news bulletin of the same date, the Agency reported the Ministry as having stated that veterinary experts would consider the controversial Lindberg report; that the Ministry would issue further information on the outcome and possibly also on the circumstances of his recruitment as inspector but would not comment any further until it had collected more information. It further stated that, on that date, both the Association of Fishing Vessel Companies and the crew had requested that the report be made accessible to the public. Bladet Tromsø received the bulletin on the same day.', 'According to a news bulletin of 19 July 1988, the Ministry of Fisheries had stated that, when appointing him inspector, it had relied on information supplied by Mr Lindberg himself to the effect that he was carrying out research projects. The Agency understood the Ministry to mean that his research and links to the University of Oslo were thought to be far more extensive than they had been in reality.', 'In a further news bulletin issued later on the same day, the Agency stated that Mr Lindberg had refused to meet with officials of the Ministry to discuss his report.', 'On 19 July 1988 the newspaper Adresseavisen, referring to the news bulletins issued by the Norwegian News Agency, stated that the seal hunters had requested that Mr Lindberg’s report be made public.', '27. Mr Lindberg’s report continued to receive a wide coverage in other media as well. On 29 July and 3 August 1988 extensive excerpts from the report were published in Fiskaren, a bi-weekly for fishermen. One of the articles published on 29 July 1988 bore the following headline:', '“Mr Lindberg in the report on seal hunting:', '‘It happens that animals are being flayed while their eyes are rolling and they are yelping’ ”', 'The introduction to the article read as follows:', '“ ‘During the last part of the hunting period the animals, once shot, are rarely examined so as to verify that the shots have been lethal ... The animals are thereafter lifted on board, often alive. Animals are therefore often flayed while ... their eyes are rolling and they are yelping.’', 'These are some of the occurrences which Mr Lindberg claims to have observed while acting as a seal hunting inspector on board the Harmoni ... Such ... statements have made the Ministry ... and professionals consider that Mr Lindberg’s report is ‘not serious’ and wish not to make it accessible to the public.', 'In [his] report Mr Lindberg makes very strong accusations against named hunters. In the excerpts published by Fiskaren we have consistently deleted all names.”', '28. The excerpt published by Fiskaren on 3 August 1988 included the observations which Mr Lindberg had made in the report as reproduced by Bladet Tromsø on 20 July 1988.', '29. Over the following months the debate about Mr Lindberg’s report died out until 9 February 1989, when he gave a press conference in Oslo. A film entitled “Seal Mourning” (containing footage shot by Mr Lindberg from the Harmoni ) showed certain breaches of the seal hunting regulations. Clips from the film were broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation later the same day and the entire film was broadcast by a Swedish television channel on 11 February 1989. During the next days scenes from the film were broadcast by up to twenty broadcasting companies worldwide, including CNN and the British Broadcasting Corporation.', 'F. The Commission of Inquiry report', '30. In view of the various reactions to the film, both within Norway and internationally, the Minister of Fisheries was recalled while on an official journey abroad. Seal hunting was debated in Parliament on 14 February 1989 and, on 24 February 1989, the government announced that it would set up a Commission of Inquiry. The government also banned with immediate effect the killing of baby seals or pups.', '31. On 5 September 1990 the Commission of Inquiry submitted an extensive report based on various evidence, including, inter alia, Mr Lindberg’s inspection report, his footage as well as a book written by him. For the purposes of the inquiry Mr Lindberg had been examined as a witness by the Sarpsborg City Court ( byrett ). The Commission had also heard several of the crew members of the Harmoni as well as other seal hunting inspectors.', 'In its report the Commission of Inquiry found that the truth of most of Mr Lindberg’s allegations relating to specifically named individuals had not been proved. It found no basis for the allegation that seals had been skinned alive or that pups had been kicked or flayed alive (p. 8).', 'On the other hand, the Commission identified several breaches of the hunting regulations (p. 69), which it deemed had been established by the footage presented by Mr Lindberg. For instance, one seal had been killed with the sharp end of a gaff without previously having been hit with its dull end. Another seal had been killed with an axe, whereas a third seal had been lifted on board the Harmoni whilst still alive. The Commission published those parts of Mr Lindberg’s report which pertained to the Harmoni ’s hunting expedition, after deleting the crew members’ names. The Commission further recommended various amendments to the hunting regulations, to their implementation and to the training of hunters. These recommendations were in line with some of the suggestions Mr Lindberg made in his report, notably as to the training of hunters on killing methods, the dissemination to hunters of information on the applicable rules and obligatory presence of an inspector on board every hunting vessel.', 'G. Defamation proceedings against Mr Lindberg', '32. In March 1989 the crew of the Harmoni had instituted defamation proceedings against Mr Lindberg before the Sarpsborg City Court, referring to statements which he had made about them in respect of the 1987 and 1988 hunting seasons. By judgment of 25 August 1990 the City Court declared five statements in his inspection report null and void under Article 253 § 1 of the Penal Code. Two other statements made by Mr Lindberg in another context were also declared null and void.', 'Moreover, the City Court prohibited Mr Lindberg from showing in public any of the footage pertaining to the Harmoni and ordered him to pay to the crew compensation (10,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK)) under the Damage Compensation Act 1969 and costs. His request for leave to appeal against the judgment was rejected by the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court ( Høyesteretts Kjæremålsutvalg ) on 16 May 1991.', '33. Being resident in Sweden, Mr Lindberg opposed the execution in Sweden of the Sarpsborg City Court’s judgment of 25 August 1990, on the ground that it violated his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.', 'In a decision of 16 December 1998, the Swedish Supreme Court ( Högsta Domstolen ) upheld a decision by the Court of Appeal ( Hovrätten ) of Western Sweden of 25 April 1997, rejecting Mr Lindberg’s claim. While noting that it was not its role to carry out a full review of the Norwegian judgment, the Swedish Supreme Court found that the latter did not entail any breach of Mr Lindberg’s rights under Article 10. This provision did not, therefore, constitute an obstacle to execution. Nor did the fact that the film in question had been shown in Sweden mean that it would run counter to Swedish public-order interests to execute the Norwegian judgment.', 'H. Defamation proceedings giving rise to the applicants’ complaint under the Convention', '34. On 15 May 1991 the crew members of the Harmoni also instituted defamation proceedings against the applicants, seeking compensation and requesting that certain statements appearing in Mr Lindberg’s report and reproduced by Bladet Tromsø on 15 and 20 July 1988 be declared null and void.', '35. On 4 March 1992, after having heard the parties to the case and witnesses over a period of three days, the Nord-Troms District Court ( herredsrett ) gave its judgment in which it unanimously found the following statements defamatory under Article 247 of the Penal Code and declared them null and void ( død og maktesløs; mortifisert ) under Article 253 § 1 (the numbering in square brackets below follows that appearing in the Court’s reasoning):', '(Statements appearing in the part of the Lindberg report published by Bladet Tromsø on 20 July 1988)', '[1.1] “At 11.45 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', '[1.2] “At 14.40 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', '[1.3] “At 15.00 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal.”', '[1.6] “At 19.00 [a crew member] killed a female which was protecting her pup.”', '(Statements appearing in one of the articles published by Bladet Tromsø on 15 July 1988)', '[2.1] “Seals skinned alive”', '[2.2] “Not least the report includes an account of his (Mr Lindberg) being beaten up by furious hunters, who also threatened to hit him on the head with a gaff if he did not keep quiet.”', 'On the other hand, the District Court rejected the seal hunters’ claim with respect to the following statements published on 20 July 1988:', '[1.4] “The same day [I] pointed out to the skipper that [a crew member] did not kill cubs in accordance with the regulations (i.e. he ... hit it with the spike [of the gaff] and then dragged the cub after him).”', '[1.5] “At 15.00 [a crew member] beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup.”', 'The District Court provided the following reasons:', '“As regards the statements concerned, it is a basic condition for declaring these null and void that they be defamatory. This question must be considered in the light of how the statements were perceived by the ordinary newspaper reader. Moreover, the statements must not be interpreted separately. The decisive factor must be how they were understood when the articles were read as a whole. The position is somewhat different, however, as far as justification is concerned. The Court will revert to this matter below. Even though the statements are to be considered on the basis of an overall assessment, it would nevertheless be correct to accord weight to the fact that the matter was splashed across the front page in bold type. The first impression given was thus that something serious had occurred. This impression was not appreciably lessened or altered by the more detailed article inside the newspaper. This factor must be deemed particularly significant.', 'The Court finds it clear that both statements in question of 15 July 1988 are defamatory. One of them read: ‛Seals skinned alive’ (‘ sel levende flådd ’). This assertion must be understood to mean that the seal hunters committed acts of cruelty to the animals. It goes without saying that skinning an animal alive causes severe pain to it. When read as a whole, the statement must be understood to apply not only to one seal, but to several. It gives the impression that the seal hunters not infrequently skinned seals while they were still alive.', 'The other statement reads: ‘Not least the report includes an account of his being beaten up by furious hunters, who also threatened to hit him on the head with a gaff if he did not keep quiet’. This statement must imply that the seal hunters had assaulted Mr Lindberg, which, objectively speaking, amounts to a criminal act, cf. Article 228 of the Penal Code. The threat to hit him on the head with their gaffs if he did not keep quiet comes within the objective description of the offence set out in Article 227 of the Penal Code. The allegation must therefore be understood to mean that the seal hunters had committed two offences. Such a statement must clearly be considered defamatory.', 'As regards the statements concerning female harp seals, it is not disputed that such seal hunting was not permitted in 1988. Reference is made to items 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6 of the allegations ...', 'Item 1.4 also concerns a violation of the seal hunting regulations. In this regard, reference is made to Article 8 b of the regulations, according to which the seal shall first be struck with the blunt end of the gaff and then with the spike. The reason for this is that the animals are to be knocked unconscious before they are killed with the spike. The statement must imply that the blows with the blunt end had been omitted.', 'A breach of the regulations constitutes a criminal offence. It is regarded as a misdemeanour and may be punished by a fine. Generally speaking, an allegation of such a violation must also be considered to be defamatory ...', 'In the Court’s view, the statements relating to the killing of female harp seals must be regarded as defamatory.', 'Hunting for this species of seal was not permitted at all in 1988. The statements do not differ from allegations of illegal hunting in general and imply that the crew behaved in a morally reprehensible manner. The Court will deal below with the question as to whether the statements can be regarded as substantiated and thus lawful.', 'The Court is, however, in doubt as regards the statement quoted in item 1.4. It is not alleged that the seal pups were made to suffer, but simply that the killing methods used were not in accordance with the regulations. Given that it is not alleged that the seal pups were made to suffer, the statement can hardly be interpreted as implying strong moral condemnation of the seal hunter. ... The decisive question is whether the killing is carried out in a responsible manner. The statement cannot be understood to mean that it was not. At any rate, given the fact that it was not suggested that the pups had been made to suffer, the matter must be regarded as trivial. The court has, with some doubt, reached the conclusion that the statement cannot be considered defamatory.', 'Accordingly, with the exception of item 1.4, the statements must fall within two of the situations described in Article 247 of the Penal Code, i.e. ‘to harm another person’s good name or reputation’, and ‘to expose him to ... loss of the confidence necessary for his position or business’. There can be no doubt that the statements were capable of having such effects. In this regard, the defendants have pointed out that considerable sympathy was shown to the crew during the ensuing public debate. The legal requirement is, however, that the statements were ‘capable’ of doing harm. The ensuing debate revealed that opinions about the hunting process differed.', 'There has been considerable opposition to seal hunting for a number of years, particularly at the international level. Although many people in Norway, especially in northern Norway, were opposed to Mr Lindberg, this did not automatically mean that there was a corresponding support for the seal hunters. The latter received media coverage because of their hunting methods, for which they are being remembered. Apart from this, the crew members were not much involved in the debate about other aspects of seal hunting, in particular, the ecological aspect of the debate was especially heated during the so-called seal invasions at the end of the 1980s.', 'It is undisputed that the group of persons to whom the statements apply is not so wide as to leave unaffected the individuals concerned. The defendants have thus not argued that deletion [of names] ensured sufficient anonymity. Even though the names of individual seal hunters had been deleted, it was clear that the Harmoni was the vessel at issue. Therefore, everyone who was on board must be seen as having been aggrieved by the statements ... In fact the deletion had an effect which was contrary to its purpose. In the report only four of the crew are named as having committed offences. If the newspaper had not deleted the names, the group of persons targeted would have been reduced correspondingly ...', 'Although the statements objectively fall within the scope of Article 247 of the Penal Code, it is also a requirement that they be ‘unlawful’ [ rettsstridig ]. In this regard the defendants have submitted several arguments. Firstly, it is argued that the seal hunting matter in Norway was probably the biggest news story in 1988. It is argued that in such a situation the press must enjoy a great deal of latitude in order to enable it to highlight all aspects of the matter (the ‘public interest’ point of view) ...', 'The Court accepts that an extensive freedom of expression must apply to discussion on matters of general public interest. This consideration is precisely the linchpin of Article 100 of the Norwegian Constitution and it is essential in a democratic society ... In spite of this, however, there are some limitations. Firstly, the Court has in mind that certain requirements relating to privacy and truth must be taken into account. ... All the statements complained of must be understood to mean that the crew of the Harmoni committed unlawful acts. This is the main theme of the newspaper articles of 15 and 20 July 1988.', 'It hardly appears to the Court that the newspaper’s presentation of the matter, particularly on 15 July, was primarily intended to promote a serious debate on matters of public interest. It focused on the criminal aspects. The public debate for and against seal hunting definitely remained in the background. The form in which the material was presented must also be taken into consideration. The affair was splashed across the front page in bold type. Words such as ‘lie’ are used in one of the headings of the articles that follow. The Court is definitely of the impression that the primary motive of the newspaper was to be the first to print the story. In particular the front-page article is of a sensational nature. Sufficient attention was not paid to the protection of other persons in this disclosure. The newspaper was also aware that the material was sensitive and had thus particular reason to proceed with caution. The journalist, Mr Raste, had been told, presumably on 13 July, during a telephone conversation with the Ministry of Fisheries, that the report was exempt from public disclosure. In the light of this, the Court cannot see that the newsworthiness of the matter could justify the manner in which it was presented.', 'Secondly, it has been argued that the publication concerns an official document. According to the newspaper, such documents are reliable sources which one should be able to trust. In this regard, reference is being made to Article 253 § 3 of the Penal Code. Generally speaking, the Court agrees that official documents must normally be considered as good journalistic sources. How good they are, however, depends on the circumstances. In the present case, the newspaper was aware that the report had been exempt from public disclosure and the reasons therefor. The Ministry wished to investigate the matter more closely before deciding whether to make the report public. Mr Raste was also aware that the allegation that seals had been skinned alive would sound like a tall story. Mr Raste himself kept sheep and had some insight into the killing of animals. In spite of this, the matter was given wide coverage. In the circumstances, the newspaper clearly should have investigated the matter more closely before printing the material. On the evidence adduced, the Court finds that no investigation had been made. In his testimony, Mr Gunnar Gran, Secretary General of the Norwegian Press Association, stated that, as a matter of press ethics, it was objectionable to print the allegation that seals had been skinned alive if Mr Raste was aware that it was untrue.', 'Statements based on an inspection report clearly fall outside the ambit of Article 253 § 3. This provision is exhaustive ...', '... The defendants have invoked Article 10 of the Convention. In this connection what is called the ‘public interest’ point of view has been stressed. This may be described as the doctrine of unrestricted freedom of expression with regard to matters of public interest. Although the Court has in fact already dealt with this point, it sees reason to comment that the present case differs from the Sunday Times case and the Lingens v. Austria case.', 'The latter case concerned in particular the expression of political opinions. Mr Lingens, the editor, had used such expressions as ‘the basest opportunism’, ‘immoral’ and ‘undignified’ to describe certain aspects of Chancellor Bruno Kreisky’s character. These are value judgments and are not, like the statements in the present case, linked to facts ...', 'A defamatory statement which is true is not unlawful, cf. Article 253 § 1 and Article 249 § 1 of the Penal Code. In the present case, the defendants have admitted that, except in the case of one female harp seal, no proof has been adduced. However, it has been argued that Mr Lindberg produced photos showing that several female harp seals had been killed. Notwithstanding the said admission by the defence, the Court will assess the matter for itself. As regards item 2.1 of the allegations, it has clearly not been proved that the statement was true or probably true. On the contrary, Mr Raste was of the opinion that the statement had to be inaccurate. Mr Lindberg and Mr K. have submitted two different versions. As to item 2.2 there is no reason for the Court to give greater credence to Mr Lindberg than to Mr K. The Court cannot see that there are other circumstances that would support this statement. Thus there is no evidence to substantiate the statement.', 'As regards the killing of female harp seals the Commission of Inquiry states at p. 84 of its report: ‘Our conclusion is that we must regard the allegations about the killing of five female harp seals as highly improbable.’ It is, however, a fact that the Harmoni was carrying the skin of a female harp seal when it returned from the West Ice. [Crew member S.’s] explanation was that [crew member H.] had killed a harp seal pup. Its mother had been nowhere in sight. She had turned up afterwards and had attacked [H.]. He had become frightened and had tried to hit her on the nose with his gaff. He had, however, hit her too hard, so that she had started bleeding. The mother had been killed because of the blood. This is the matter referred to in item 1.5. The Court cannot see that the statement gives an objectively incorrect impression of what occurred. This does not imply that the Court finds that [H.] acted unlawfully. If he acted in self-defence, his action was not unjustified. This question the Court does not need to determine. Against this background the expression will not be declared null and void.', 'The other statements concerning female harp seals have not ... been substantiated by documentary evidence. The seal hunters deny that more than one female harp seal had been killed. In his testimony Mr Lindberg referred to photos which, in his view, substantiated the statements. He refused to produce the photos so that they could be assessed by experts. The day after [his] testimony ... an article appeared in ... Bladet Tromsø, accompanied by a photo of female harp seals. According to the seal hunters, the photo dated back to 1987, when such seal hunting had been permitted. The Court cannot base its decision on newspaper articles but only on what has taken place during the main hearing. Therefore it must be obvious that the other statements cannot be regarded as having been proved. Moreover, the Court is somewhat surprised by Mr Lindberg’s refusal to produce the photos in court.', 'To sum up, the Court observes that the conditions have been fulfilled for declaring null and void the statements cited in items 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2 of the allegations. The expression cited in item 1.4 is not deemed to be defamatory, whereas that cited in item 1.5 is deemed to have been proved true.', 'It is not a requirement for declaring the statements null and void that the conditions for imposing a penalty have been fulfilled ... The Court will consider the question of liability when discussing the claim for damages.', 'The conditions for awarding damages are set out in sections 3-6, subsection one, of the Damages Compensation Act 1969 ( Skadeerstatningsloven, 13 June 1969, no. 26) … Only [compensation for non-pecuniary damage] has been claimed. It is being specifically argued that the newspaper must be deemed to have acted negligently and that it would be reasonable if the Court were to make an award for non-pecuniary damage. In its assessment, the Court will attach weight to the existence of negligence as well as other circumstances. Thus, a number of factors are relevant to its determination of the compensation issue. In the Court’s view, the newspaper has behaved negligently. It had made no further investigation prior to the publication of the material in question, despite this having been called for in the circumstances. The Court has expressed its views on this point above. As regards the compensation claim, it must nevertheless consider the significance of the measures taken to preserve anonymity. The deletion of names did not mean that the crew members could not be identified. As the name of the vessel, Harmoni, was clearly stated, it was easy to find out the identity of the crew. The individual seal hunters were known to their neighbours, acquaintances, families, etc. The newspaper must have been aware of this. In any event, it ought to have known that there was a real risk that the persons in question would be identified.', 'The Court finds it reasonable that the plaintiffs be awarded compensation. The newspaper coverage caused such inconvenience to the crew members and damage to their reputation as to justify upholding their claim. A total of 2,999 seals were caught during the expedition to the West Ice. Even though it is probable that some violations of the seal hunting regulations occurred, the rendering of Mr Lindberg’s report gave a grossly distorted picture. The main impression is that the regulations were essentially complied with.', 'As far as [the second applicant] is concerned, sections 3-6 must be read in conjunction with Article 431 of the Penal Code. The editor was at his cottage at the time and was not fully aware of the contents of the matters printed. Nonetheless, he did consent to the material being printed. Mr Stensaas has not invoked the exception clause on freedom from liability. Accordingly, [he] must also be considered liable for the newspaper articles. This in turn will have a bearing on the compensation issue.', '...', 'There are factors militating in favour of awarding a substantial amount in compensation: in the first place, certain statements in the preparatory work and, secondly, the degree of abusiveness of the material and the extent to which it was disseminated. In this connection it should be noted that Mr Lindberg has been ordered to pay each of the plaintiffs NOK 10,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage [see paragraph 32 above]. … In determining the amount, importance has been attached to the fact that the statements were widely disseminated. Given that this factor has already been taken into account, it must carry a little lesser weight in the case against the newspaper. Otherwise the crew would to some extent receive double compensation.', 'Moreover, the newspaper was aware that the material was sensitive and that one of the allegations was false. A further factor is the form in which the material was presented, as is the fact that no investigations had been made. In addition, the newspaper did not apologise for having printed the material.', 'A factor pointing in the opposite direction is, in particular, the fact that the crew members were permitted to express their views. Generally speaking, the seal hunting matter was one of the biggest news stories in 1988. This fact must be accorded some weight, although it does not free the newspaper from liability. In the light of the circumstances, the Court cannot see that importance should be attached to the fact that inspector reports are normally public documents. Mr Lindberg’s report had been exempt from public disclosure. Nor is it significant that the report was eventually also published by Fiskaren. This fact was only mentioned but was not elaborated upon during the main hearing. The Court has no knowledge of the context, circumstances, etc. The financial standing of [the first applicant] is of significance. The Court finds that the newspaper has been in somewhat strained circumstances for several years. Still its gross annual turnover is said to be approximately NOK 30 million.', 'Accordingly, each of the plaintiffs is to be paid NOK 11,000 in compensation, of which NOK 10,000 are to be paid by the newspaper, and NOK 1,000 by the editor. The newspaper is also jointly and severally liable with the editor for the amount he has to pay.”', '36. On 18 March 1992 the applicants sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ( Høyesterett ), alleging that the District Court had made an error of law. On 18 July 1992, the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court decided not to allow the appeal, finding it obvious that the appeal would not succeed.', 'I. Defamation proceedings against other media companies', '37. The crew of the Harmoni also brought defamation proceedings against other media companies, including the newspaper Aftenposten, its editor and journalist, in respect of an article published on 22 July 1988 on the seal hunting issue. The action did not relate to an article of 16 July 1988 in which Aftenposten reproduced Mr Lindberg’s statements, published by Bladet Tromsø, to the effect that seals had been flayed alive.', 'In a judgment of 1 February 1993 the Oslo City Court dismissed the action. The City Court found that, although the impugned article had contained several allegations that seal hunting regulations had been violated, the manner of journalistic reporting at issue could not be considered “unlawful” (“ rettsstridig ”).', 'The City Court stated, inter alia :', '“ Bladet Tromsø received the report from Mr Lindberg in July and published a major article on 15 July 1988, in which it was claimed that seals had been ‘skinned alive’. The article aroused great media interest. The Norwegian Telegram Agency ... issued bulletins on the seal hunting affair on 15, 18, 20 and 21 July. Aftenposten also followed up the affair, but most of its coverage was based on [those] bulletins. Aftenposten ’s first article, published on 16 July, stated in an introductory paragraph: ‘Strong criticism of seal hunters’. In an evening issue on the same date it was stated: ‘Seal hunters must explain’. In the morning issue on 18 July the seal hunters had their say at p. 4, under the heading: ‘Seal hunters: never flayed seals alive’. Mr Kvernmo had stated to the newspaper that ‘we are shocked about Mr Lindberg’s allegations that we have skinned seals alive. ... He is of the view that Mr Lindberg has misunderstood the situation during the seal hunt and deplores that the crew has been blamed in his report to the Ministry of Fisheries.’ Furthermore, it is stated that ‘the allegation is so grotesque and removed from reality that a number of seal hunters have reacted very strongly against these. ‘Flaying seals alive has never occurred during the sixty seal hunt seasons in which I have participated’, says arctic shipowner, Mr Jacobsen. … On 19 July Aftenposten published an interview with seal inspector, Mr Nilssen, under the headline ‘Disagreement on killing methods applied to seal’. On 21 July it published an article entitled: ‘Seal hunting report without substantiated allegations’ …', 'To sum up, the Court considers the seal hunting case, as it stood on the evening of 21 July as follows:', 'Mr Lindberg’s report had aroused a great deal of interest. Its contents had been disputed by the seal hunters, a shipowner and the Ministry of Fisheries. All the different points of view had been reported in Aftenposten. Despite the refutations of the report made by the seal hunters and the Ministry of Fisheries, its contents had not been effectively and objectively refuted …', 'Aftenposten ’s report on 22 July amounted to a continuation of the seal hunting debate which had already started. Attacks had been made against the report and these Mr Lindberg wished to counter, through the newspaper article – together with photographs. The debate was going on and it was only natural that Aftenposten allowed Mr Lindberg to present his version of the matter … The Court considers that Aftenposten ’s article enabled the discussion to progress.', 'Aftenposten ’s presentation is an objective, balanced account in defence of Mr Lindberg’s report. The article presents the evidence put forward by Mr Lindberg in support of the accuracy of the report and is an important element in the current seal hunting debate. Aftenposten focuses on the lawfulness of the existing seal hunting methods and has no intention of exposing the seal hunters to public contempt by means of malicious coverage ... The coverage clearly cannot be compared to the article printed in ... Bladet Tromsø on 15 July. The Court would also point out that Aftenposten fairly consistently refers to Mr Lindberg as its source. Although the heading, when seen together with the photos, suggests that there have been violations of the regulations and cruelty to animals, these violations are not particularly highlighted. The newspaper focuses on the seal hunting case. It should also be noted that on the following day the sealers were given an opportunity, in a conspicuous place, to refute the inspector’s report. This indicates that there was an ongoing debate on a matter of public interest in which the parties involved were, in a proper manner, given an opportunity to express their views. Aftenposten ’s coverage of the seal hunting case is characterised precisely by reciprocity: Aftenposten maintained that, from a journalistic point of view, the coverage of 22 July was exemplary. The Court agrees with the newspaper’s view, particularly as regards the situation that obtained prior to the article published on 22 July.', 'The Court does not see any reason to examine whether Aftenposten has adduced proof. The Commission of Inquiry report … concludes that the regulations have clearly been breached. At p. 101, the Commission states:', '‘We cannot avoid mentioning that during the period under consideration the implementation of the hunting regulations has been characterised by several defects which on the whole are not insignificant.’', 'The ensuing circumstances thus demonstrate that Aftenposten to a large degree could substantiate the allegations that the rules had been breached. Mr Lindberg’s report was not a serious work and suffered from a number of shortcomings, but parts of it proved later to be accurate.', 'Accordingly, the Court concludes that Aftenposten ’s coverage was not unwarranted. It does not contain any unlawful defamatory statements ...”', 'The crew members’ appeal to the Supreme Court was not allowed. Their claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage was further rejected by the Eidsivating High Court ( lagmannsrett ) in a judgment of 6 March 1995.', '38. On 4 August 1993, in further defamation proceedings instituted by the crew of the Harmoni, the Oslo City Court declared null and void a statement to the effect that seals had been skinned alive, which had been transmitted by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation on 16 and 18 July 1988.']","['II. relevant domestic law and practice', '39. Under Norwegian defamation law, there are three kinds of response to unlawful defamation, namely the imposition of a penalty under the provisions of the Penal Code, an order under its Article 253 declaring the defamatory allegation null and void ( mortifikasjon ) and an order under the Damage Compensation Act 1969 to pay compensation to the aggrieved party. Only the latter two were at issue in the present case.', '40. Under Article 253 of the Penal Code, a defamatory statement which is unlawful and has not been proved true may be declared null and void by a court. In so far as relevant this provision reads:', '“1. When evidence of the truth of an allegation is admissible and such evidence has not been produced, the aggrieved person may demand that the allegation be declared null and void unless otherwise provided by statute.”', '“1. Når det har vært adgang til å føre bevis for sannheten av en beskyldning og beviset ikke er ført, kan den fornærmete forlange at beskyldningen blir erklært død og maktesløs (mortifisert) dersom ikke annet følger av lov.”', 'Such a declaration is applicable only with regard to factual statements, the truth of value judgments not being susceptible of proof.', 'Although the provisions on orders declaring a statement null and void are contained in the Penal Code, such an order is not considered a criminal sanction but a judicial finding that the defendant has failed to prove its truth and is thus viewed as a civil-law remedy.', 'In recent years there has been a debate in Norway as to whether one should abolish the remedy of null and void orders, which has existed in Norwegian law since the sixteenth century and which may also be found in the laws of Denmark and Iceland. Because of its being deemed a particularly lenient form of sanction, the Norwegian Association of Editors has expressed a wish to maintain it.', '41. The conditions for holding a defendant liable for defamation are set out in Chapter 23 of the Penal Code, Article 247 of which provides:', '“Article 247. Any person who, by word or deed, behaves in a manner that is likely to harm another person’s good name and reputation or to expose him to hatred, contempt, or loss of the confidence necessary for his position or business, or who is accessory thereto, shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. If the defamation is committed in print or in broadcasting or otherwise under especially aggravating circumstances, imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years may be imposed.”', '“§ 247. Den som i ord eller handling optrer på en måte som er egnet til å skade en annens gode navn og rykte eller til å utsette ham for hat, ringeakt eller tap av den for hans stilling eller næring fornødne tillit, eller som medvirker dertil, straffes med bøter eller med fengsel inntil 1 år. Er ærekrenkelsen forøvet i trykt skrift eller i kringkastingssending eller ellers under særdeles skjerpende omstendigheter, kan fengsel inntil 2 år anvendes.”', '42. A limitation to the applicability of Article 247 follows from the requirement that the expression must be “unlawful” (“ rettsstridig ”). While this is expressly stated in Article 246, Article 247 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include such a requirement.', 'In a civil case concerning pre-trial reporting by a newspaper, the Supreme Court found for the newspaper, relying on the reservation of lawfulness ( rettsstridsreservasjonen ), even though the impugned expressions had been deemed defamatory. It held that, in determining the scope of this limitation, particular weight should be attached to whether the case was of public interest, having regard to the nature of the issues and to the kind of parties involved. Furthermore, regard should be had to the context in which, and the background against which, the statements had been made. Moreover, it was of great importance whether the news item had presented the case in a sober and balanced manner and had been aimed at highlighting the subject-matter and the object of the case ( Norsk Retstidende 1990, p. 636, at p. 640).', '43. Further limitations to the application of Article 247 are contained in Article 249, which, in so far as is relevant, reads:', '“Article 249', '1. Punishment may not be imposed under Articles 246 and 247 if evidence proving the truth of the accusations is adduced.', '…”', '“ § 249.', '1. Straff efter §§ 246 og 247 kommer ikke til anvendelse dersom det føres bevis for beskyldningens sannhet.', '...”', '44. As regards the requirement of proof under Article 249 § 1, the same standard which applies to the author of a libellous statement applies in principle also to a person who disseminates it. It is not clear under Norwegian law whether the criminal-law standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt or the civil-law standard of balance of probability applies. The applicants have referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court, in which it accepted the standard applied by the lower court in a criminal libel case concerning allegations made in a television programme and a newspaper that a private practising lawyer had recommended his spouse to commit tax offences in connection with a property sale. In view of the seriousness of the accusation, it was found appropriate in that case to apply the same standard of proof as would apply to a public prosecutor in criminal proceedings on tax evasion. Leading legal writers are of the opinion that the truth of a defamatory accusation of theft must, in order to discharge the defendant from liability, be proved according to the same standard as would apply to the prosecution in a theft case. According to Professor Mæland, it would be reasonable to increase the burden of proof according to the seriousness of the defamatory statement. Professor Andenæs and Professor Bratholm have expressed the view that, although there may be good reasons for imposing a strict burden of proof in libel cases, in certain circumstances it may be justified to apply a somewhat less strict standard than in criminal cases, for instance where the victim of the libel has behaved in a particularly reprehensible manner (see, H.J. Mæland, Ærekrenkelser, Universitetsforlaget, 1986, pp. 178-79; and J. Andenæs and A. Bratholm, Spesiell strafferett, Universitetsforlaget, 1983, p. 196).', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '45. Bladet Tromsø A/S and Mr Pål Stensaas lodged an application (no. 21980/93) with the Commission on 10 December 1992. They complained that the District Court’s judgment constituted an unjustified interference with their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, which provision had therefore been violated.', '46. The Commission declared the application admissible on 26 May 1997. In its report of 9 July 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (twenty-four votes to seven). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [4].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '47. At the hearing on 27 January 1999 the Government invited the Court to hold that, as submitted in their memorial, there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', '48. On the same occasion the applicants reiterated their request to the Court to find a violation of Article 10 and to make an award of just satisfaction under Article 41.', 'THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 of the Convention', '49. The applicants complained that the Nord-Troms District Court’s judgment of 4 March 1992, against which the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal on 18 July 1992, had constituted an unjustified interference with their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, which reads:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '50. It was common ground between those appearing before the Court that the impugned measures constituted an “interference by [a] public authority” with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under the first paragraph of Article 10. Furthermore, there was no dispute that the interference was “prescribed by law” and pursued a legitimate aim, namely “the protection of the reputation or rights of others” and thus fulfilled two of the conditions for regarding the interference as permissible under the second paragraph of this Article. The Court arrives at the same conclusion on these issues.', 'The dispute in the case under consideration relates to the third condition, that the interference be “necessary in a democratic society”. The applicants and the Commission argued that this condition had not been complied with and that Article 10 had therefore been violated. The Government contested this contention.', 'A. Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '1. The applicants and the Commission', '51. For the Commission, with which the applicants essentially agreed, the impugned statements in Bladet Tromsø, which had all been based on Mr Lindberg’s report, bore on a matter of serious public concern. The essential aim of the various articles had not been to damage the reputation of those engaged in the seal hunting industry but to initiate a debate as to the proper means of ensuring its survival through compliance with the relevant regulations and, where necessary, by amending those rules so as to improve seal hunting and its image.', 'The allegations in issue had effectively been directed against only seven out of the seventeen members of the Harmoni ’s crew and their names had been deleted in the report as reproduced. The reproduction of Mr Lindberg’s report in Bladet Tromsø had been preceded by the crew members’ own appeal that the report be disclosed to the public.', 'In a spirit of dialogue, the applicants had invited the crew members and various representatives of the government and the seal hunting industry to comment on Mr Lindberg’s statements both before and after his report was published in Bladet Tromsø.', 'The Commission further emphasised that, as representatives of the press, the applicants were entitled to rely on, and could not be expected to verify, the observations which Mr Lindberg had conveyed to them in his capacity as a ministry-appointed official and which related directly to his mission on board the Harmoni (see paragraph 7 above). In so far as the applicants were required to establish the truth of Mr Lindberg’s statements (see paragraph 35 above), they were faced with an unreasonable, if not impossible, task.', 'The contested measures could not afford any significant further protection of the seal hunters’ reputation and rights, since, firstly, at the time of the District Court’s judgment the contents of Mr Lindberg’s report had already been in the public domain for a year and a half and had been divulged (without disclosing the seal hunters’ identities) through a number of other publications, including the Commission of Inquiry report (see paragraph 31 above); secondly, the seal hunters had successfully challenged various passages in Mr Lindberg’s report in defamation proceedings against him (see paragraph 32 above).', '52. The applicants maintained that the District Court’s judgment was inadequate in that it failed to place the statements in question in the larger context of the controversy about the hunting expedition (see paragraphs 29 ‑ 30 above). Rather than causing harm to their reputation, the effect of the Lindberg report had been to increase public support for seal hunters.', 'The impugned statements did not concern the private affairs of private persons. The burden of proof of a defendant facing a claim for a null and void order was quite strict (see paragraph 44 above). None of the impugned statements had been proved untrue (see paragraph 35 above).', '2. The Government', '53. The Government stressed that the present case concerned a conflict between two human rights – on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression and, on the other hand, the right of an individual to protection against unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation, the latter being', 'expressly guaranteed under Article 17 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.', 'The Government argued mainly that Bladet Tromsø had launched a serious attack on the reputation and honour of the seal hunters by breaking the news about the report in a sensational manner on 15 July 1988 and reproducing very serious accusations of cruel and unlawful behaviour during the hunt (see paragraph 12 above). While not contesting that seal hunting was an issue of public interest, the Government pointed out that it would have been possible for the newspaper to take part in public discussion on the matter without attacking the crew members of the Harmoni personally. The impugned allegations had been directed against a small group of persons who could easily be identified because of the newspaper’s reference to the crew of the Harmoni (see paragraph 12 above). These persons could not be regarded as public figures.', 'In the view of the Government, the newspaper could hardly be said to have acted in good faith. The applicants were aware that Mr Lindberg’s report had been exempted from public disclosure and that this decision had been taken temporarily in order to protect the individuals who had been accused of having committed inhuman and criminal acts, by giving them an opportunity to reply to the accusations (see paragraph 11 above). This measure must be seen in the light of the right of every person, including the seal hunters, under Article 6 § 2 to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty. It also suggested that the report did not necessarily present the Government’s official view. Moreover, as found by the District Court, even the journalist in question had considered the allegation that seals had been flayed alive too unreasonable to be true (see paragraph 35 above).', '54. The Government further disputed that the news coverage had been based on an accurate factual basis. The District Court, having assessed the evidence, found it obvious that the statements had not been proved (see paragraph 35 above).', 'Nor could the applicants reasonably consider that the information derived from Mr Lindberg’s report was reliable, as they were aware of the fact that his qualifications had been questioned when it was published (see paragraphs 15, 20 and 26 above).', '55. Furthermore, it could not be said that Bladet Tromsø complied with ethics of journalism. Under the Norwegian Code of Press Ethics, a person who is subject to serious criticism should as far as possible have an opportunity to reply simultaneously. The journalist has a duty to verify the truth of the information, which task would have been neither impossible nor unreasonable in the instant case. The allegations that seals had been skinned alive could have been verified by consulting an expert. However, no investigation had been undertaken by the newspaper (see paragraph 35 above).', 'The finding by the Commission that the publication of the report by Bladet Tromsø had been preceded by the crew members’ own appeal to this effect was not correct (see paragraph 15 above). In any event, their demand was put forward after most of the damaging information had been made public, namely on 15 July 1988 (see paragraph 12 above). Nor was it correct that, prior to its being published, the applicants had invited the crew to comment on Mr Lindberg’s report.', '56. Finally, the Government pointed out that the impugned interference had not been of a criminal-law character; rather, the domestic court’s finding had entailed a civil liability for the applicants to pay damages and meant that they had been unable to prove the truth of the allegations (see paragraph 40 above).', '57. In the light of the foregoing, the Government were of the view that the domestic court had acted within its margin of appreciation and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued and the interference complained of.', 'B. The Court’s assessment', '1. General principles', '58. According to the Court’s well-established case-law, the test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see the Sunday Times (no. 1) v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 38, § 62). In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '59. One factor of particular importance for the Court’s determination in the present case is the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31; and the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38). In cases such as the present one the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of “public watchdog” in imparting information of serious public concern (see the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 500, § 39).', '60. In sum, the Court’s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 45, ECHR 1999-I).', '2. Application of those principles to the present case', '61. In the instant case the Nord-Troms District Court found that two statements published by Bladet Tromsø on 15 July 1988 and four statements published on 20 July were defamatory, “unlawful” and not proved to be true. One statement – “Seals skinned alive” – was deemed to mean that the seal hunters had committed acts of cruelty to the animals. Another was understood to imply that seal hunters had committed criminal assault on and threat against the seal hunting inspector. The remaining statements were seen to suggest that some (unnamed) seal hunters had killed four harp seals, the hunting of which was illegal in 1988. The District Court declared the statements null and void and, considering that the newspaper had acted negligently, ordered the applicants to pay compensation to the seventeen plaintiffs (see paragraph 35 above).', 'The Court finds that the reasons relied on by the District Court were relevant to the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of the crew members.', '62. As to the sufficiency of those reasons for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention, the Court must take account of the overall background against which the statements in question were made. Thus, the contents of the impugned articles cannot be looked at in isolation of the controversy that seal hunting represented at the time in Norway and in Tromsø, the centre of the trade in Norway. It should further be recalled that Article 10 is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population (see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49). Moreover, whilst the mass media must not overstep the bounds imposed in the interests of the protection of the reputation of private individuals, it is incumbent on them to impart information and ideas concerning matters of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Consequently, in order to determine whether the interference was based on sufficient reasons which rendered it “necessary”, regard must be had to the public-interest aspect of the case.', '63. In this connection the Court has noted the argument, relied on by the District Court (see paragraph 35 above), that Bladet Tromsø ’s manner of presentation, in particular in the article of 15 July 1988 (see paragraph 12 above), suggested that the primary aim, rather than being the promotion of a serious debate, was to focus in a sensationalist fashion on specific allegations of crime and to be the first paper to print the story.', 'In the Court’s view, however, the manner of reporting in question should not be considered solely by reference to the disputed articles in Bladet Tromsø on 15 and 20 July 1988 but in the wider context of the newspaper’s coverage of the seal hunting issue (see paragraphs 8-9, 12-19, 21-24 above). During the period from 15 to 23 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø, which was a local newspaper with – presumably – a relatively stable readership, published almost on a daily basis the different points of views, including the newspaper’s own comments, those of the Ministry of Fisheries, the Norwegian Sailors’ Federation, Greenpeace and, above all, the seal hunters (see paragraphs 12-19, 21-24 above). Although the latter were not published simultaneously with the contested articles, there was a high degree of proximity in time, giving an overall picture of balanced news reporting. This approach was not too different from that followed three months earlier in the first series of articles on Mr Lindberg’s initial accusations and no criticism appears to have been made against the newspaper in respect of those articles. As the Court observed in a previous judgment, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the medium in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see the Jersild judgment cited above, p. 23, § 31).', 'Against this background, it appears that the thrust of the impugned articles was not primarily to accuse certain individuals of committing offences against the seal hunting regulations or of cruelty to animals. On the contrary, the call by the paper on 18 July 1988 (see paragraph 16 above) for the fisheries authorities to make a “constructive use” of the findings in the Lindberg report in order to improve the reputation of seal hunting can reasonably be seen as an aim underlying the various articles published on the subject by Bladet Tromsø. The impugned articles were part of an ongoing debate of evident concern to the local, national and international public, in which the views of a wide selection of interested actors were reported.', '64. The most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court is called for when, as in the present case, the measures taken or sanctions imposed by the national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern (see the Jersild judgment cited above, pp. 25-26, § 35).', '65. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is question of attacking the reputation of private individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. As pointed out by the Government, the seal hunters’ right to protection of their honour and reputation is itself internationally recognised under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention the seal hunters had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see the Goodwin judgment cited above, p. 500, § 39, and Fressoz and Roire cited above, § 54).', '66. The Court notes that the expressions in question consisted of factual statements, not value-judgments (cf., for instance, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 28, § 46). They did not emanate from the newspaper itself but were based on or were directly quoting from the Lindberg report, which the newpaper had not verified by independent research (see the Jersild judgment cited above, pp. 23 and 25-26, §§ 31 and 35). It must therefore be examined whether there were any special grounds in the present case for dispensing the newspaper from its ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that were defamatory of private individuals. In the Court’s view, this depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation at hand and the extent to which the newspaper could reasonably regard the Lindberg report as reliable with respect to the allegations in question. The latter issue must be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to Bladet Tromsø at the material time (see paragraphs 7-19, 25-26 above), rather than with the benefit of hindsight, on the basis of the findings of fact made by the Commission of Inquiry a long time thereafter (see paragraph 31 above).', '67. As regards the nature and degree of the defamation, the Court observes that the four statements (items 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6) to the effect that certain sealers had killed female harp seals were found defamatory, not because they implied that the hunters had committed acts of cruelty to the animals, but because the hunting of such seals was illegal in 1988, unlike the year before (see paragraphs 13 and 35 above). According to the District Court, “the statements [did] not differ from allegations of illegal hunting in general” (see paragraph 35 above). Whilst these allegations implied reprehensible conduct, they were not particularly serious.', 'The other two allegations – that seals had been skinned alive and that furious hunters had beaten up Mr Lindberg and threatened to hit him with a gaff (items 2.1 and 2.2) – were more serious but were expressed in rather broad terms and could be understood by readers as having been presented with a degree of exaggeration (see paragraph 12 above).', 'More importantly, while Bladet Tromsø publicised the names of the ten crew members whom Mr Lindberg had exonerated, it named none of those accused of having committed the reprehensible acts (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). Before the District Court each plaintiff pleaded his case on the basis of the same facts and the District Court apparently considered each of them to have been exposed to the same degree of defamation, as is reflected in the fact that an equal award was made to each of them (see paragraph 35 above).', 'Thus, while some of the accusations were relatively serious, the potential adverse effect of the impugned statements on each individual seal hunter’s reputation or rights was significantly attenuated by several factors. In particular, the criticism was not an attack against all the crew members or any specific crew member (see the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 28, § 66).', '68. As regards the second issue, the trustworthiness of the Lindberg report, it should be observed that the report had been drawn up by Mr Lindberg in an official capacity as an inspector appointed by the Ministry of Fisheries to monitor the seal hunt performed by the crew of the Harmoni during the 1988 season (see paragraph 7 above). In the view of the Court, the press should normally be entitled, when contributing to public debate on matters of legitimate concern, to rely on the contents of official reports without having to undertake independent research. Otherwise, the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined (see, mutatis mutandis, the Goodwin judgment cited above, p. 500, § 39).', '69. The Court does not attach significance to any discrepancies, pointed to by the Government, between the report and the publications made by Mr Lindberg in Bladet Tromsø one year before in quite a different capacity, namely as a freelance journalist and an author.', '70. The newspaper was, it is true, already aware from the reactions to Mr Lindberg’s statements in April 1988 that the crew disputed his competence and the truth of any allegations of “beastly killing methods” (see paragraph 9 above). It must have been evident to the paper that the Lindberg report was liable to be controverted by the crew members. Taken on its own, this cannot be considered decisive for whether the newspaper had a duty to verify the truth of the critical factual statements contained in the report before it could exercise its freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.', '71. Far more material for this purpose was the attitude of the Ministry of Fisheries, which had appointed Mr Lindberg to carry out the inspection and to report back (see paragraph 7 above). As at 15 July 1988 Bladet Tromsø was aware of the fact that the Ministry had decided to exempt the report from public disclosure with reference to the nature of the allegations – criminal conduct – and to the need to give the persons named in the report an opportunity to comment (see paragraph 11 above). It has not been suggested that, by publishing the relevant information, the newspaper was acting in breach of the law on confidentiality. Nor does it appear that, prior to the contested publication on 15 July 1988, the Ministry had publicly expressed a doubt as to the possible truth of the criticism or questioned Mr Lindberg’s competence. Rather, according to a bulletin of the same date by the Norwegian News Agency, the Ministry had stated that it was possible that illegal hunting had occurred (see paragraph 25 above).', 'On 18 July 1988 the Norwegian News Agency reported the Ministry as having stated that veterinary experts would consider the controversial Lindberg report and that the Ministry would issue information of the outcome and possibly also of the circumstances of Mr Lindberg’s recruitment as inspector; and, moreover, that the Ministry would not comment any further until it had collected more information (see paragraph 26 above). On 19 July the News Agency reported that the Ministry had believed, on the basis of information provided by Mr Lindberg himself, that his research background was far more extensive than it was in reality. It was on 20 July, the same date as the last of the disputed publications, that the Ministry expressed doubts as to Mr Lindberg’s competence and the quality of the report (see paragraph 20 above).', 'In the Court’s opinion, the attitude expressed by the Ministry before 20 July 1988 does not constitute a ground for considering that it was unreasonable for the newspaper to regard as reliable the information contained in the report, including the four statements published on 20 July to the effect that specific but unnamed seal hunters had killed female harp seals (see paragraph 13 above). In fact, the District Court later found that one such allegation (item 1.5) had been proved true (see paragraph 35 above).', '72. Having regard to the various factors limiting the likely harm to the individual seal hunters’ reputation and to the situation as it presented itself to Bladet Tromsø at the relevant time, the Court considers that the paper could reasonably rely on the official Lindberg report, without being required to carry out its own research into the accuracy of the facts reported. It sees no reason to doubt that the newspaper acted in good faith in this respect.', '73. On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot find that the crew members’ undoubted interest in protecting their reputation was sufficient to outweigh the vital public interest in ensuring an informed public debate over a matter of local and national as well as international interest. In short, the reasons relied on by the respondent State, although relevant, are not sufficient to show that the interference complained of was “necessary in a democratic society”. Notwithstanding the national authorities’ margin of appreciation, the Court considers that there was no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restrictions placed the applicants’ right to freedom of expression and the legitimate aim pursued. Accordingly, the Court holds that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'II. application of article 41 of the Convention', '74. Bladet Tromsø A/S and Mr Pål Stensaas sought just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '75. Under the head of pecuniary damage, the applicants requested compensation for the economic loss which they had suffered as a result of the District Court’s judgment of 4 March 1992 ordering them to pay 187,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK) in damages to the plaintiffs and NOK 136,342 to cover the latter’s costs before the District Court.', '76. Subject to the Court finding a violation of the Convention, the Government did not contest the above claim. The Delegate of the Commission did not offer any comment.', '77. The Court, being satisfied that there was a causal link between the damage claimed and the violation found of the Convention, awards the totality of the sum sought under this head.', 'B. Costs and expenses', '78. The applicants further claimed reimbursement of costs and expenses, totalling NOK 652,229 in respect of the following items:', '(i) NOK 138,887 for their costs and expenses in the proceedings before the District Court;', '(ii) NOK 29,560 for their costs and expenses in the appeal to the Supreme Court;', '(iii) NOK 150,000 for work (128 hours at NOK 1,000 and 20 hours at NOK 1,100) by Mr Wolland in the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions until 28 August 1998;', '(iv) NOK 79,200 for work (60 hours at 100 pounds sterling (GBP) per hour) by Mr Boyle during the aforementioned period;', '(v) NOK 23,840 for expenses incurred in the Strasbourg proceedings until 28 August 1998;', '(vi) NOK 104,500 for work (95 hours at NOK 1,100) by Mr Wolland from 29 August 1998 until and including the Court’s hearing on 27 January 1999;', '(vii) NOK 26,481 in expenses (travel, accommodation and miscellaneous) incurred by Mr Wolland in connection with the above;', '(viii) NOK 68,330 for work (46 hours at GBP 100 per hour) by Mr Boyle and expenses (travel, accommodation and miscellaneous) incurred by him from 29 August 1998 until and including the Court’s hearing on 27 January 1999;', '(ix) NOK 17,551 for travel and accommodation expenses incurred in connection with Mr Y. Nielsen’s (current chief editor of Bladet Tromsø ) attendance at the hearing;', '(x) NOK 13,880 for travel and accommodation expenses incurred in connection with Mr Stensaas’s attendance at the hearing.', '79. The Government contested the above claim, arguing that the number of hours and the rates were excessive. The Delegate of the Commission also in this context left the matter to the Court’s discretion.', '80. The Court, in accordance with its case-law, will consider whether the costs and expenses were actually and necessarily incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the matter found to constitute a violation of the Convention and were reasonable as to quantum (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, p. 83, § 77). It is satisfied that the hourly rates charged in the Strasbourg proceedings were reasonable but finds the number of hours claimed excessive. Making an assessment on an equitable basis the Court awards the applicants NOK 80,000 with respect to the work by Mr Wolland and NOK 40,000 with regard to the work by Mr Boyle in the Strasbourg proceedings. The remainder of the claim for costs and expenses is to be reimbursed in its entirety.', 'C. Interest pending the proceedings before the national courts and the Convention institutions', '81. The applicants in addition claimed NOK 515,337 in interest (18% per year until 1 January 1994 and then 12% per year until 1 November 1998) on the amounts claimed in respect of pecuniary damage and of costs and expenses incurred until 28 August 1998.', '82. The Government observed that it was difficult, on the basis of the breakdown of the applicants’ claim to verify the accuracy of the calculations of interest. The latter had been based on the Act on Default Interest 1976 ( morarenteloven, Law no. 100 of 17 December 1976). It included a penalty element and clearly exceeded the ordinary level of interest in Norway. The said Act could not, in their submission, constitute a basis for the assessment of an award under Article 41 of the Convention.', '83. The Court finds that the applicants must have suffered some pecuniary loss by reason of the periods that elapsed from the times when the various costs were incurred until the Court’s award (see, for instance, the Darby v. Sweden judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187, p. 14, § 38, and the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 38, § 80 (d)). It does not consider itself bound by the national law on the calculation of interest nor does it propose to undertake a precise quantification of the loss sustained by the applicants in the present case.

Mr Hüseyin Karataş is a Turk of Kurdish origin and was born in 1963. He lives in Istanbul and works as a psychologist.', '9. In November 1991 he published an anthology of poems in Istanbul entitled “The song of a rebellion – Dersim [3] ” (“ Dersim – Bir İsyanın Türküsü ”).', '10. On 8 January 1992, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court no. 1 (“the public prosecutor”, “the National Security Court”) accused the applicant and his publisher of disseminating propaganda against the “indivisible unity of the State”. He requested, inter alia, application of section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 18 below) and the confiscation of the copies of the work concerned (see paragraph 16 below). He relied on the following passages from that anthology in support of his request.', '“…', '[Freedom is the law of the clan]', '… a great passion is taking shapein our holy hands – the light of ancient Kurdistanfor as long as by the light of day the Munzursuyu [ [4] ] is not reddened by our bloodwe shall not let the whelps of the Ottoman whore trample upon itafter allfor thousands of years we have obeyed the lawfreedom is the law of the clan.', '[In solitude, they looked at the tombstones]', 'The heart of Dersim is torn to piecesits serpentine streetsexplosions of dynamitethe noise of excavators the soldiers’ boots … a phial of medicine in one hand of poison in the other the towers of Babel in others the Turks are coming with their schools their language in which we know only too well the word for cruelty … in the corridors of Parliament in the galleries in the garrisons they are preparing genocide like those who know no bounds … On the head of Hızır [ [5] ], my brave onewe have never seen nor heard anything like this I ask you, brother, what Scripture would accept such cruelty? …', '[Silently, they looked towards the village of Deşt] … and now cruelty is spreading apaceour blood will mix with the blood shed. resistance and betrayalfreedom and surrender side by side … have we not accepted as law for thousands of yearsthat blood shall be washed in blood? …', '[In their solitude their tears fell to the ground] … thousands of years of disasters have not altered our lives for our Kurdistanfor our Dersimwe will sacrifice our heads, drunk on the fire of rebellion …', '[In solitude, they oiled the guns and rifles] … let us gochildren of the unyieldingwe have heard there is a rebellion in the mountainscan we hear and do nothing? let the festivities and celebrations beginlet flames as high as the rooftops reach for the skyso that before the day’s end the cannons fall silent venerable Kurdistan beautiful KurdistanKurdistan our friend …', '[They marched towards the laws to be brothers] … for thousands of years, companion, we have been the close acquaintance of the most barbaric cruelties I ask you out of love for the age in which you live how much longer will we put up with this cruelty? … to the majestic mountains that will lead us to freedom …', '[Snowy are the mountains] … the whelps of the Ottoman whorerepeatedly pound our mountains the waters that run our springtime … they are preparing genocide like those who know no bounds. … for thousands of years, our clan has been under siege in our besieged land …', '[The mountains before us have voices of snow] … an unbounded anger in my heart a speechless hatred … the laws do not give wayrebellion comes from the mountainsthe millennia of historysome have died for her some march to their deaths.', '[They marched towards solitude] … those who were but a handful of brave men the hope and resistance of their blessed bodies they have, piece by piece, adorned freedom those who, before us, marched to their deaths … Young Kurds ‘I am seventy-five years old I die a martyr I join the martyrs of KurdistanDersim has been defeated but Kurdismand Kurdistan shall live onthe young Kurd shall take vengeance’ when life leaves this body my heart shall not cry out What happiness to live this day to join the martyrs of Kurdistan. …', '[Alişer is dead too] … we have lived for centuries without a State, in exile, during massacres for centuries along the paths we have hauled behind us a sword but never have we been conquered by the sword … the venerable Sheikh Alişer of Hasanan [ [6] ] was brave enough to know how to die for his honour, his homeland andhis freedom … how can I narrate to those who will come after us all that is brave and heroic impregnating my whole body with courage. … I invite you to freedom, to death in these mountains, in this sacred spring with death we march, freedom is blessed with death, I invite you to die; – time is wounded like the beat of a heart. …', '[Exile] … Garrisonsgarrison schoolskidswomen … valiant youthssongs of revengemothers of childrenhand-to-hand side by sidesurrender and resistanceand the dignityand the honourand the pride of the Kurdbecomeby the vowsof the Mazlum Doğans [ [7] ] of the Ali Haydar Yıldızesof the Hayri Durmuşesof the Delil Doğanslittle by little drop by drop a secret rebellion.”', '11. The applicant denied the charges before the National Security Court, asserting, in particular, that the passage in inverted commas (see paragraph 10 above) was a quotation which in no way reflected his own opinions.', '12.

In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decision included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified.', 'Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty, namely: 1991/23 – 75 – 132 – 177 – 100; 1992/33 – 62 – 73 – 89 – 143; 1993/29 – 30 – 38 – 39 – 82 – 94 – 114; 1994/3 – 6 – 12 – 14 – 68 – 108 – 131 – 141 – 155 – 171 – 172; 1995/1 – 25 – 29 – 37 – 48 – 64 – 67 – 84 – 88 – 92 – 96 – 101 – 120 – 124 – 134 – 135; 1996/2 – 8 – 18 – 21 – 34 – 38 – 42 – 43 – 49 – 54 – 73 – 86 – 91 – 103 – 119 – 353; 1997/11 – 19 – 32 – 33 – 82 – 89 – 113 – 118 – 130 – 140 – 148 – 152 – 153 – 154 – 187 – 191 – 200 – 606; 1998/6 – 8 – 50 – 51 – 56 – 85 – 162.', 'As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the objective nature of the words used.', '23. The applicant supplied a list of works that had led to prosecutions in the National Security Courts together with general information on sentences that had been handed down and proceedings then pending against a number of writers and publishers.

Mr Karataş applied to the Commission on 27 August 1993. He submitted that he had been denied a fair trial before the National Security Court as it could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He also maintained that his conviction for the publication of his poems constituted a violation of Articles 9 and 10.', '31. The Commission declared the application (no. 23168/94) admissible on 14 October 1996. In its report of 11 December 1997 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 10 (twenty-six votes to six), considered jointly with Article 9, and that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (thirty-one votes to one).', 'Extracts from the Commission’s opinion and the three partly dissenting opinions contained in the report are reproduced as an annex to this judgment [8].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '32. In their memorial and at the hearing, the Government asked the Court to dismiss Mr Karataş’s application on the ground that there had been no violation of Articles 6 § 1, 9 or 10 of the Convention.', '33. The applicant invited the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Articles 6 § 1, 9 and 10 of the Convention and complained, in substance, of a breach of Article 7. He also sought just satisfaction under Article 41.', 'THE LAW', 'I. scope of the case', '34. Before the Court the applicant also complained of a breach of Article 7 of the Convention. The Court observes, however, that as Mr Karataş did not raise that complaint at the admissibility stage of the procedure before the Commission (see paragraph 30 above), it has no jurisdiction to examine it (see, mutatis mutandis, the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 277-78, § 63).', 'II. ALLEGED violation of Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention', '35. In his application Mr Karataş submitted that his conviction pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) had breached Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention. At the hearing before the Court, however, he did not object to this complaint being considered from the standpoint of Article 10 alone, as it had been before the Commission (see paragraph 31 above). In that connection, the Court reiterates that since it is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, it does not consider itself bound by the characterisation given by an applicant, a government or the Commission (see the Guerra and Others v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 223, § 44).', 'Article 10 of the Convention provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '36. Those appearing before the Court agreed that the applicant’s conviction amounted to an “interference” with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Such an interference breaches Article 10 unless it satisfies the requirements of the second paragraph of that provision. The Court must therefore determine whether it was “prescribed by law”, was directed towards one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve the aims concerned.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '37. The applicant did not express a view on this point.', '38. The Government submitted that the constitutive elements of the offence under section 8 had been clarified by the amendment made to that provision by Law no. 4126. Section 8 was now sufficiently explicit. The applicant had benefited from that amendment as his case had been reviewed after the entry into force of Law no. 4126 (see paragraph 19 above).', '39. The Delegate of the Commission observed at the hearing before the Court that the wording of section 8 was rather vague and that it might be questioned whether it satisfied the conditions of clarity and foreseeability inherent in the prescribed-by-law requirement. He noted however that the Commission had accepted that section 8 formed a sufficient legal basis for the applicant’s conviction and concluded that the interference was “prescribed by law”.', '40. The Court notes the concern of the Delegate about the vagueness of section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). However, like the Commission, the Court accepts that since the applicant’s conviction was based on section 8 of Law no. 3713 the resultant interference with his right to freedom of expression could be regarded as “prescribed by law”.', '2. Legitimate aim', '41. The Government submitted that the aim of the interference in issue had been not only to maintain “national security” and prevent “[public] disorder”, as the Commission had found, but also to preserve “territorial integrity” and “national unity”.', '42. The Commission for its part considered that the applicant’s conviction was part of the authorities’ efforts to combat illegal terrorist activities and to maintain national security and public safety, which are legitimate aims under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.', '43. The applicant accepted that the aim of the interference could have been to prevent “disorder”.', '44. The Court considers that, having regard to the sensitivity of the security situation in south-east Turkey (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2539, § 10) and to the need for the authorities to be alert to acts capable of fuelling additional violence, the measures taken against the applicant can be said to have been in furtherance of certain of the aims mentioned by the Government, namely the protection of national security and territorial integrity and the prevention of disorder and crime. This is certainly true where, as with the situation in south-east Turkey at the time of the circumstances of this case, the separatist movement had recourse to methods which rely on the use of violence.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '(i) The applicant', '45. The applicant asserted that the real reason for his conviction was that he had referred to the Kurds and “Kurdistan” in his poems. Thus, his only crime, in the eyes of the authorities, was that he had not followed the official line.', 'However, it had to be borne in mind that the work in issue was an anthology of poems in which the author had expressed his thoughts, anger, feelings and joys through colourful language that contained some hyperbole. The book was therefore first and foremost a literary work and should be treated as such.', '(ii) The Government', '46. The Government maintained that the applicant’s poems contributed to separatist propaganda. Article 10 left Contracting States a particularly broad margin of appreciation in cases where their territorial integrity was threatened by terrorism and, as in the instant case, the interference only affected the rights of a few isolated individuals. It was in that spirit, for example, that the New Criminal Code in France, which came into force on 1 March 1994 had, in its Article 410.1, clearly defined the fundamental interests of the nation to include independence, territorial integrity, security, the republican nature of its institutions, defence, diplomacy and the protection of people in France and overseas. Those were spheres in which the States’ margin of appreciation was traditionally wider. What is more, when confronted with the situation in Turkey – where the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan) systematically carried out massacres of women, children, schoolteachers and conscripts – the Turkish authorities had a duty to prohibit all separatist propaganda, which could only incite to violence and hostility between society’s various component groups and thus endanger human rights and democracy.', '(iii) The Commission', '47. The Commission likewise adverted to the “duties and responsibilities” mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 10, which made it important for people expressing an opinion in public on sensitive political issues to ensure that they did not condone “unlawful political violence”. Freedom of expression nevertheless included the right to engage in open discussion of difficult problems like those with which Turkey was confronted with a view to analysing, for example, the underlying causes of the situation or to expressing opinions on possible solutions.', 'The Commission considered that a special feature in the present case was the fact that the applicant had chosen to express himself through poetry. However, even taking into account the prerogatives of a poet, it found that parts of the applicant’s poems glorified armed rebellion against the Turkish State and martyrdom in that fight. Read in context, some of the expressions used were capable of creating among readers the impression that the applicant was encouraging, or even calling for, an armed struggle against the Turkish State and was supporting violence for separatist purposes. Consequently, the Turkish authorities had been entitled to consider that the poems were harmful to national security and public safety. In those circumstances, the applicant’s conviction and the penalty imposed on him could reasonably be regarded as answering a pressing social need and, consequently, as being necessary in a democratic society.', '(b) The Court’s assessment', '48. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles underlying its judgments relating to Article 10, as set out, for example, in the Zana judgment (cited above, pp. 2547-48, § 51) and in Fressoz and Roire v. France ([GC], no. 29183/95, § 45, ECHR 1999-I).', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '49. The work in issue contained poems which, through the frequent use of pathos and metaphors, called for self-sacrifice for “Kurdistan” and included some particularly aggressive passages directed at the Turkish authorities. Taken literally, the poems might be construed as inciting readers to hatred, revolt and the use of violence. In deciding whether they in fact did so, it must nevertheless be borne in mind that the medium used by the applicant was poetry, a form of artistic expression that appeals to only a minority of readers.', 'In that connection, the Court observes that Article 10 includes freedom of artistic expression – notably within freedom to receive and impart information and ideas – which affords the opportunity to take part in the public exchange of cultural, political and social information and ideas of all kinds (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 19, § 27). Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence the obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression (ibid., p. 22, § 33). As to the tone of the poems in the present case – which the Court should not be taken to approve – it must be remembered that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, mutatis mutandis, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 236, § 48).', '50. In the instant case, the poems had an obvious political dimension. Using colourful imagery, they expressed deep-rooted discontent with the lot of the population of Kurdish origin in Turkey. In that connection, the Court recalls that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on matters of public interest (see the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1957-58, § 58). Furthermore, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless, it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, pp. 1567-68, § 54). Finally, where such remarks incite to violence against an individual or a public official or a sector of the population, the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression.', '51. The Court takes into account, furthermore, the background to the cases submitted to it, particularly problems linked to the prevention of terrorism (see the Incal judgment cited above, pp. 1568-69, § 58). On that point, it takes note of the Turkish authorities’ concern about the dissemination of views which they consider might exacerbate the serious disturbances that have been going on in Turkey for some fifteen years (see paragraph 44 above).', '52. The Court observes, however, that the applicant is a private individual who expressed his views through poetry – which by definition is addressed to a very small audience – rather than through the mass media, a fact which limited their potential impact on “national security”, “[public] order” and “territorial integrity” to a substantial degree. Thus, even though some of the passages from the poems seem very aggressive in tone and to call for the use of violence, the Court considers that the fact that they were artistic in nature and of limited impact made them less a call to an uprising than an expression of deep distress in the face of a difficult political situation.', 'Furthermore, the Court notes that Mr Karataş was convicted by the National Security Court not so much for having incited to violence, but rather for having disseminated separatist propaganda by referring to a particular region of Turkey as “Kurdistan” and for having glorified the insurrectionary movements in that region (see paragraph 12 above).', '53. Furthermore and above all, the Court is struck by the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant – particularly the fact that he was sentenced to more than thirteen months’ imprisonment – and the persistence of the prosecution’s efforts to secure his conviction. In that regard, it notes that his fine was more than doubled after Law no. 4126 came into force (see paragraph 19 above).', 'The Court notes in that connection that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference.', '54. In conclusion, Mr Karataş’s conviction was disproportionate to the aims pursued and accordingly not “necessary in a democratic society”. There has therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION', '55. The applicant complained that the presence of a military judge on the bench of the National Security Court which tried and convicted him meant that he had been denied a fair hearing in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides:', '“In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ...”', '56. The Government contested that allegation whereas the Commission accepted it.', '57. In the applicant’s submission, the military judges appointed to the National Security Courts such as the Istanbul National Security Court were dependent on the executive, being appointed by the joint decree of the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister, subject to the approval of the President of the Republic. He pointed to the fact that their professional assessment and promotion as well as their security of tenure were within the control of the executive branch and in turn the army. The ties which bound them to the executive and to the army made it impossible for military judges to discharge their functions on the bench in an independent and impartial manner. The applicant further stressed that the independence and impartiality of military judges and hence of the courts on which they sat were compromised since these judges were unable to take a position which might be contradictory to the views of their commanding officers.', 'The applicant stated that these considerations impaired the independence and impartiality of the Istanbul National Security Court and prevented him from receiving a fair trial, in violation of Article 6 § 1.', '58. The Government replied that the rules governing the appointment of military judges to the National Security Courts and the guarantees which they enjoyed in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The Government disputed the applicant’s argument that military judges were accountable to their superior officers. In the first place, it was an offence under Article 112 of the Military Cirminal Code for a public official to attempt to influence the performance by a military judge of his judicial functions (see paragraph 28 above). Secondly, the assessment reports referred to by the applicant related only to conduct of a military judge’s non-judicial duties. Military judges had access to their assessment reports and were able to challenge their content before the Supreme Military Administrative Court (see paragraph 29 above). When acting in a judicial capacity a military judge was assessed in exactly the same manner as a civilian judge.', '59. The Government added that the fact that a military judge had sat in the National Security Court had not impaired the fairness of the applicant’s trial. Neither the military judge’s hierarchical superiors nor the public authorities which had appointed him to the court had any interest in the proceedings or in the outcome of the case.', 'The Government also impressed upon the Court the need to have particular regard to the security context in which the decision to establish National Security Courts was taken pursuant to Article 143 of the Constitution. In view of the experience of the armed forces in the anti-terrorism campaign the authorities had considered it necessary to strengthen these courts by including a military judge in order to provide them with the necessary expertise and knowledge to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State.', '60. The Commission concluded that the Istanbul National Security Court could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Commission referred in this respect to its opinion in the case of Incal v. Turkey as expressed in its report adopted on 25 February 1997 and the reasons supporting that opinion.', '61. The Court recalls that in its Incal judgment cited above and in its Çıraklar v. Turkey judgment of 28 October 1998 ( Reports 1998-VII) the Court had to address arguments similar to those raised by the Government in their pleadings in the instant case. In those judgments the Court noted that the status of military judges sitting as members of National Security Courts did provide some guarantees of independence and impartiality (see the Incal judgment cited above, p. 1571, § 65, and paragraph 25 above). On the other hand, the Court found that certain aspects of these judges’ status made their independence and impartiality questionable (ibid., p. 1572, § 68): for example, the fact that they are servicemen who still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive; the fact that they remain subject to military discipline; and the fact that decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraphs 26-29 above). Mr Karataş mentioned some of these shortcomings in his observations.', '62. As in its Incal judgment the Court considers that its task is not to determine in abstracto the necessity for the establishment of National Security Courts in the light of the justifications advanced by the Government. Its task is to ascertain whether the manner in which the Istanbul National Security Court functioned infringed Mr Karataş’s right to a fair trial, in particular whether, viewed objectively, he had a legitimate reason to fear that the court which tried him lacked independence and impartiality (see the Incal judgment cited above, p. 1572, § 70, and the Çıraklar judgment cited above, pp. 3072-73, § 38).', 'As to that question, the Court sees no reason to reach a conclusion different from that in the cases of Mr Incal and Mr Çıraklar, both of whom, like the present applicant, were civilians. It is understandable that the applicant – prosecuted in a National Security Court for disseminating propaganda aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the State and national unity – should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer, who was a member of the Military Legal Service (see paragraph 27 above). On that account he could legitimately fear that the Istanbul National Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant’s fears as to that court’s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction (see the Incal judgment cite above, p. 1573, § 72 in fine ).', '63. For these reasons the Court finds that there has been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.', 'IV. Application of ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION', '64. The applicant sought just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '65. The applicant claimed 200,000 French francs (FRF) as compensation for the money he would have earned as an editor had he not been in prison.', '66. The Government contended that Mr Karataş had not proved his loss of earnings.', '67. The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view on this point.', '68. The Court finds that there is insufficient proof of a causal link between the violation and the applicant’s alleged loss of earnings. In particular, it has no reliable information on Mr Karataş’s salary. Consequently, it cannot make an award under this head (Rule 60 § 2 of the Rules of Court).', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '69. Mr Karataş sought payment of FRF 100,000 for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered by being deprived of his liberty and separated from his family.', '70. The Government invited the Court to hold that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction.', '71. The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view.', '72. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered a certain amount of distress in the circumstances of the case. Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards him the sum of FRF 40,000 for non-pecuniary damage.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '73. The applicant claimed FRF 100,000 for his costs and expenses, of which FRF 60,000 for his lawyer’s fees (140 hours’ work, plus costs of attendance at the hearing in Strasbourg) and FRF 40,000 to cover telephone, fax, photocopy, translation and secretarial expenses.', '74. The Government found those sums excessive. They submitted, in particular, that the documentary evidence supplied by the applicant did not accurately reflect his claims and that the fees requested exceeded usual rates normally applied in Turkey in similar cases.', '75. On the basis of the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant FRF 20,000, less FRF 10,446,45 paid by the Council of Europe in legal aid.', 'D. Default interest', '76. The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment, which is 3.47% per annum.']",1,tr,001-58274,1

Mr Edip Polat, a Turkish national born in 1962, is a writer and lives in Diyarbakır.', '9. In May 1991 he published in Ankara a book entitled “We made each dawn a Newroz [3] ” ( Nevrozladık Şafakları ). In an epic style he related historical episodes marked by Kurdish rebel movements in Turkey and gave an account, with his own comments, of facts relating in particular to the life of prisoners in Diyarbakır Prison and the ill-treatment they had allegedly been subjected to.', '10. The book was republished in November 1991. On 31 December, on an application by the public prosecutor at the Ankara National Security Court (“the National Security Court”), the Ankara Court of First Instance ordered the seizure of the copies published as an interim measure in the context of a criminal investigation opened in respect of Mr Polat.', '11. In an indictment of 22 April 1992 the public prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of disseminating propaganda against the territorial integrity of the State and the indivisible unity of the nation, within the meaning of section 8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 19 below). According to the public prosecutor, Mr Polat’s book was inspired by hatred of the Turkish State and lauded Kurdish separatism. In reaching that conclusion, he noted that both the “separatist bandits” of the PKK and the rebel troops of Sheik Said [4] were described in the book as “Kurdish patriots” and that the regime at the time which had put down the insurrection of 1925 had been called a “fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie” and was alleged to have implemented an expansionist policy which had led to infringement of the Kurds’ fundamental rights and annexation of their territory.', 'He also accused the applicant of contravening section 6(1) of Law no. 3713 by divulging the identity of the staff of Diyarbakır Prison – who, he submitted, having been presented as torturers, ran the risk of reprisals – and the forensic pathologists, whose signatures appeared on the death certificates reproduced in the book.', 'In support of his submissions, the public prosecutor quoted extracts [5] from the book, whose confiscation he also sought.', '12. Before the National Security Court the applicant denied the charges against him. He expressed astonishment that he was being prosecuted on account of the republication of his book, six months after it had first appeared, and submitted in particular that he could not be held responsible for either the terms used in the preface – signed “ Pélesor ” – or the quotations incorporated in the text [6]. For the rest, he contended that he had done no more than comment on the problems of the population of Kurdish origin on the basis of an account of actual events, which had, moreover, been discussed in the media and commented on by various politicians. He argued that the extracts quoted in the prosecution submissions had to be read in the context of the book as a whole; in that connection, he maintained that the use of a novelistic style meant that the book could not be seen as revealing an ideological or propagandist intention. It should be possible for everything in Turkey to be discussed and interpretation of history could not constitute an offence. In any event, it was not credible that a mere publication or the few quoted sentences could threaten the indivisibility of the State or influence readers’ minds to such a point that the unity of the Turkish nation would be impaired.', 'Mr Polat likewise denied that he had denounced civil servants with the aim of turning them into targets.', '13. On 23 December 1992 the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of disseminating separatist propaganda within the meaning of Law no. 3713.', 'In its judgment it considered separately the content of each of the six parts of the book alleged to be in breach of the law and in particular quoted substantial passages from the first two parts, including the following:', '“[First part]', 'In spring 1925 you were not even a seed. Your parents had no ‘ Hélin ’ [7]. Other parents had a Hélin, while your grandfather had himself witnessed the destruction of other Hélins. Without suspecting that one day his granddaughter might be given the name Hélin, how many times did he see other Hélins running away or falling in a heap at the bayonet’s point?', 'That is why, 55 years later, while you are living through the reality of Diyarbakır today, you must also learn the history of what your forefathers lived through in the spring of 1925. So when people tell you ‘The history of our people is one of tyranny and torture’ you will know what they are talking about. Is there not a saying which goes ‘He who is ignorant of the past cannot understand the present’? ...', 'On 13 February 1925 the village of Piran [8] was raided ... after a warrant had been issued for the arrest of ten Kurdish patriots. These patriots, preferring to fight rather than surrender to the gendarmes, shouldered their rifles and began a guerrilla campaign in the mountains. The events you are witnessing all these years later began with that clash. “On 13 February 1925 in the village of Piran ... ten of Sheikh Said’s men, who were wanted for ‘banditry’, refused to surrender to the gendarmes and fought back with weapons in hand; this sparked off an uprising. For three weeks the insurgents dominated the situation” [9]. This uprising, which had begun with ten people, turned into a serious, large-scale insurrection ... and spread throughout the region. Scarcely five years after the proclamation of the Republic through the Turkish national democratic revolution – which has remained uncompleted - ... it was impossible for the new administration, which had taken over from the Ottoman administration, to resolve the Kurdish problem as it had not been able to bring about the necessary democratic transformations... But at the time of the revolution the Kurds had been promised that their rights would be recognised and by that means had been dragged into the war against the imperialist occupation. Following the establishment of the Turkish National Assembly the Kurds waited two years for the promises made about the resolution of the Kurdish problem to be honoured. That period of silent waiting was brought to an end by the above-mentioned uprising led by SAİD-İ PALOYİ [10]. After the proclamation of the Republic, as the government had not satisfied the Kurds’ expectations ... the accumulated anger reached new heights and it was precisely this period of “angry” waiting which fuelled the insurrection. “By 7 March the forces of Sheikh Said had surrounded Diyarbakır. In the meantime they had dispersed several army regiments and captured the centre of Elazığ and the district of Palo” [11]. The insurrection, which was spreading, did not perhaps succeed in drawing in all Kurds on account of its clan-based organisation, but it did manage to mobilise a large part [of the population] of Diyarbakır.', 'When we look at Turkey as it was during the years of rebellion we see that the new State was not yet stable... There was an attempt to implement an expansionist policy which involved ignoring the rights of the Kurds and denying the existence of their territory, which the government wanted to annex...', 'There was no doubt that the insurrection of Said ‑ i Paloyi, begun in those circumstances, would be bloodily repressed by the fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This first event formed part of the reality of Diyarbakır; it lasted three months. The insurrection, which had found some support around Diyarbakır and in the villages and districts of Elazığ, had finally reached the centre of Diyarbakır ...', 'The old people still alive today who witnessed this event say that after the insurrection was put down about forty people were tried by Independence Courts Martial ( İstiklâl Mahkemeleri ) and executed. Mr Mazhar Müfit, the president of the court martial which convicted and ordered the execution of a number of eminent Kurds, including Said ‑ i Paloyi, spoke as follows after pronouncing sentence: ‘You have all pursued a specific objective, namely establishment of an independent Kurdistan, and in order to bring that about some of you abused one group of the population for your own shameful interests, while others among you allowed yourselves to be guided by your political ambitions and to be influenced by provocations which originated abroad.’ [12] ...', 'It was not on the manes of the horses of the fallen that the killers wiped their sabres clean. Those who climbed the scaffold kicked away the chairs under their feet themselves; the others were killed by cannonballs fired from the walls. When the streets of Amed [13] were awash with blood the walls were tinted ash-grey. That is how the townspeople came to wear the armband with the three black dots! [14] When you were not even a droplet of life, when we did not even know whether you would be born in a prison cell as a Kurdish girl, that is when the seed of the hatred [which was to explode] fifty-five years later was sown… [15]', '[Second part]', 'They forbade us to call you ‘ Hélin ’. They insisted that we call you ‘ Meral ’. On your birth certificate they ordered us to write ‘ Meral ’. Like the name of your country, your first name was proscribed…', 'It was at that time that the commando raids on the villages of the province of Diyarbakır began. Thousands of villagers were crushed under the soldiers’ rifle butts. The men of the villages were exhibited stark naked to their wives, daughters and daughters-in-law. During operations conducted under the pretext of searching for weapons, dozens of villagers were beaten to death. … The age-old hatred grew deeper. The official files contained reports about how the people of the region had rebelled against tyranny. Everything that had happened before was known about. Besides, isn’t there a saying ‘Crush the serpent’s head while it is still small’? However, the ‘serpent’ had grown and begun to bite. There had to be an explanation of the secret of this seedling, because the more it was cut back the more it budded. Battle was engaged between the ‘irreconcilable opposites…’ In 1925 the fighting, which had until then been rather clan-based, reached a higher level. Like those in the ‘opposite camp’, who had put their organisation in order, the revolutionary fighters on their side amalgamated the national struggle with the struggle between [social] classes. Breaking out from the regional and clan context, the Kurdish problem moved on towards a common front with class war. Socialism became the problem of the Kurds and the Kurdish question that of the socialists…” [16]', 'The National Security Court, after rehearsing the historical facts that had led to the events referred to by Mr Polat, ruled that he had given an inexact version of them. It emphasised that the Turkish State was a single entity, that its territory formed a whole and that all its nationals, without exception, were “patriots”. It went on to say that it was unacceptable to describe as patriots insurgents who had caused the death of thousands of troops; it was not true that within Turkey there was a “Kurdish territory” or a “Turkish territory”; it flew in the face of the facts to give the name “ Kurdistan ” to a region where citizens of various origins lived; and that by going so far as to say that the State of the Republic of Turkey was expansionist and colonialist Mr Polat had supported the assertion that there were two nations – the Kurdish nation, whose history had allegedly been marked by tyranny and torture, and the Turks, who were enslavers. In the court’s view such assertions were unacceptable because they encouraged separatism and the dismemberment of the nation.', 'On the subject of the second part of the book, the court observed: “Even the opening phrase – ‘Like the name of your country, your first name was proscribed’ – suggested separatism.” It ruled that by discussing the prohibition of the forename “ Hélin ” the author had intended to allude to the ban on the name “ Kurdistan ”. Mr Polat had tried to conceal in that way his real intention, which had been to assert the existence of a separate country within the territory of the Turkish State.', 'The court said that during the periods when democracy had been suspended and the army was in power there had been restrictions on certain rights and freedoms and undesirable incidents – such as gathering villagers together with a view to collecting hidden weapons – had taken place. While it was conceivable that from time to time it had been necessary to use force against people who refused to hand over their weapons, it was unacceptable for Mr Polat to present such incidents as acts of torture which had exclusively affected the peasants of Diyarbakır, thus insinuating that one group of Turkish citizens were victims of discriminatory treatment. In fact, it was Mr Polat’s very approach which constituted discrimination based on region of origin and ethnic considerations.', 'As for the other parts of the book, the National Security Court held:', '“[In the third part] ... the allegations – which the author attempts to back up by giving the names of prison staff – that ... repression has become the destiny of the Kurdish people and that people of Kurdish origin have been imprisoned and tortured to death on account of their struggle for independence ... are not credible and merely take advantage of people’s feelings... Remarks like those to the effect that the consciousness of nationhood has been strengthened by the inhuman treatment of the Kurdish people and that the national struggle is a noble one ... amount to nothing more than separatist propaganda...', '[In the fourth part] it is stated that in the prisons female prisoners ... were woken up in the middle of the night and falsely told that there was a fire, but that their fear suddenly transformed itself into a marriage ceremony and they then began to shout out cries of joy ( tilili ). The memory of persons who had committed suicide on the evening of 18 May is evoked in such a way as to exploit people’s feelings. In describing as heroic certain acts inspired by a primitive oriental mentality, in choosing to see a simple cry as a marriage ceremony and in presenting suicides as heroic acts the intention can only be to bolster [Kurdish] nationalist sentiment... It is obvious that conditions in prison are not ideal ... however, by using demagogic language the defendant misrepresented those conditions to a considerable extent, as if they were being used to repress the sacred and noble rebellion of the Kurdish people subjected to tyranny and torture. Such assertions amount to separatist propaganda...', '[In the fifth part] the defendant ... discusses certain traditions and customs to which Turks and Kurds attach importance or a symbolic value... He relates, among others, the following anecdote: ‘According to legend, during Dersim’s rebellion government soldiers burned a village. While the village was on fire a child of eight to ten years of age who had escaped from the flames ran up and threw himself into the arms of the soldiers standing round the fire. When he suddenly caught sight of the earth-coloured uniforms, ... the child preferred to throw himself into the flames than to stay where he was, so he ran back to where he had come from and jumped into the fire. The Kurds have never throughout history been able to establish a lasting State and their quest for freedom has transformed itself in their hearts into glowing embers. That is why the fire of Newroz is in fact the fire of their desire for freedom...’ [17] Kurdish society is based on a population which has existed for thousands of years. In the course of history it remained under the influence of a number of religions, languages and cultures. Every society goes through certain phases and when it moves from one to another some of its customs and traditions live on... That is perfectly natural. However, ... the defendant likens the fires lit in the mountains during the Newroz celebrations to the fire of freedom in people’s hearts... Whereas, in Turkish society too there are events at which fires are lit... That does not mean that the Turkish people or the Kurdish people intoxicate themselves with the fire of freedom. To claim that the Kurds are not free is to attribute to them a demand ... for freedom. But what would follow freedom for the Kurds is division of the territory and the nation. It is precisely that outcome which the author implicitly advocates and seeks. ... As for the legend related by the defendant ..., it constitutes clear and conclusive proof of hostility towards the Turks...', '[In the sixth part] the defendant speaks of prisons and the resistance movements inside them. We will not examine each of these movements: a full account of them has already been given in the bulletins and statements put out by the PKK! ... Among the ... prisoners there are also members of the PKK’s central committee and other leading members. We know that when the prosecutors of the Military Legal Service drew up the indictments calling for ... application of the death penalty a movement of panic sprang up, and that to calm the situation down the PKK militants, in order to arouse so-called resistance movements, used people they had conditioned by saying to them: ‘Behold the fascist Turkish Republic which oppresses you; you are treated like soldiers, they wake you up at the same time as them, they make you take part in sport and they force you to go to sleep at fixed times’. Moreover, with regard to M.D. - who, according to the defendant, committed suicide – even his friends in prison confirmed that he had killed himself after a period of depression. Furthermore, did not one Ş.R.G. decide to commit suicide in Diyarbakır Prison when suffering from depression? He dressed himself in thick clothes, stuffed them with cotton soaked in eau-de-Cologne and then set fire to them with a match. When his clothes began to burn his skin he started to shout out and call to the other prisoners for help... When they had saved him he told those around him how much he regretted what he had done and that he realised how stupid he had been. In fact, suicides in prisons are committed ... as a result of depression originating in a ... feeling of guilt about offences committed. ... Misrepresenting all these facts, the defendant portrays PKK members as innocent freedom fighters and their resistance as legitimate and just, thus making manifest his criminal intent.”', 'In short, according to the National Security Court, it was “clearly and incontestably established” that Mr Polat had disseminated propaganda against the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey and the indivisible unity of the nation, which justified sentencing him, pursuant to section 8(1) of Law no. 3713, to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 50 million Turkish liras (TRL). It held, however, that although the facts of the case also constituted an offence under section 6(1) of Law no. 3713, it was not necessary, regard being had to Article 79 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below), to pronounce sentence separately in respect of that offence.', 'In adition, the National Security Court ordered the confiscation of all the editions of the book.', '14. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. In his statement of the grounds of appeal he submitted that his intention had never been to work towards separatist ends but to set out his thoughts – in a critical spirit - about real events relating to the Kurdish question. He contended that the possibility of conducting such an exercise was an indispensable precondition for democracy and freedom of thought.', 'He further asserted that the judges at first instance had wrongly based their judgment on their own interpretation of historical events or their own perception of what was allegedly implicit. He argued that the National Security Court had been inconsistent in accepting on the one hand that there was such a thing as “Kurdish society” while denying on the other the possibility that this society might have its own patriotic feelings, epics, legends and demands for freedom. In any event, such questions were matters for sociologists or historians not judges. The National Security Court’s approach had therefore been more political than legal and was bound to have led to an unfair judgment.', '15. After a hearing, the Court of Cassation dismissed Mr Polat’s appeal by a judgment of 27 May 1993, holding that the assessment of the evidence by the first-instance court had been consistent with the reasons it had given for rejecting the applicant’s defence.', '16. In July 1993 Mr Polat was imprisoned. On his release in January 1995 he paid the fine of TRL 50,000,000 that had been imposed on him.', '17. On 30 October 1995 Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 came into force. This reduced the terms of imprisonment prescribed by section 8 of Law no. 3713, but increased the fines it laid down (see paragraph 19 below).', 'In a temporary provision relating to section 2, Law no. 4126 also made provision for automatic re-examination of sentences pronounced in judgments rendered pursuant to section 8 of Law no. 3713 (see paragraph 20 below). In accordance with that provision, the National Security Court re-examined the merits of the applicant’s case. By a judgment of 14 December 1995 – the text of which reproduced to a considerable extent the wording of the judgment of 23 December 1992 (see paragraph 13 above) – it finally sentenced Mr Polat to pay an additional fine of TRL 50,000,000 and confirmed the order for the confiscation of his book.', 'On appeal by the applicant, the Court of Cassation upheld that decision by a judgment of 6 May 1997.', 'On 3 August 1998 Mr Polat, complying with an order to pay that had been served on him, paid the additional fine.']","['II. relevant domestic law and practice', 'A.

Criminal case-law submitted by the Government', '23. The Government supplied copies of six decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code) and of five others withdrawing charges against persons suspected of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no.3713)). In three of these cases where the offences had been committed by means of publications, the prosecutor based his decision on the fact that there was no evidence of some of the constituent elements of the offence.', 'Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the judgments of 19 November (no. 1996/428) and 27 December 1996 (no. 1996/519); 6 March (no. 1997/33), 3 June (no. 1997/102), 17 October (no. 1997/527), 24 October (no. 1997/541) and 23 December 1997 (no. 1997/606); and 21 January (no. 1998/8), 3 February (no. 1998/14), 19 March (no. 1998/56), 21 April (no. 1998/ 87) and 17 June 1998 (no. 1998/133). In the judgments against the authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts reached their decisions on account of the absence of “propaganda”, a constituent element of the offence.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '24. Mr Polat applied to the Commission on 18 November 1993. He alleged that his conviction on account of the publication of his book constituted a violation of Article 9 of the Convention. In addition, he complained that confiscation of the copies of the book breached Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.', '25. On 24 June 1996 the Commission declared the application (no. 23500/94) admissible. In its report of 11 December 1997 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion by thirty-one votes to one that there had been a violation of Article 10 – examined together with Article 9 – and that no separate issue arose under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (unanimously). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the partly dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [18].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '26. In his memorial the applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been violations of Articles 10 and 6 § 1 of the Convention and complained, in substance, of a violation of Article 7. He also requested the Court to award him just satisfaction under Article 41 and to order the respondent State to declare his conviction null and void and return the confiscated books to him.', '27. In their memorial the Government asked the Court to dismiss Mr Polat’s application. In support of their arguments they also submitted extracts from daily newspapers published during 1991 containing reports on various events that had occurred in south-east Turkey and information about the social and political impact of those incidents inside Turkey.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. SCOPE OF THE CASE', '28. Before the Court the applicant alleged, inter alia, violations of Article 6 § 1 and, in substance, Article 7 of the Convention. The Court notes, however, that as Mr Polat did not raise these complaints at the stage when the Commission was examining the admissibility of the application (see paragraph 24 above) it cannot entertain them (see, mutatis mutandis, the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 277, § 63).', 'II. ALLEGED violation of Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention', '29. In his application Mr Polat submitted that his conviction pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) had breached Article 9 of the Convention. At the hearing before the Court, however, he did not object to the suggestion that the Court should consider this complaint, as the Commission had done (see paragraph 25 above), from the standpoint of Article 10 of the Convention alone. The Court observes in that connection that since it is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case, it does not consider itself bound by the characterisation given by applicants, governments or the Commission (see the Guerra and Others v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ I, p. 223, § 44).', 'Article 10 of the Convention provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', 'A. The Government’s preliminary objection', '30. As they had done before the Commission, the Government raised a preliminary objection in two limbs on the ground of failure to exhaust domestic remedies. They asserted that the applicant had not tried to exercise any remedy against the decision by the Ankara Court of First Instance to order the seizure of the book as an interim measure (see paragraph 10 above). Secondly, Mr Polat had not at any stage of the proceedings before the Turkish courts relied on the Convention provisions he was now invoking in Strasbourg.', '31. Like the applicant and the Commission, the Court notes, with regard to the first limb of the objection, that an appeal against the interim seizure ordered by the Ankara Court of First Instance would not have had any effect on the events which formed the interference complained of by the applicant, namely his conviction by the Ankara State Security Court and confiscation of his book. Consequently, such an appeal cannot be regarded as “adequate” and “effective” (see, mutatis mutandis, the Gautrin and Others v. France judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1023, § 38).', 'With regard to the complaints raised by the applicant before the Turkish courts, the Court reiterates that the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies is satisfied where an applicant has raised before the national authorities, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law, the complaints he intends to make subsequently in Strasbourg (see the Fressoz and Roire v. France judgment of 21 January 1999, p. .., § 37). Like the Commission, the Court notes that before the National Security Court and the Court of Cassation the applicant clearly complained of a restriction of his freedom of expression (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).', 'The Government’s preliminary objection must therefore be dismissed.', 'B. The merits of the complaint', '32. Those appearing before the Court agreed that the applicant’s conviction amounted to an interference with the exercise of his freedom of expression. Such interference breaches Article 10 unless it satisfies the requirements of the second paragraph of Article 10. The Court must therefore determine whether it was “prescribed by law”, was directed towards one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve the aims concerned.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '33. The applicant submitted that application of section 8 of Law no. 3713, which had formed the basis for his conviction, gave rise to different results for different defendants, because its interpretation varied from one person to another and from one judge to another, which made its effects unforeseeable.', '34. The Government submitted that by amending the relevant wording of section 8 Law no. 4126 had clarified the constituent elements of the offence contemplated in the provision concerned, which had thus been made sufficiently explicit, and the applicant had benefited from the amendment because his case was re-examined following the entry into force of Law no. 4126 (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above).', '35. At the hearing before the Court, the Delegate of the Commission submitted that the wording of section 8 was rather vague and that it might be questioned whether it satisfied the requirements of clarity and foreseeability inherent in the term “law”. Noting, however, that the Commission had taken the view that section 8 provided a sufficient legal basis for the applicant’s conviction, he concluded that the interference was “prescribed by law”.', '36. The Court takes note of the Delegate’s concern about the vague wording of section 8 of Law no. 3713. However, like the Commission, it finds that since the applicant’s conviction was based on section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) the resulting interference with his right to freedom of expression may be regarded as “prescribed by law”.', '2. Legitimate aim', '37. The applicant did not express an opinion on this point.', '38. The Government submitted that the aim of the interference in issue had been not only to maintain “national security” and prevent “[public] disorder”, as the Commission had found, but also to preserve “territorial integrity” and “national unity”.', '39. The Court considers that, having regard to the sensitivity of the security situation in south-east Turkey (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2539, § 10) and to the need for the authorities to be alert to acts capable of fuelling additional violence, the measures taken against the applicant can be said to have been in furtherance of certain of the aims mentioned by the Government, namely the protection of national security and territorial integrity and the prevention of disorder and crime. This is certainly true where, as with the situation in south-east Turkey at the time of the circumstances of this case, the separatist movement had recourse to methods which rely on the use of violence.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '( i ) The applicant', '40. The applicant submitted that freedom of expression was incompatible with imposition by a country’s courts of a certain way of interpreting history, but that one of the main reasons why he had been convicted was that his book did not reflect the official reading of history.', 'Secondly, there was nothing separatist about the mere fact that he had spoken of Kurdistan in the book. In a number of countries in various parts of the world regions were named after the population who lived there, while remaining an integral part of the national territory.', 'Nor was it separatism to criticise the torture and tyranny endemic in Turkish prisons, particularly Diyarbakır Prison. By punishing the authors of such criticism the Turkish courts were in reality trying to conceal the facts revealed therein.', 'In short, the mere fact of referring to the existence of the Kurdish people in Turkey, defending their language and culture and reporting the torture and tyranny they had to endure amounted in the eyes of the authorities to separatism. In Turkey asserting that PKK militants had been executed after their arrest was tantamount to “encouraging PKK terror”, while opposition to the “dirty war” was a crime which meant “support for the PKK”.', '(ii) The Government', '41. The Government emphasised in the first place that the Turkish authorities were better placed than the Court to assess the necessity of interference with exercise by Turkish citizens of their freedom of expression. They alone had a detailed knowledge of the facts. In the present case, the 1925 revolt eulogised in the book had been at the origin of the separatist and terrorist movement which had remained a threat until the present day and had already cost the lives of thousands of people. By describing separatists as “heroes” and “Kurdish patriots”, for example, the author had kept that threat alive. In its judgment the Court should be guided by, among other decisions, the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997 ( Reports 1997-VII, at p. 2533) and the decision given by the Commission on 12 October 1978 in the Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom case (application no. 7050/75, DR 19, pp. 5 et seq.).', 'Article 10 left Contracting States a particularly broad margin of appreciation in cases where their territorial integrity was threatened by terrorism. What is more, when confronted with the situation in Turkey – where the PKK systematically carried out massacres of women, children, schoolteachers and conscripts – the Turkish authorities had a duty to prohibit all separatist propaganda, which could only incite violence and hostility between society’s various component groups and thus endanger human rights and democracy.', '(iii) The Commission', '42. The Commission adverted to the “duties and responsibilities” mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 10, which made it important for people expressing an opinion in public on sensitive political issues to ensure that they did not condone “unlawful political violence”. Freedom of expression nevertheless included the right to engage in open discussion of difficult problems like those with which Turkey was confronted with a view to analysing, for example, the underlying causes of the situation or to expressing opinions on possible solutions.', 'The Commission noted that the applicant’s book contained quotations from texts criticising the development of Ottoman “colonialism and “feudalism” and attempted to give a historical explanation for the resurgence of violence in recent years, particularly in the Diyarbakır region. The applicant had expressed his views on the Kurdish question in relatively moderate terms and had not endorsed the use of violence as part of the Kurdish separatist struggle. The applicant’s conviction therefore constituted a form of censorship which was incompatible with the requirements of Article 10.', '(b) The Court’s assessment', '43. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles underlying its judgments relating to Article 10, as set out in, for example, its Zana v. Turkey judgment (previously cited, p. 2547-48, § 51), and its Fressoz and Roire v. France judgment (previously cited, p. .., § 45).', '( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '44. The book in issue comments on certain episodes in Turkish history in the light of the uprising started in 1925, in the village of Piran, by Sheikh Said and his men. It also describes and comments on certain facts relating to the life of prisoners in Diyarbakır Prison and the ill-treatment allegedly meted out to them. The author criticises the bloody repression of the uprising and states his opinion that this was an expression by the “fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie” of its “disregard for the rights of the Kurds” and its “denial of the existence of their territory”.', 'The Ankara National Security Court criticised the applicant for presenting an inexact version of the events related and thus implicitly supporting Kurdish nationalism, separatism and the dismemberment of the nation (see paragraph 13 above).', 'It is obvious that this was not a “neutral” description of historical facts and that through his book the applicant intended to criticise the action of the Turkish authorities in the south-east of the country and to encourage the population concerned to oppose it.', '45. The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest (see the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1957, § 58). Furthermore, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen, or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless, it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1567, § 54). Finally, where such remarks incite to violence against an individual or a public official or a sector of the population, the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression.', '46. The Court further reiterates that it will take into account the background to the cases submitted to it, particularly problems linked to the prevention of terrorism (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1568, § 58). On that point, it takes note of the Turkish authorities’ concern about the dissemination of views which they consider might exacerbate the serious disturbances that have been going on in Turkey for some fifteen years (see paragraph 39 above).', '47. The Court observes, however, that the applicant is a private individual and that he made his views public by means of a literary work rather than through the mass media, a fact which limited their potential impact on “national security”, public “order” and “territorial integrity” to a substantial degree. The Court notes in addition that, although certain passages in the book criticise the attitude of the Turkish authorities and give the narrative a hostile tone, they do not constitute an incitement to violence, armed resistance or an uprising; in the Court’s view this is a factor which it is essential to take into consideration, especially as the events related happened at a period which is already relatively distant in time.', '48. Furthermore, the Court is struck by the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant – particularly the fact that he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment – and the persistence of the proceedings against him. It observes that after he had served his prison sentence the applicant was ordered to pay an additional fine following the entry into force of Law no. 4126 (see paragraph 20 above).', 'The Court notes in that connection that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing whether the interference was proportionate to the aims it pursued.', '49. In conclusion, Mr Polat’s conviction was disproportionate to the aims pursued and accordingly not “necessary in a democratic society”. There has therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.', 'III. alleged violation of Article 1 of PROTOCOL NO. 1', '50. In his application to the Commission Mr Polat also alleged a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, he did not maintain this complaint during the proceedings before the Court, which sees no reason to examine it of its own motion (see, mutatis mutandis, the Incal judgment cited above, p. 1574, § 75).', 'application of Article 41 of the Convention', '51. The applicant claimed just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, which provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'Pecuniary damage', '52. For pecuniary damage the applicant claimed 10,489 American dollars (USD), broken down as follows: USD 1,415 for the two fines (two times TRL 50,000,000, converted at the rate applicable on the date of payment), USD 1,478 (that is TRL 60,000,000) for loss of earnings during his imprisonment, USD 6,336 for losses sustained on account of the confiscation of the book (publication costs and loss of profits) and USD 1,260 for loss of profits due to the impossibility of republishing the book.', '53. The Government asserted that Mr Polat had not supplied any documentary evidence of the loss of profits he had alleged.', '54. The Delegate of the Commission did not express an opinion on the question.', '55. The Court finds that the fines imposed on the applicant were a direct consequence of the violation of Article 10 it has found. On the other hand, the Court considers that a causal connection between the violation and the other heads of pecuniary damage alleged by the applicant has not been sufficiently established. In particular, the Court is not in possession of any reliable information about the amount of the profits allegedly lost by Mr Polat.', 'Consequently, the Court awards the applicant USD 1,415 for pecuniary damage.', 'Non-pecuniary damage', '56. Mr Polat sought payment of USD 18,940 (TRL 5,000,000,000) for non-pecuniary damage.', '57. The Government asked the Court to hold that a finding that there had been a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction.', '58. The Delegate of the Commission did not express an opinion on the question.', '59. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him compensation in the sum of FRF 40,000 under that head.', 'Costs and expenses', '60. The applicant claimed USD 2,261 (TRL 24,000,000) for his costs and expenses, supplying various documents in support of his claims.', '61. The Government found these sums excessive. They submitted in particular that the documentary evidence supplied by the applicant did not accurately reflect his claims and that the fees requested exceeded the rates normally applied in Turkey in similar cases.', '62. On the basis of the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant FRF 20,000, less the FRF 10,446.45 paid by the Council of Europe in legal aid.', 'Default interest', '63. The Court deems it appropriate to make provision for the payment of default interest at the rate of 5% per annum for the sum awarded in American dollars and 3.47% per annum for the sums awarded in French francs.', 'Other claims', '64. The applicant also requested the Court to order the respondent State to declare his conviction null and void and return the confiscated books to him.', '65. Neither the Government nor the Delegate of the Commission expressed an opinion on this point.', '66. The Court notes that the Convention does not empower it to accede to such a request. It reiterates that it is for the State to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal system in order to comply with the provisions of the Convention or to redress the situation that has given rise to a violation (see, mutatis mutandis, the Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 24, § 81).']",2,tr,001-58273,1

The applicant', '8. The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.', '9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul.', 'B. The impugned news report', '10. The issue dated 26 April 1992 contained a news report providing information given at a press conference by a delegation - which included two former Turkish parliamentarians Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan, Lord Avebury and a member of the Anglican Church - on its visit to Şırnak village, in the wake of tensions in the area.', 'The news report included an article reporting the Governor of Şırnak as having told the delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people.', 'It further rendered a dialogue between Leyla Zana, Orhan Doğan and İsmet Yediyıldız, a Gendarme Commander.', 'The relevant part of the report read:', '“Gendarmerie Regiment Commander İsmet Yediyıldız :', '‘Your blood would not quench my thirst…’', 'While the British delegation and Diyarbakır MP Leyla Zana, Şırnak MP Orhan Doğan and Bismil District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu managed to persuade the people of Tepe village, which was blockaded by the security forces, after talking to them for a while and telling them that permission had been obtained for them to get the bodies of their dead, an interesting conversation took place between Diyarbakır Security Director Ramazan Er and Gendarmerie Regiment Commander İsmet Yediyıldız.', 'The conversation between the MPs Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan on the one hand and Colonel İsmet Yediyıldız on the other hand was recounted by Leyla Zana as follows:', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : What business do you have here? There had been nobody here until you arrived. You have come and stirred things up again.', 'Leyla Zana : No, Sir. The situation had been extremely tense before we arrived. We have come with the District Governor and are trying to calm down the tension here. Here is the District Governor.', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : No, that’s not true. We saw when we were flying by helicopter that there was nobody here before. People gathered when you arrived.', 'Orhan Doğan : No, you can ask the District Governor if you like. (Meanwhile, District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu was also being told off.)', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : Do you know who these dead people are?', 'Orhan Doğan : Yes, they are our children, the children of all of us.', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : No, these are not our children, they are your children.', 'Orhan Doğan : But my Colonel ...', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : Do not call me your colonel. I am not your colonel. Your blood would not quench my thirst. You should also be honest and freely admit that my blood would not quench your thirst. Right now I could kill you like a rat. Your death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst.', 'Leyla Zana : If the problem can be solved by killing us, then here are our people; let’s go among them and you kill us and this problem is solved.', 'Colonel Yediyıldız : No, I would not kill you now. I would kill you after disgracing you in the eyes of the people.”', 'C. The charges against the applicant', '11. On 29 May 1992 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court ( İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi ) charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with revealing the identity of officials mandated to fight terrorism and thus rendering them terrorist targets. The charges were brought under section 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (""the 1991 Act""; see paragraph 16 below).', '12. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court the applicant denied the charges and advanced the following arguments in his defence. The news report had been published with the aim of informing the public of the events which had occurred during the 1992 Newroz celebrations. It had been based on a joint press declaration by former deputies Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan and an English delegation, during their visit to south-east Turkey. By virtue of the fact that section 6 of the 1991 Act contained an absolute prohibition on the disclosure and dissemination of the identity of officials appointed to fight terrorism, it enabled officials to abuse their authority, violate the law and subject citizens to ill-treatment. The right to receive and impart information, including information concerning acts of officials, was fundamental in a democratic society. Section 6 of the 1991 Act contravened not only the Turkish Constitution but also Article 10 of the Convention.', 'D. The applicant’s conviction', '13. In a judgment of 2 September 1993 the National Security Court convicted the applicant under section 6 of the 1991 Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of 54,000,000 Turkish lira. It noted that the news report had contained an allegation to the effect that the Governor of Şırnak had stated to the visiting delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It had further affirmed that a gendarme commander had stated to Orhan Doğan in Leyla Zana’s presence ""[y]our death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst"". By having disclosed the identity of these officials, the publication had rendered them targets for terrorist attack.', 'E. The applicant’s appeal against conviction and subsequent proceedings', '14. The applicant appealed, reiterating his defence before the National Security Court. He also argued that the press declaration at issue had already been reported in other newspapers and magazines and that the incriminated news report had added nothing to these.', ""15. On 10 December 1993 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It upheld the cogency of the National Security Court's assessment of the evidence and its reasoning for rejecting the applicant's defence.""]","['II. relevant domestic law', 'A. The criminal law', 'The Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991) [1]', '16. The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows:', 'Section 6', '“It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged, provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target.', 'It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations.', '…', 'Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. [2] However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.”', 'B. The National Security Courts', '17. The relevant provisions of domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Court are quoted in paragraphs 32 ‑ 33 of the Sürek no. 1 v. Turkey judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '18. Mr Kamil Tekin Sürek applied to the Commission on 9 March 1994. He complained that his conviction and sentence constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention and that his case had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He also maintained that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time, which gave rise to a separate violation of Article 6 § 1.', '19. The Commission declared the application (no. 24122/94) admissible on 2 September 1996, with the exception of the applicant’s Article 6 § 1 complaint relating to the length of the criminal proceedings in his case. In its report of 13 January 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (23 votes to 9) and that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (31votes to 1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [1].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '20. The applicant requested the Court to find the respondent State in breach of its obligations under Articles 6 § 1 and 10 of the Convention and to award him just satisfaction under Article 41.', 'The Government for their part invited the Court to reject the applicant’s complaints.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 oF THE CONVENTION', '21. The applicant alleged that the authorities had unjustifiably interfered with his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '22. The Government maintained that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was justified under the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 10. The Commission agreed with the Government on this point.', 'A. Existence of an interference', '23. The Court notes that it is clear, and this has not been disputed, that there has been an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression on account of his conviction and sentence under section 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter “the 1991 Act”).', 'B. Justification of the interference', '24. The interference contravened Article 10 unless it was “prescribed by law”, had one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such aim or aims. The Court will examine each of these criteria in turn.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '25. It was not disputed that the interference had a legal basis in section 6 of the 1991 Act and was thus ""prescribed by law"" within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. The Court does not see any reason for arriving at a contrary conclusion.', '2. Legitimate aim', '26. The applicant did not dispute that the interference pursued a legitimate aim under the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention.', '27. The Government submitted that the measures had been imposed in the interests of national security and territorial integrity.', '28. The Commission was of the opinion that the applicant’s conviction and sentence for the disclosure of the identities of certain officials pursued the legitimate aim of protection of the rights of others. The Commission left it open whether other aims, such as the protection of national security and public safety, were relevant.', '29. The Court, having regard to the sensitivity of the security situation in south-east Turkey (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2547, §§ 19 and 50) and to the need for the authorities to take particular steps to protect public officials involved in the fight against terrorism from being targeted for terrorist attack, considers that the contested measures can be said to have been taken in the interest of national security and territorial integrity and for the protection of the rights of others, which are legitimate aims under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '( i ) The applicant', '30. The applicant complained that although he was the owner of the review with no editorial responsibility for its content, he had nonetheless been punished under section 6 of the 1991 Act for the disclosure of the names of the public officials in question. He submitted that the impugned data had formed part of an objective news report aimed at providing the public with information given at a press conference by a delegation of public figures, in the wake of certain tensions at Şırnak in 1992. The publication did not praise the PKK. Nor did the review or the applicant himself have any links with that organisation. Finally, he stressed that the press declaration at issue had already been reported in other newspapers and that the incriminated news report added nothing to these reports.', '(ii) The Government', '31. The Government maintained that the news report published by the applicant had contained unfounded accusations which, by virtue of the disclosure of the identity of certain officials involved in the fight against terrorism, had put their lives at danger from terrorist attack.', ""As the owner of the review the applicant had participated in the dissemination of separatist propaganda by publishing a news report which, by attempting in a veiled but nonetheless obvious manner to vindicate a terrorist organisation, threatened fundamental interests of the national community such as territorial integrity, national unity and security and the prevention of crime and disorder. In the Government's submission, separatist propaganda inevitably incites to violence and provokes hostility among the various groups in Turkish society, thus endangering human rights and democracy."", 'In the Government’s view the measures taken against the applicant did were within the authorities’ margin of appreciation in relation to the type of activity which endangers the vital interests of the State and the taking of these measures in the instant case found its justification under paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '(iii) The Commission', ""32. The Commission observed that, bearing in mind the general tension and the level of terrorism and violence occurring in south-east Turkey, the officials engaged in State action against terrorist groups in that area were frequently exposed to serious risks and therefore a high degree of protection was required. According to the findings of the National Security Court, the disclosure of the identities of the officials concerned had made them possible targets of terrorist attack. In the Commission's opinion, the incriminated news report, which in itself might have contained information of public interest, could well have been published without disclosure of the identities of the two officials concerned. It concluded that there had been no violation of Article 10 in the circumstances of the case."", '(b) The Court’s assessment', '33. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles underlying its judgments relating to Article 10, as set out in, for example, its Zana v. Turkey judgment (cited above, pp. 2547-48, § 51) and in its Fressoz and Roire v. France judgment of 21 January 1999 ( Reports 1999-, p. …, § 45).', '( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '34. The Court further recalls that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest (see the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996 Reports 1996-V, p. 1957, § 58). The dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless, it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1567, § 54). Finally, where such remarks incite to violence against an individual or a public official or a sector of the population, the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression.', '35. Since the applicant was convicted of disclosing the identity of certain public officials through the medium of the review of which he was the owner, the impugned interference must also be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of a political democracy (see among many other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A, no. 103, p. 26, § 41; and the above ‑ mentioned Fressoz and Roire judgment, p…., § 45). While the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for the protection of vital interests of the State such as national security or territorial integrity against the threat of violence or the prevention of disorder or crime, it is nevertheless incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues, including divisive ones. Not only has the press the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public has a right to receive them. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders (see the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, p. 26 §§ 41-42).', '36. The Court notes that the applicant’s conviction and sentence had been imposed on the ground that his review had published a news report identifying certain officials with certain statements suggesting misconduct on their part. While it is true that the applicant did not personally associate himself with the information contained in the news report, the Court does not accept his argument that he should be exonerated from any criminal liability for their contents on account of the fact that he only had a commercial and not an editorial relationship with the review. He was an owner and as such had the power to shape the editorial direction of the review. For that reason, he was vicariously subject to the “duties and responsibilities” which the review’s editorial and journalist staff undertake in the collection and dissemination of information to the public and which assume an even greater importance in situations of conflict and tension.', '37. The applicant\'s conviction and sentence related, in the first place, to the fact that his publication had reported the Governor of Şırnak to have affirmed that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given order to open fire against the people. Secondly, it had quoted Leyla Zana, a former parliamentarian, as having stated that a named Gendarme Commander had told Orhan Doğan, also a former parliamentarian, that ""[y]our death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst"" (see paragraph 10 above).', 'Thus, the wording of the statements clearly implied serious misconduct on the part of the police and gendarme officers in question. Although the statements were not presented in a manner which could be regarded as incitement to violence against the officers concerned or the authorities, they were capable of exposing the officers to strong public contempt. Moreover, the news report was published in the context of the security situation in south-east Turkey, where since approximately 1985 serious disturbances have raged between the security forces and the members of the PKK involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the region (see the above-mentioned Zana judgment, p. 2539, § 10).', ""38. In the light of the foregoing, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant's conviction and sentence were supported by reasons which were relevant for the purposes of the necessity test under paragraph 2 of Article 10."", '39. As regards the further question whether the reasons relied on could also be considered sufficient, the Court observes that the contested interference related to journalistic reporting of statements made by certain politicians to the press concerning their visit to an area of Turkey where tensions had occurred (see the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31). The impugned news report simply reiterated what a police officer and a gendarme officer were said to have ordered or affirmed on specific occasions. Assuming that the assertions were true, the Court considers that, in view of the seriousness of the misconduct in question, the public had a legitimate interest in knowing not only the nature of the conduct but also the identity of the officers. However, the defences of truth (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 24, §§ 47-48) and public interest could not have been pleaded under the relevant Turkish law.', '40. Furthermore, it is undisputed that the press declaration on which the news report was based had already been reported in other newspapers and that the incriminated news coverage added nothing to those reports. Nor has it been submitted that other newspapers were prosecuted in respect of publication of information derived from the said declaration (see the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 23, § 51). At the time of the publication of the news report in the present case, the information in issue, identifying specific police and gendarme officers with serious misconduct, was already in the public domain. Thus, the interest in protecting the identity of the officers concerned had been substantially diminished and the potential damage which the restriction was aimed at preventing had already been done (see the Observer and Guardian and the Sunday Times (no. 2) judgments of 26 November 1991, respectively Series A no. 216, pp. 34-35, §§ 69-71; and Series A no. 217, pp. 30-31, §§ 54-56).', '41. Finally, the Court considers that the conviction and sentence were capable of discouraging the contribution of the press to open discussion on matters of public concern.', ""42. In the light of the above, the Court does not find that the objective of the Government in protecting the officers in question against terrorist attack was sufficient to justify the restrictions placed on the applicant's right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. In the absence of a fair balance between the interests in protecting the freedom of the press and those in protecting the identity of the public officials in question, the interference complained of was disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. There has therefore been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case."", 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION', ""A. The Government's preliminary objection"", '43. In their memorial to the Court the Government maintained that the applicant, not having raised before the domestic courts his complaint that his case had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal, had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 of the Convention.', '44. The Court reiterates that it takes cognisance of preliminary objections in so far as the State in question has already raised them, at least in substance and with sufficient clarity, before the Commission, in principle at the stage of the initial examination of admissibility (see, for instance, the Aytekin v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p. § 77). However, it does not appear from the observations submitted by the Government to the Commission that they objected, on the ground of non-exhaustion, to the admissibility of the above ‑ mentioned complaint. Accordingly, they are estopped from raising their preliminary objection.', ""B. The merits of the applicant's complaint"", '45. The applicant complained that he had been denied a fair hearing in breach of the Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the National Security Court which tried and convicted him. In so far as is relevant Article 6 § 1 provides:', '“In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...”', '46. The Government contested this allegation whereas the Commission accepted it.', '47. In the applicant’s submission the military judges appointed to the National Security Courts such as the Istanbul National Security Court were dependent on the executive, being appointed by the joint decree of the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister subject to the approval of the President of the Republic. He pointed to the fact that their professional assessment and promotion as well as their security of tenure were within the control of the executive branch and in turn the army. The ties which bound them to the executive and to the army made it impossible for military judges to discharge their functions on the bench in an independent and impartial manner. The applicant further stressed that the independence and impartiality of military judges and hence of the courts on which they sat were compromised since these judges were unable to take a position which might be contradictory to the views of their commanding officers.', 'The applicant stated that these considerations impaired the independence and impartiality of the Istanbul National Security Court and prevented him from receiving a fair trial, in violation of Article 6 § 1.', '48. The Government replied that the rules governing the appointment of military judges to the National Security Courts and the guarantees which they enjoy in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements ofindependence and impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The Government disputed the applicant’s argument that military judges were accountable to their superior officers. In the first place, it was an offence under section 112 of the Military Code for a public official to attempt to influence the performance by a military judge of his judicial functions (see paragraph 17 above). Secondly, the assessment reports referred to by the applicant related only to conduct of a military judge’s non-judicial duties. Military judges had access to their assessment reports and were able to challenge their content before the Military Supreme Administrative Court ( ibidem ). When acting in a judicial capacity a military judge was assessed in exactly the same manner as a civilian judge.', ""49. The Government further averred that the fairness of the applicant’s trial had not been prejudiced by reason of the presence of a military judge on the bench. They claimed that neither the military judge’s hierarchical authorities nor the public authorities which had appointed him to the court had any interest in the proceedings or in the outcome of the case. The Istanbul National Security Court's judgment was later upheld on appeal by the Court of Cassation, a court whose independence and impartiality have not been impugned (see paragraphs 13-15 above)."", '50. The Government also impressed upon the Court the need to have particular regard to the security context in which the decision to establish National Security Courts was taken pursuant to Article 143 of the Constitution. In view of the experience of the armed forces in the anti ‑ terrorism campaign the authorities had considered it necessary to strengthen these courts by including a military judge in order to provide them with the necessary expertise and knowledge to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State.', '51. The Commission concluded that the Istanbul National Security Court could not be considered an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Commission referred in this respect to its opinion in the Incal v. Turkey case in its Article 31 report adopted on 25 February 1997 and the reasons supporting that opinion.', '52. The Court recalls that in its Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998 (Reports 1998-IV, p. 1504) and in its Çiraklar v. Turkey judgment of 28 October 1998 (Reports 1998-, p. …) the Court had to address arguments similar to those raised by the Government in their pleadings in the instant case. In those judgments the Court noted that the status of military judges sitting as members of National Security Courts did provide certain guarantees of independence and impartiality (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1571, § 65). On the other hand, the Court found that some aspects of these judges’ status made their independence and impartiality questionable ( ibidem, § 68): for example, the fact that they are servicemenwho still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive; or that they remain subject to military discipline; and the fact that decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraph 17 above).', '53. As in its Incal judgment the Court considers that its task is not to determine in abstracto the necessity for the establishment of National Security Courts in the light of the justifications advanced by the Government. Its task is to ascertain whether the manner in which the Istanbul National Security Court functioned infringed Mr Sürek’s right to a fair trial, in particular whether, viewed objectively, he had a legitimate reason to fear that the court which tried him lacked independence and impartiality (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1572, § 70; and the above-mentioned Çiraklar judgment, p. …, § 38).', 'As to that question, the Court sees no reason to reach a conclusion different from that in the cases of Mr Incal and Mr Çiraklar, both of whom, like the present applicant, were civilians. It is understandable that the applicant – prosecuted in a National Security Court for disclosing the identity of officials involved in the fight against terrorism - should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer, who was a member of the Military Legal Service (see paragraph 17 above). On that account he could legitimately fear that the Istanbul National Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant’s fears as to that court’s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction (see the above ‑ mentioned Incal judgment, p.1573, § 72 in fine ).', '54. For these reasons the Court finds that there has been a breach of Article 6 § 1.', 'III. Application of ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION', '55. The applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary and non ‑ pecuniary damage as well as reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in the domestic and Convention proceedings. Article 41 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '56. The applicant claimed the sum of 100, 000 French francs (FRF) by way of compensation for the fine imposed on him and paid (see paragraph 13 above). The amount claimed included interest accrued, took account of the high rate of inflation in the respondent State and was calculated on the basis of an exchange rate from 1992.', '57. The Government maintained that the sum claimed by the applicant was exorbitant having regard to the fact that the applicant was only fined 54,000,000 Turkish liras and he was allowed to pay the fine in monthly instalments.', '58. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment.', '59. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 § 1 would have been, but has found that the respondent State is in breach of Article 10 on account of the applicant’s conviction and sentence. Having regard to the rates of exchange during the relevant period, it considers that in the circumstances the applicant should be awarded FRF 13,000 in respect of pecuniary damage.', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '60. The applicant claimed that as a lawyer his career had been blighted on account of the fact that he has a conviction recorded against him for an offence of terrorism. He requested the Court to award him the sum of FRF 80,000 by way of compensation for moral damage.', '61. The Government argued that if the Court were minded to find a violation in this case that finding would constitute in itself sufficient just satisfaction under this head.', '62. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment on this limb of the applicant’s claim either.', '63. The Court considers that the applicant may be taken to have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the applicant in compensation the sum of FRF 30,000 under this head.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '64. The applicant claimed the legal costs and expenses (translation, postal, communications and travel expenditure) which he incurred in the proceeding before the domestic courts and the Convention institutions. He assessed these at 50,000 FRF. As to the proceedings before the Commission and Court he stated that his lawyer’s fees were based on the Turkish Bar Association’s minimum rate scales. The applicant added that the total amount claimed took account of the high level of inflation in Turkey and was based on current exchange rates.', '65. The Government stated that the amount claimed was exaggerated in comparison with fees earned by Turkish lawyers in the domestic courts and had not been properly justified. The case was simple and had not required much effort on the part of the applicant’s lawyer who had dealt with it throughout the proceedings in his own language. They cautioned against the making of an award which would only constitute a source of unjust enrichment having regard to the socio-economic situation in the respondent State.', '66. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment.', '67. The Court notes that the applicant’s lawyer has been associated with the preparation of other cases before the Court concerning complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention which are based on similar facts. Deciding on an equitable basis and according to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among many other authorities, the above-mentioned Nikolova v. Bulgaria judgment Reports 1999-... p. …, § 79), the Court awards the applicant the sum of FRF 15,000.', 'D. Default interest', '68. The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment which, according to the information available to it, is 3.47 % per annum.']",2,tr,001-58280,0

The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.', '9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul.', 'B. The impugned news commentary', '10. In issue No. 42 of the review, dated 9 January 1993, a news commentary entitled “In Botan the poor peasants are expropriating the landlords!” was published.', 'The relevant parts of this news commentary read:', '“...', '‘The waves of the earthquake centred on Botan have reached all of Kurdistan. The national liberation struggle, growing like the ripples caused by a stone cast into a pool of water, has already gone past Botan in waves, currently embracing 50 districts in 8 provinces in the active front of armed struggle.’', 'PKK [Kurdistan Workers’ Party ] sources briefly describe the extent of the national struggle in Kurdistan as follows: the said 8 provinces (together with their districts) are Hakkari, Şırnak, Siirt, Mardin, Batman, Urfa and Diyarbakır; while the provinces of Van, Malatya, Bitlis, Muş and Gaziantep and their districts are described as being partially involved in the war.', 'The popular movements in the Botan area, where approximately 4.5 to 5 million Kurds live, which have developed with the rise of the national liberation movement, have made rapid strides in the years 1990-92. The political point reached in the area is that the State has almost become inoperative. ...', 'The domain vacated by the State in the political sense has since been occupied by the PKK in the rural areas and H.E.P. organisations in the cities. ...', 'Land cannot be redistributed before it is transferred to the free will of the Kurdish people, because it is inconceivable to distribute land that bears the seal of the Republic of Turkey. ...', 'Today, our struggle is an external war directed against the forces of the Republic of Turkey. ...', 'We want to wage a total liberation struggle. ...”', '11. On 10 January 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court ( İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi ) ordered the seizure of this edition of the review on the ground that, allegedly, it disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the State.', 'C. The charges against the applicant', '12. In an indictment dated 28 January 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The charges were brought under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (-“the 1991 Act”; see paragraph 16 below) on account of the publication of the above news commentary, which concerned, inter alia, the activities of the PKK.', 'D. The applicant’s conviction', '13. In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the commentary on which the charges were based in fact criticised the activities of the PKK. He invoked Article 10 of the Convention and referred to the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinions, including those opinions which shock or offend, is essential in a democratic society. He argued that the provisions of section 8 of the 1991 Act restrict the right to freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down by the case-law of the Commission and the Court.', '14. In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of making propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The applicant was first sentenced to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). Thereupon the Court, considering the good conduct of the applicant during the trial, reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333.', 'The National Security Court, considering those parts of the news commentary cited at paragraph 10 above in the light of the article as a whole, observed that it referred to certain parts of Turkey as “Kurdistan”. Moreover, in the words of the Court, it described the acts of the “PKK terrorist organisation” as a national liberation struggle, which amounted to propaganda aimed at undermining the indivisibility of the State.', 'E. The applicant’s appeal against conviction and subsequent proceedings', '15. The applicant appealed. He, inter alia, reiterated the defence he had relied on before the National Security Court. On 18 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, upholding the cogency of the National Security Court’s assessment of evidence.']","['II. relevant domestic law', 'A.

Turkey (no. 1) judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.', 'PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION', '19. Mr Kamil Tekin Sürek applied to the Commission on 18 July 1994. He complained that his conviction and sentence constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention and that his case had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He also maintained that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time, which gave rise to a separate violation of Article 6 § 1.', '20. The Commission declared the application (no. 24735/94) admissible on 2 September 1996, with the exception of the applicant’s Article 6 § 1 complaint relating to the length of the criminal proceedings in his case. In its report of 13 January 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the opinionthat there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (31 votes to 1) but that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (31 votes to 1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the separate opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment [1].', 'FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT', '21. The applicant requested the Court to find the respondent State in breach of its obligations under Articles 6 § 1 and 10 of the Convention and to award him just satisfaction under Article 41.', 'The Government for their part invited the Court to reject the applicant’s complaints.', 'AS TO THE LAW', 'I. alleged violation of article 10 oF THE CONVENTION', '22. The applicant alleged that the authorities had unjustifiably interfered with his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.', '2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”', '23. The Government maintained that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was justified under the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 10. The Commission agreed with the Government on this point.', 'A. Existence of an interference', '24. The Court notes that it is clear, and this has not been disputed, that there has been an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression on account of his conviction and sentence under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”).', 'B. Justification of the interference', '25. The interference contravened Article 10 unless it was “prescribed by law”, had one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such aim or aims. The Court will examine each of these criteria in turn.', '1. “Prescribed by law”', '26. It was not disputed in the present case that the interference had a legal basis in section 8 of the 1991 Act and was “prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.', '27. The Court, like the Commission, accepts that since the applicant’s conviction was based on section 8 of the 1991 Act the resultant interference with his right to freedom of expression could be regarded as “prescribed by law”, all the more so given that the applicant has not specifically disputed this.', '2. Legitimate aim', '28. The applicant did not dispute that the interference pursued a legitimate aim under the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.', '29. The Government submitted that the applicant’s conviction had been imposed in the interests of national unity and security, territorial integrity and for the prevention of disorder or crime.', '30. The Commission considered that the applicant’s conviction for dissemination of separatist propaganda was part of the authorities’ efforts of the authorities to combat illegal terrorist activities and to maintain national security and public safety.', '31. The Court considers that, having regard to the sensitivity of the security situation in south-east Turkey (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2539, § 10) and to the need for the authorities to be alert to acts capable of fuelling additional violence, the measures taken against the applicant can be said to have been in furtherance of certain of the aims mentioned by the Government, namely the protectionof national security and territorial integrity and the prevention of disorder and crime. This is certainly true where, as with the situation in south-east Turkey at the time of the circumstances of this case, the separatist movement had recourse to methods which rely on the use of violence.', '3. “Necessary in a democratic society”', '(a) Arguments of those appearing before the Court', '(i) The applicant', '32. The applicant complained that, although he was the owner of the review with no editorial responsibility for its content, he had nonetheless been punished for the dissemination of terrorist propaganda under section 8 of the 1991 Act. He submitted that the impugned statements had formed part of an objective news report aimed at providing the public with information on land reform and unemployment in south-eastern Turkey, giving both the Government’s and the PKK’s point of view, without expressing any support for terrorist activities. Neither the review nor the applicant himself had any links with the PKK.', '(ii) The Government', '33. The Government maintained that the news commentary in question had presented the activities of the PKK, an illegal terrorist organisation, as acts of national liberation.', 'In their submission, separatist propaganda inevitably incites to violence and provokes hostility among the various groups in Turkish society, thus endangering human rights and democracy. As the owner of the review the applicant had participated in the dissemination of separatist propaganda by publishing an article which, by attempting in a veiled but nonetheless obvious manner to vindicate a terrorist organisation, threatened fundamental interests of the national community such as territorial integrity, national unity and security and the prevention of disorder and crime.', '34. In the Government’s view the measures taken against the applicant were within the authorities’ margin of appreciation in relation to the type of activity which endangers the vital interests of the State and the taking of these measure in the instant case found its justification under paragraph 2 of Article 10.', '(iii) The Commission', '35. The Commission observed that the commentary had contained statements which, when read in the context of the article as a whole, werecapable of creating among readers the impression that the author of the commentary was encouraging, or even calling for, continued armed action against the Turkish State and was thus supporting violence for separatist purposes. The Commission considered that the authorities of the respondent State had been entitled to take the view that the publication of the news commentary was harmful to national security and public safety. As the owner of the review, the applicant assumed duties and responsibilities with respect to its publication. Having regard to the State’s margin of appreciation, the applicant’s conviction and sentence could be considered in the circumstances a proportionate response to a pressing social need to maintain national security and public safety. The Commission concluded that there had been no violation of Article 10 in the circumstances of the case.', '(b) The Court’s assessment', '36. The Court reiterates the fundamental principles underlying its judgments relating to Article 10, as set out in, for example, its Zana v. Turkey judgment (cited above, pp. 2547-48, § 51) and in its Fressoz and Roire v. France judgment of 21 January 1999 ( Reports 1999-, p. …, § 45).', '(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.', '(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.', '(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.', '37. The Court further recalls that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest (see the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996 Reports 1996-V, p. 1957, § 58). Moreover, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Furthermore, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries. Nevertheless it certainly remains open to the competent State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see the Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June1998, Reports-IV, p. 1567, § 54). Finally, where such remarks incite to violence against an individual or a public official or a sector of the population, the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression.', '38. Since the applicant was convicted of disseminating separatist propaganda through the medium of the review of which he was the owner, the impugned interference must also be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of political democracy (see among many other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A, no.103, p. 26, § 41; and the above-mentioned Fressoz and Roire judgment, p…., § 45). While the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for the protection of vital interests of the State such as national security or territorial integrity against the threat of violence or the prevention of crime or disorder, it is nevertheless incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues, including divisive ones. Not only has the press the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public has a right to receive them. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideasand attitudes of political leaders (see the above-mentioned Lingens judgment, p. 26 §§ 41-42).', '39. The Court will have particular regard to the words used in the article and to the context in which it was published. In this latter respect it will take into account the background to cases submitted to it, particularly the problems linked to the prevention of terrorism (see the above-mentioned Incal v. Turkey judgment, p. 1568, § 58).', '40. The article at issue referred to parts of the Turkish territory as “Kurdistan” and to the existence of a national liberation struggle. In the Court’s view, although these are no doubt relevant considerations, they cannot of their own be deemed sufficient to regard the interference as necessary within the meaning of Article 10 § 2.', 'On the other hand, while describing the struggle as a “war directed against the forces of the Republic of Turkey”, the article asserts that “[w] e want to wage a total liberation struggle”. Thus, it is clear that the impugned article associated itself with the PKK and expressed a call for the use of armed force as a means to achieve national independence of Kurdistan.', 'It is further to be noted that the article was published in the context of the security situation in south-east Turkey, where since approximately 1985 serious disturbances have raged between the security forces and the members of the PKK involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the region (see the above ‑ mentioned Zana judgment, p. 2539, § 10). In such a context the content of the article must be seen as capable of inciting to further violence in the region. Indeed the message which is communicated to the reader is that recourse to violence is a necessary and justified measure of self-defence in the face of the aggressor. It is in this perspective that the Court finds that that reasons adduced by the respondent State for the applicant’s conviction are both relevant and sufficient to ground an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression. The Court reiterates that the mere fact that “information” or “ideas” offend, shock or disturb does not suffice to justify that interference (see paragraph 36 above). What is in issue in the instant case, however, is incitement to violence.', '41. While it is true that the applicant did not personally associate himself with the views contained in the news commentary, he nevertheless provided its writer with an outlet for stirring up violence. The Court does not accept his argument that he should be exonerated from any criminal liability for the content of the article on account of the fact that he only has a commercial and not an editorial relationship with the review. He was an owner and as such had the power to shape the editorial direction of the review. For that reason, he was vicariously subject to the “duties and responsibilities” which the review’s editorial and journalist staff undertake in the collection anddissemination of information to the public and which assume an even greater importance in situations of conflict and tension.', '42. In view of the above considerations the Court concludes that the penalty imposed on the applicant as the owner of the review could reasonably be regarded as answering a “pressing social need” and that the reasons adduced by the authorities for the applicant’s conviction are “relevant and sufficient”.', '43. For these reasons and having regard to the margin of appreciation which national authorities have in such a case, the Court considers that the interference at issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. There has consequently been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention in the circumstances of this case.', 'II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION', 'A. The Government’s preliminary objection', '44. In their memorial to the Court the Government maintained that the applicant, not having raised before the domestic courts his complaint that his case had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal, had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 of the Convention.', '45. The Court reiterates that it takes cognisance of preliminary objections in so far as the State in question has already raised them, at least in substance and with sufficient clarity, before the Commission, in principle at the stage of the initial examination of admissibility (see, for instance, the Aytekin v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p. § 77). However, it does not appear from the observations submitted by the Government to the Commission on 31 July 1995 (at the admissibility stage) or their supplementary observations submitted on 4 March 1997 (at the merits stage) that they objected, on the ground of non-exhaustion, to the admissibility of the above-mentioned complaint. Accordingly, they are estopped from raising their preliminary objection.', 'B. The merits of the applicant’s complaint', '46. The applicant complained that he had been denied a fair hearing in breach of the Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the National Security Court which tried and convicted him. In so far as is relevant Article 6 § 1 provides:', '“In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...”', '47. The Government contested this allegation whereas the Commission accepted it.', '48. In the applicant’s submission the military judges appointed to the National Security Courts such as the Istanbul National Security Court were dependent on the executive, being appointed by the joint decree of the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister subject to the approval of the President of the Republic. He pointed to the fact that their professional assessment and promotion as well as their security of tenure were within the control of the executive branch and in turn the army. The ties which bound them to the executive and to the army made it impossible for military judges to discharge their functions on the bench in an independent and impartial manner. The applicant further stressed that the independence and impartiality of military judges and hence of the courts on which they sat were compromised since these judges were unable to take a position which might be contradictory to the views of their commanding officers.', 'The applicant stated that these considerations impaired the independence and impartiality of the IstanbulNational Security Court and prevented him from receiving a fair trial, in violation of Article 6 § 1.', '49. The Government replied that the rules governing the appointment of military judges to the National Security Courts and the guarantees which they enjoy in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The Government disputed the applicant’s argument that military judges were accountable to their superior officers. In the first place, it was an offence under section 112 of the Military Code for a public official to attempt to influence the performance by a military judge of his judicial functions (see paragraph 18 above). Secondly, the assessment reports referred to by the applicant related only to conduct of a military judge’s non-judicial duties. Military judges had access to their assessment reports and were able to challenge their content before the Military Supreme Administrative Court ( ibidem ). When acting in a judicial capacity a military judge was assessed in exactly the same manner as a civilian judge.', '50. The Government further averred that the fairness of the applicant’s trial had not been prejudiced by reason of the presence of a military judge on the bench. They claimed that neither the military judge’s hierarchical authorities nor the public authorities which had appointed him to the courthad any interest in the proceedings or in the outcome of case. The Istanbul National Security Court’s judgment was later upheld on appeal by the Court of Cassation, a court whose independence and impartiality have not been impugned (see paragraphs 12-14 above).', '51. The Government also impressed upon the Court the need to have particular regard to the security context in which the decision to establish National Security Courts was taken pursuant to Article 143 of the Constitution. In view of the experience of the armed forces in the anti-terrorism campaign the authorities had considered it necessary to strengthen these courts by including a military judge in order to provide them with the necessary expertise and knowledge to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State.', '52. The Commission concluded that the Istanbul National Security Court could not be considered an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Commission referred in this respect to its opinion in the Incal v. Turkey case in its Article 31 report adopted on 25 February 1997 and the reasons supporting that opinion.', '53. The Court recalls than in its Incal v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998 (Reports 1998-IV, p. 1504) and in its Çiraklar v. Turkey judgment of 28 October 1998 (Reports 1998-, p. …) the Court had to address arguments similar to those raised by the Government in their pleadings in the instant case. In those judgments the Court noted that the status of military judges sitting as members of National Security Courts did provide certain guarantees of independence and impartiality (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1571, § 65). On the other hand, the Court found that some aspects of these judges’ status made their independence and impartiality questionable ( ibidem, § 68): for example, the fact that they are servicemen who still belong to the army, which in turn takes its orders from the executive; or that they remain subject to military discipline and decisions pertaining to their appointment are to a great extent taken by the administrative authorities and the army (see paragraph 18 above).', '54. As in its Incal judgment the Court considers that its task is not to determine in abstracto the necessity for the establishment of National Security Courts in the light of the justifications advanced by the Government. Its task is to ascertain whether the manner in which the IstanbulNational Security Court functioned infringed Mr Sürek’s right to a fair trial, in particular whether, viewed objectively, he had a legitimate reason to fear that the court which tried him lacked independence and impartiality (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p. 1572, § 70; and the above-mentioned Çiraklar judgment, p. …, § 38).', 'As to that question, the Court sees no reason to reach a conclusion different from that in the cases of Mr Incal and Mr Çiraklar, both of whom, like the present applicant, were civilians. It is understandable that the applicant – prosecuted in a National Security Court for disseminating propaganda aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the State and national unity - should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer, who was a member of the Military Legal Service (see paragraph 18 above). On that account he could legitimately fear that the IstanbulNational Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant’s fears as to that court’s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation were not able to dispel these fears since that court did not have full jurisdiction (see the above-mentioned Incal judgment, p.1573, § 72 in fine ).', '55. For these reasons the Court finds that there has been a breach of Article 6 § 1.', 'III. Application of ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION', '56. The applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary and non ‑ pecuniary damage as well as reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in the domestic and Convention proceedings. Article 41 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', 'A. Pecuniary damage', '57. The applicant claimed the sum of 100,000 French Francs (FRF) by way of compensation for the fine imposed on him and paid (see paragraph 14 above). The amount claimed included interest accrued, took account of the high rate of inflation in the respondent State and was calculated on the basis of an exchange rate from 1993.', '58. The Government maintained that the sum claimed by the applicant was exorbitant having regard to the fact that the applicant was only fined 83,333,333 Turkish liras and he was allowed to pay the fine in monthly instalments. The Government also pointed out that the applicant had not provided any details to substantiate the amount claimed for his alleged out-of-pocket expenses.', '59. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment.', '60. The Court would observe that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 § 1 would have been, irrespective of its own finding that the respondent State is not in breach of Article 10 on account of the applicant’s conviction and sentence. It considers that in the circumstances the applicant’s claim should be disallowed.', 'B. Non-pecuniary damage', '61. The applicant claimed that as a lawyer his career had been blighted on account of the fact that he has a conviction recorded against him for an offence of terrorism. He requested the Court to award him the sum of FRF 80,000 by way of compensation for moral damage.', '62. The Government argued that if the Court were minded to find a violation in this case that finding would constitute in itself sufficient just satisfaction under this head.', '63. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment on this limb of the applicant’s claim either.', '64. The Court recalls that it has found that there has been no violation of Article 10 on the facts of this case. It considers that a finding of a violation of Article 6 § 1 constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the applicant’s alleged non-pecuniary damage.', 'C. Costs and expenses', '65. The applicant claimed the legal costs and expenses (translation, postal, communications and travel expenditure) which he incurred in the proceeding before the domestic courts and the Convention institutions. He assessed these at FRF 50,000. As to the proceedings before the Commission and Court the applicant stated that his lawyer’s fees were based on the Turkish Bar Association’s minimum rate scales. The applicant added that the total amount claimed took account of the high level of inflation in Turkey and was based on current exchanges rate.', '66. The Government stated that the amount claimed was exaggerated in comparison with fees earned by Turkish lawyers in the domestic courts and had not been properly justified. The case was simple and had not required much effort on the part of the applicant’s lawyer who had dealt with it throughout the proceedings in his own language. They cautioned against the making of an award which would only constitute a source of unjust enrichment having regard to the socio-economic situation in the respondent State.', '67. The Delegate of the Commission did not comment.', '68. The Court notes that it has found a breach only in respect of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. It further notes that the applicant’s lawyer has been associated with the preparation of other cases before the Court concerning complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention which are based on similar facts. Deciding on an equitable basis and according to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among many other authorities, the Nikolova v. Bulgaria judgment of 25 March 1999, Reports 1999-, p. …, § 79), the Court awards the applicant the overall sum of FRF 15,000.', 'D. Default interest', '69. The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment, which, according to the information available to it, is 3.47 % per annum.']",2,tr,001-58281,0
